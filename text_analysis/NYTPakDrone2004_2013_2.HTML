</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN  testimony last week before Congress, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, insisted that President Obama's revised war strategy will ''build support for the Afghan government,'' while Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander there, vowed that it will ''absolutely'' succeed in disrupting and degrading the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Confidence is important, but we also have to recognize that the decision to commit 30,000 more troops to a counterinsurgency effort against a good segment of the Afghan population, with the focus on converting a deeply unpopular and corrupt regime into a unified, centralized state for the first time in that country's history, is far from a slam dunk. In the worst case, the surge may push General McChrystal's ''core goal of defeating Al Qaeda'' further away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda is already on the ropes globally, with ever-dwindling financial and popular support, and a drastically diminished ability to work  with other extremists worldwide, much less command them in major operations. Its lethal agents are being systematically hunted down, while those Muslims whose souls it seeks to save are increasingly revolted by its methods. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unfortunately, this weakening viral movement may have a new lease on life in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because we are pushing the Taliban into its arms. By overestimating the threat from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, we are making it a greater threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the world. Afghanistan and the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are unlike Iraq, the ancient birthplace of central government, or 1960s Vietnam, where a strong state was backing the Communist insurgents. Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be dealt with on their own terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're winning against Al Qaeda and its kin in places where antiterrorism efforts are local and built on an understanding that the ties binding terrorist networks today are more cultural and familial than political. Consider recent events in Southeast Asia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September, Indonesian security forces killed Noordin Muhammad Top, then on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist list. Implicated in the region's worst suicide bombings -- including the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton bombings in Jakarta last July 17 -- Noordin Top headed a splinter group of the extremist religious organization Jemaah Islamiyah (he called it Al Qaeda for the Malaysian Archipelago). Research by my colleagues and me, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department, reveals three critical factors in such groups inspired by Al Qaeda, all of which local security forces implicitly grasp but American counterintelligence workers seem to underestimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What binds these groups together? First is friendship forged through fighting: the Indonesian volunteers who fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan styled themselves the Afghan Alumni, and many kept in contact when they returned home after the war. The second is school ties and discipleship: many leading operatives in Southeast Asia come from a handful of religious schools affiliated with Jemaah Islamiyah. Out of some 30,000 religious schools in Indonesia, only about 50 have a deadly legacy of producing violent extremists. Third is family ties; as anyone who has watched the opening scene from ''The Godfather'' knows, weddings can be terrific opportunities for networking and plotting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Understanding these three aspects of terrorist networking has given law enforcement a leg up on the jihadists. Gen. Tito Karnavian, the leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team that tracked down Noordin Top, told me that ''knowledge of the interconnected networks of Afghan Alumni, kinship and marriage groups was very crucial to uncovering the inner circle of Noordin.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Consider Noordin Top's third marriage, which cemented ties to key suspects in the lead-up to the recent hotel bombings. His father-in-law, who founded a Jemaah Islamiyah-related boarding school, stashed explosives in his garden with the aid of another teacher at the school. Using electronic intercepts and tracing family, school and alumni ties, police officers found the cache in late June 2009. That discovery may have prompted Noordin Top to initiate the hotel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ahead of a planned simultaneous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the residence of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, an Afghan Alumnus and nephew of Noordin Top's father-in-law was being pursued by the police for his role in a failed plot to blow up a tourist cafe on Sumatra. Unfortunately, Noordin Top struck the hotels before the Indonesian police could penetrate the entire network, in part because another family group was still operating under the police radar. This group included a florist who smuggled the bombs into the hotels and a man whose eventual arrest led to discovery of the plot against the president. Both terrorists were married to sisters of a Yemeni-trained imam who recruited the hotel suicide bombers, and of another brother who had infiltrated Indonesia's national airline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Had the police pulled harder on the pieces of social yarn they had in hand, they might have unraveled the hotel plot earlier. Still, their work thwarted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned for the future, including that on the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similarly, security officials in the Philippines have combined intelligence from American and Australian sources with similar tracking efforts to crack down on their terrorist networks, and as a result most extremist groups are either seeking reconciliation with the government -- including the deadly Moro Islamic Liberation Front on the island of Mindanao -- or have devolved into kidnapping-and-extortion gangs with no ideological focus. The separatist Abu Sayyaf Group, once the most feared force in the region, now has no overall spiritual or military leaders, few weapons and only a hundred or so fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, how does this relate to a strategy against Al Qaeda in the West and in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Al Qaeda's main focus is harming the United States and Europe, but there hasn't been a successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in these places directly commanded by Osama bin Laden and company since 9/11. The American invasion of Afghanistan devastated Al Qaeda's core of top personnel and its training camps. In a recent briefing to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Marc Sageman, a former C.I.A. case officer, said that recent history ''refutes claims by some heads of the intelligence community that all Islamist plots in the West can be traced back to the Afghan-Pakistani border.'' The real threat is homegrown youths who gain inspiration from Osama bin Laden but little else beyond an occasional self-financed spell at a degraded Qaeda-linked training facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 2003 invasion of Iraq encouraged many of these local plots, including the train bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005. In their aftermaths, European law and security forces stopped plots from coming to fruition by stepping up coordination and tracking links among local extremists, their friends and friends of friends, while also improving relations with young Muslim immigrants through community outreach. Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have taken similar steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we need to bring this perspective to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- one that is smart about cultures, customs and connections. The present policy of focusing on troop strength and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and trying to win over people by improving their lives with Western-style aid programs, only continues a long history of foreign involvement and failure. Reading a thousand years of Arab and Muslim history would show little in the way of patterns that would have helped to predict 9/11, but our predicament in Afghanistan rhymes with the past like a limerick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A key factor helping the Taliban is the moral outrage of the Pashtun tribes against those who deny them autonomy, including a right to bear arms to defend their tribal code, known as Pashtunwali. Its sacred tenets include protecting women's purity (namus), the right to personal revenge (badal), the sanctity of the guest (melmastia) and sanctuary (nanawateh). Among all Pashtun tribes, inheritance, wealth, social prestige and political status accrue through the father's line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This social structure means that there can be no suspicion that the male pedigree (often traceable in lineages spanning centuries) is ''corrupted'' by doubtful paternity. Thus, revenge for sexual misbehavior (rape, adultery, abduction) warrants killing seven members of the offending group and often the ''offending'' woman. Yet hospitality trumps vengeance: if a group accepts a guest, all must honor him, even if prior grounds justify revenge. That's one reason American offers of millions for betraying Osama bin Laden fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan hill societies have withstood centuries of would-be conquests by keeping order with Pashtunwali in the absence of central authority. When seemingly intractable conflicts arise, rival parties convene councils, or jirgas, of elders and third parties to seek solutions through consensus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 9/11, the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, assembled a council of clerics to judge his claim that Mr. bin Laden was the country's guest and could not be surrendered. The clerics countered that because a guest should not cause his host problems, Mr. bin Laden should leave. But instead of keeping pressure on the Taliban to resolve the issue in ways they could live with, the United States ridiculed their deliberation and bombed them into a closer alliance with Al Qaeda. Pakistani Pashtuns then offered to help out their Afghan brethren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American-sponsored ''reconciliation'' efforts between the Afghan government and the Taliban may be fatally flawed if they include demands that Pashtun hill tribes give up their arms and support a Constitution that values Western-inspired rights and judicial institutions over traditions that have sustained the tribes against all enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, suggest that victory in Afghanistan is possible if the Taliban who pursue self-interest rather than ideology can be co-opted with material incentives. But as the veteran war reporter Jason Burke of The Observer of London told me: ''Today, the logical thing for the Pashtun conservatives is to stop fighting and get rich through narcotics or Western aid, the latter being much lower risk. But many won't sell out.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why? In part because outsiders who ignore local group dynamics tend to ride roughshod over values they don't grasp. My research with colleagues on group conflict in India, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Palestinian territories found that helping to improve lives materially does little to reduce support for violence, and can even increase it if people feel such help compromises their most cherished values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The original alliance between the Taliban and Al Qaeda was largely one of convenience between a poverty-stricken national movement and a transnational cause that brought it material help. American pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Taliban and Al Qaeda in their sanctuary gave birth to the Pakistani Taliban, who forged their own ties to Al Qaeda to fight the Pakistani state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While some Taliban groups use the rhetoric of global jihad to inspire ranks or enlist foreign fighters, the Pakistani Taliban show no inclination to go after Western interests abroad. Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which have included at least three assaults near nuclear facilities, warrant concerted action -- but in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, not in Afghanistan. As Mr. Sageman, the former C.I.A. officer, puts it: ''There's no Qaeda in Afghanistan and no Afghans in Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long preferred a policy of ''respect for the independence and sentiment of the tribes'' that was advised in 1908 by Lord Curzon, the British viceroy of India who established the North-West Frontier Province as a buffer zone to ''conciliate and contain'' the Pashtun hill tribes. In 1948, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, removed all troops from brigade level up in Waziristan and other tribal areas in a plan aptly called Operation Curzon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The problem today is that Al Qaeda is prodding the Pakistani Taliban to hit state institutions in the hopes of provoking a full-scale invasion of the tribal areas by the Pakistani Army; the idea is that such an assault would rally the tribes to Al Qaeda's cause and threaten the state. The United States has been pushing for exactly that sort of potentially disastrous action by Islamabad. But holding to Curzon's line may still be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> best bet. The key in the Afghan-Pakistani area, as in Southeast Asia, is to use local customs and networks to our advantage. Of course, counterterrorism measures are only as effective as local governments that execute them. Afghanistan's government is corrupt, unpopular and inept. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides, there's really no Taliban central authority to talk to.  To be Taliban today means little more than to be a Pashtun tribesman who believes that his fundamental beliefs and customary way of life are threatened. Although most Taliban claim loyalty to Afghanistan's Mullah Omar, this allegiance varies greatly. Many Pakistani Taliban leaders -- including Baitullah Mehsud, who was killed by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, and his successor, Hakimullah Mehsud -- rejected Mullah Omar's call to forgo suicide bombings against Pakistani civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, it is the United States that holds today's Taliban together. Without us, their deeply divided coalition could well fragment. Taliban resurgence depends on support from those notoriously unruly hill tribes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border regions, who are unsympathetic to the original Taliban program of homogenizing tribal custom and politics under one rule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It wouldn't be surprising if the Taliban were to sever ties to Mr. bin Laden if he became a bigger headache to them than America. Al Qaeda may have close relations to the network of Jalaluddin Haqqani, an Afghan Taliban leader living in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and the Shabi Khel branch of the Mehsud tribe in Waziristan, but it isn't wildly popular with many other Taliban factions and forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike Al Qaeda, the Taliban are interested in their homeland, not ours. Things are different now than before 9/11. The Taliban know how costly Osama bin Laden's friendship can be. There's a good chance that enough factions in the loose Taliban coalition would opt to disinvite their troublesome guest if we forget about trying to subdue them or hold their territory. This would unwind the Taliban coalition into a lot of straggling, loosely networked groups that could be eliminated or contained using the lessons learned in Indonesia and elsewhere. This means tracking down family and tribal networks, gaining a better understanding of family ties and intervening only when we see actions by Taliban and other groups to aid Al Qaeda or act outside their region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To defeat violent extremism in Afghanistan, less may be more -- just as it has been elsewhere in Asia. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demands by the United States for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to crack down on the strongest Taliban warrior in Afghanistan, Siraj Haqqani, whose fighters pose the biggest threat to American forces, have been rebuffed by the Pakistani military, according to Pakistani military officials and diplomats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration wants </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to turn on Mr. Haqqani, a longtime asset of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency who uses the tribal area of North Waziristan as his sanctuary. But, the officials said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views the entreaties as contrary to its interests in Afghanistan beyond the timetable of President Obama's surge, which envisions reducing American forces beginning in mid-2011. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The demands, first made by senior American officials before President Obama's Afghanistan speech and repeated many times since, were renewed in a written message delivered in recent days by the United States Embassy to the head of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, according to American officials. Gen. David H. Petraeus followed up on Monday during a visit to Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The demands have been accompanied by strong suggestions that if the Pakistanis cannot take care of the problem, including dismantling the Taliban leadership based in Quetta, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, then the Americans will by resorting to broader and more frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Pakistani leadership has greeted the refrain with public silence and private anger, according to Pakistani officials and diplomats familiar with the conversations, illustrating the widening gulf between the allies over the Afghan war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former Pakistani military officers voice irritation with the Americans daily on television, part of a mounting grievance in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the alliance with the United States is too costly to bear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is really beginning to irk and anger us,'' said a security official familiar with the deliberations at the senior levels of the Pakistani leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The core reason for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imperviousness is its scant faith in the Obama troop surge, and what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees as the need to position itself for a regional realignment in Afghanistan once American forces begin to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It considers Mr. Haqqani and his control of large areas of Afghan territory vital to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the jostling for influence that will pit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, India, Russia, China and Iran against one another in the post-American Afghan arena, the Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is particularly eager to counter the growing influence of its archenemy, India, which is pouring $1.2 billion in aid into Afghanistan. ''If America walks away, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very worried that it will have India on its eastern border and India on its western border in Afghanistan,'' said Tariq Fatemi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States who is pro-American in his views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For that reason, Mr. Fatemi said, the Pakistani Army is ''very reluctant'' to jettison Mr. Haqqani, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strong card in Afghanistan. Moreover, the Pakistanis do not want to alienate Mr. Haqqani because they consider him an important player in reconciliation efforts that they would like to see get under way in Afghanistan immediately, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because Mr. Haqqani shelters Qaeda leaders and operatives in North Waziristan, Washington is opposed to including Mr. Haqqani among the possible reconcilable Taliban, at least for the moment, a Western diplomat said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his reply to the Americans, General Kayani stressed a short-term argument, according to two Pakistani officials familiar with the response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currently has its hands full fighting the Pakistani Taliban in South Waziristan and other places, and it is beyond its capacity to open another front against the Afghan Taliban, the officials said of General Kayani's response. The offensive has had the secondary effect of constraining the Haqqani network in North Waziristan and driving some of its commanders and fighters across the border to Afghanistan, senior American military officials in Afghanistan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But implicit in General Kayani's reply was the fact that the homegrown Pakistani Taliban represent the real threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. General Kayani argued that they are the ones carrying out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against security installations and civilian markets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities and must be the army's top priority, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For his part, Mr. Haqqani fights in Afghanistan, and is considered more of an asset than a threat by the Pakistanis. But he is the most potent force fighting the United States, American and Pakistani officials agree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has subcommanders threaded throughout eastern and southern Afghanistan. His fighters control Paktika, Paktia and Khost Provinces in Afghanistan, which lie close to North Waziristan. His men are also strong in Ghazni, Logar and Wardak Provinces, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because Mr. Haqqani now spends so much time in Afghanistan -- about three weeks of every month, according to a Pakistani security official -- if the Americans want to eliminate him, their troops should have ample opportunity to capture him, Pakistani security officials argue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a leading mujahedeen fighter against the Soviets who is now aged and apparently confined to bed, Siraj Haqqani is keeper of a formidable lineage and history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the early 1970s, the father attended a well-known madrasa, Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqaniya in the Pakistani town of Akora Khattack in North-West Frontier Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1980s, Jalaluddin Haqqani received money and arms from the C.I.A. routed through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, to fight the Soviets, according to Ahmed Rashid, an expert on the Afghan Taliban and the author of ''Descent Into Chaos.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1990s, when the Taliban ran Afghanistan, Jalaluddin Haqqani served as governor of Paktia Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The relationship between the Haqqanis and Osama bin Laden dates back to the war against the Soviets in the 1980s, according to Kamran Bokhari, the South Asia director for Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the Taliban government collapsed at the end of 2001 and Qaeda operatives fled from Tora Bora to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Haqqanis relocated their command structure to North Waziristan and welcomed Al Qaeda, Mr. Bokhari said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The biggest gift of the Pakistanis to the Haqqanis was the use of North Waziristan as their fief, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army did not appear to be assisting the Haqqanis with training or equipment, he said. More than 20 members of the Haqqani family were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan last year, showing the limits of how far the Pakistanis could protect them, Mr. Bokhari said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, Siraj Haqqani has anywhere from 4,000 to 12,000 Taliban under his command. He is technically a member of the Afghan Taliban leadership based in Quetta, the capital of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baluchistan Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That leadership is headed by Mullah Omar, the former leader of the Taliban regime. But Mr. Haqqani operates fairly independently of them inside Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He funds his operations in part through kidnappings and other illicit activities. The Haqqani network held David Rohde, a correspondent for The New York Times, for seven months, seeking ransom until he escaped in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Siraj Haqqani maintains an uneasy relationship with the Pakistani Taliban, said Maulana Yousaf Shah, the administrator of the madrasa at Akora Khattack. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haqqani believed the chief jihadi objective should be forcing the foreigners out of Afghanistan, and he had tried but failed to redirect the Pakistani Taliban tofight in Afghanistan as well, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exceptionally heavy barrage by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, five Predator aircraft fired 10 missiles at suspected militant compounds along the border with Afghanistan on Thursday. Along with an earlier </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at least 15 people, including 7 foreigners, were killed, Pakistani security officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stepped-up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came as the civilian government felt the repercussions of a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday that declared unconstitutional an amnesty for thousands of politicians accused of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, the National Accountability Bureau, acting with remarkable speed, prohibited 247 people, including some cabinet ministers, from leaving the country, as corruption cases could be revived against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They included Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, who was stopped at the Islamabad airport, along with his wife and secretary, from boarding a flight to China, where he was scheduled to make an official visit. He complained publicly that he had not been informed of the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> included two missiles that hit at a vehicle in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, killing at least one person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second, heavier assault took place at the village of Degan, hometown of a Pakistani Taliban commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, and a haven for foreign fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said the seven foreigners killed were Arabs, including a commander named Zohaib al-Zahidi, though it could be independently verified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Degan, a target of previous missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is about 15 miles west of Miram Shah, capital of North Waziristan, and is within Datta Khel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has stepped up the pace and intensity of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year, which now number more than 40, fanning anti-American sentiment over increased civilian deaths and sensitivities over Pakistani sovereignty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington has pressed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to expand military operations to include the area of North Waziristan that the missiles hit Thursday, threatening to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants if Islamabad does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The area is a stronghold of local and foreign fighters allied with Al Qaeda; an Afghan commander, Sirajuddin Haqqani; and Mr. Bahadur, the Pakistani Taliban commander, both of whom are involved in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has declared a truce with Mr. Bahadur that it deems essential as it battles militants in neighboring South Waziristan. But American officials believe that North Waziristan has become a haven for Afghan and Qaeda commanders, who use it as a staging ground for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only in Afghanistan but also around the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurgents in Iraq have occasionally intercepted video images sent from American military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to troops in the field, causing the Defense Department to increase its use of encryption over the last year, military and intelligence officials said Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military has made extensive use of the remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for surveillance in Iraq and Afghanistan, using live video images to track insurgents, to catch them burying roadside bombs or to identify their houses or weapons caches. Most of that data is highly encrypted, and it has been critical to guiding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the insurgents, often with missiles fired from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> themselves or from helicopters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Iraqi insurgents had used a $26 commercial software package called Sky Grabber, designed to use a satellite dish to intercept transmissions of movies and music, to capture some of the video feeds from unmanned aerial vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials confirmed that they had become aware of the intercepts last year. But they said that the vulnerability applied only to a subset of transmissions that had been left unencrypted, and that they had no indication that insurgents had gained much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said the vulnerable transmissions occurred when troops with older laptops or handheld controllers sought a direct feed from Predators and smaller surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as from some conventionally piloted aircraft equipped for surveillance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Direct video feeds to the troops have proliferated as the military tries to rush the latest intelligence to even the smallest units in the field, and they are expected to play an important role in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But military officials added that the insurgents would need to be positioned close to the American troops to intercept the feeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said the newest laptops received encrypted signals, just like all the major command centers that receive the main feeds from the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They said those transmissions had not been compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials said they had also been adding encryption, which scrambles the video signal, and taking other steps to reduce the vulnerability of some of the older systems. ''But that is a major undertaking, considering that we have hundreds of U.A.V.'s and hundreds more ground stations,'' one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, would not speak specifically about the interception of the video feeds from unmanned aerial vehicles. But he said Pentagon officials ''constantly evaluate our weapons platforms, including U.A.V.'s, to make sure that they are performing to maximum effect and that any potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities are mitigated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials were always aware of the possibility that unencrypted signals from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be intercepted, but initially chose not to encrypt the more localized links to avoid the additional cost, complexity and weight of the necessary equipment, said Dale W. Meyerrose, a retired Air Force officer who worked on the military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program and later was a senior intelligence official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The communications involving high-value intelligence are indeed encrypted,'' said Mr. Meyerrose, vice president for cyber initiatives at Harris Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials familiar with the separate Central Intelligence Agency </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, which has killed militants with Al Qaeda and the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it always used encryption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials familiar with the technology said the feeds could show what aspects of insurgent activity were being watched by allied forces, but would not typically reveal the location of Western troops. ''I'm really not that concerned,'' said one Air Force official of the intercepts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teenage daughter of Osama bin Laden, who has lived with at least five of her siblings in a guarded compound in Iran since 2001, took refuge last month in the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, and family members are trying to arrange for a large number of relatives to leave Iran for Saudi Arabia or Syria, one of Mr. bin Laden's sons said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The son, Omar bin Laden, broke with his father, the leader of Al Qaeda, before the 2001 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York and on the Pentagon and now lives in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He said that his sister Iman, 19, walked away during a shopping trip in Tehran about a month ago and made her way to the Saudi Embassy, hoping to be reunited with her mother, who lives in Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Omar bin Laden and his wife, Zaina, who is British, said in the interview that at least six of Osama bin Laden's children and one of his wives live in a comfortable compound in Tehran with other relatives, for a total of about 30 family members there. The couple denied that their relatives were under house arrest, as has been widely reported, but acknowledged that Iranian security personnel accompanied them when they left the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to Iman bin Laden, they identified Mr. bin Laden's children living in the Tehran compound as Osman, Mohammed, Fatima, Hazma and Bakr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The status of another son, Saad, remained uncertain. American officials said last summer that they believed that Saad bin Laden had traveled from Iran to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and had been killed by an American missile fired from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar and Zaina bin Laden said Saad was still in the Tehran compound when the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was said to have occurred, but they said that they did not know where he was now or whether he was still alive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The presence of some of Osama bin Laden's family in Iran was previously known, but the report of Iman's seeking refuge in the Saudi Embassy added to the picture of their ambiguous status in Tehran. By several accounts, the bin Laden relatives left Afghanistan shortly before the 9/11  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and were detained in Iran as they tried to get  home to Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Iran, whose relations with Saudi Arabia are tense, the relatives appear to be not exactly prisoners, but not quite guests. Omar and Zaina bin Laden said the bin Ladens in Tehran had been treated well but had no official documents to  permit them to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steve Coll, author of ''The bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century,'' said the news from Tehran ''provides the first open evidence of the circumstances under which bin Laden family members have been living in Iran'' and ''confirms that the Iranians have attempted to keep them under some kind of control.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several Qaeda operatives, including Saif al-Adel, have been reported to be in Iran under house arrest or similar status, and they are suspected of having played a role in directing Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Saudi Arabia in 2003. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Omar bin Laden, 28, who recently published a memoir with his mother, ''Growing Up bin Laden,'' said none of the bin Ladens in Tehran had been involved in Al Qaeda. Speaking of his siblings now in Tehran, he said, ''They are all younger than me and they had nothing to do with 9/11 or any kind of terrorism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement announcing financial sanctions in January against Saad bin Laden and three people accused of being Qaeda operatives in Iran, the Treasury Department said that he had been ''involved in managing the terrorist organization from Iran.'' But an American intelligence official said Wednesday that Saad bin Laden played a minor role in the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Omar and Zaina bin Laden said they had spoken with Osman, 26, and he had told them he believed that Iran would eventually permit the family members to leave the country. They said the 30 relatives in Tehran included about 11 grandchildren, born since the family fled Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People are beginning to realize these children are innocent victims of 9/11,'' Zaina bin Laden said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretive branches of the military's Special Operations forces have increased counterterrorism missions against some of the most lethal groups in Afghanistan and, because of their success, plan an even bigger expansion next year, according to American commanders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commandos, from the Army's Delta Force and the Navy's classified Seals units, have had success weakening the network of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the strongest Taliban warrior in eastern Afghanistan, the officers said. Mr. Haqqani's group has used its bases in neighboring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to carry out deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in and around Kabul, the Afghan capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guided by intercepted cellphone communications, the American commandos have also killed some important Taliban operatives in Marja, the most fearsome Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province in the south, the officers said. Marine commanders say they believe that there are some 1,000 fighters holed up in the town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although President Obama and his top aides have not publicly discussed these highly classified missions as part of the administration's revamped strategy for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the counterterrorism operations are expected to increase, along with the deployment of 30,000 more American forces in the next year. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increased counterterrorism operations over the past three or four months reflect growth in every part of the Afghanistan campaign, including conventional forces securing the population, other troops training and partnering with Afghan security forces, and more civilians to complement and capitalize on security gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American commanders in Afghanistan rely on the commando units to carry out some of the most complicated operations against militant leaders, and the missions are never publicly acknowledged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commandos  are the same elite forces that have been pursuing Osama bin Laden, captured Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003 and led the hunt that ended in 2006 in the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader in Iraq of the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent interviews here, commanders explained that the special-mission units from the Joint Special Operations Command were playing a pivotal role in hurting some of the toughest militant groups, and buying some time before American reinforcements arrived and more Afghan security forces could be trained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are extremely effective in the areas where we are focused,'' said one American general in Afghanistan about the commandos, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the classified status of the missions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. David H. Petraeus, who is in charge of the military's Central Command, mentioned the increased focus on counterterrorism operations in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Dec. 9. But he spoke more obliquely about the teams actually conducting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against hard-core Taliban extremists, particularly those in rural areas outside the reach of population centers that conventional forces will focus on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We actually will be increasing our counterterrorist component of the overall strategy,'' General Petraeus told lawmakers. ''There's no question you've got to kill or capture those bad guys that are not reconcilable. And we are intending to do that, and we will have additional national mission force elements to do that when the spring rolls around.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior military officials say it is not surprising that the commandos are playing such an important role in the fight, particularly because Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the senior American and NATO officer in Afghanistan, led the Joint Special Operations Command for five years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the classified American commando missions, military officials say that other NATO special operations forces have teamed up with Afghan counterparts to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban bomb-making networks and other militant cells. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About six weeks ago, allied and Afghan special operations forces killed about 150 Taliban fighters in several villages near Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan, a senior NATO military official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some missions have killed Taliban fighters while searching for Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, who was reported missing on June 30 in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban in July posted a video on jihadist Web sites in which the soldier identified himself and said that he had been captured when he lagged behind on a patrol. A second video was released on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've been hitting them hard, but I want to be careful not to overstate our progress,'' said the NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to describe the operations in detail. ''It has not yet been decisive.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Helmand, more than 10,000 Marines, as well as Afghan and British forces, are gearing up for a major confrontation in Marja early next year. Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, the senior Marine commander in the south, said in a recent interview, ''The overt message we're putting out is, Marja is next.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Nicholson said there were both ''kinetic and nonkinetic shaping operations'' under way. In military parlance that means covert operations, including stealthy commando raids against specific targets, as well as an overt propaganda campaign intended to persuade some Taliban fighters to defect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials say the commandos are mindful of General McChrystal's directive earlier this year to take additional steps to prevent civilian casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February, before General McChrystal was named to his current position, the head of the Joint Special Operations Command, Vice Adm. William H. McRaven, ordered a halt to most commando missions in Afghanistan, reflecting a growing concern that civilian deaths caused by American firepower were jeopardizing broader goals there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The halt, which lasted about two weeks, came after a series of nighttime raids by Special Operations troops killed women and children, and after months of mounting outrage in Afghanistan about civilians killed in air and ground </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order covered all commando missions except those against the top leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, military officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where American commandos are not permitted to operate, the Central Intelligence Agency has stepped up its missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on groups like the Haqqani network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But an official with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or I.S.I., said there had also been more than 60 joint operations involving the I.S.I. and the C.I.A. in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Baluchistan in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official said the missions included ''snatch and grabs'' -- the abduction of important militants -- as well as efforts to kill leaders. These operations were based on intelligence provided by either the United States or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be used against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can expect to see more U.S. action against Haqqani,'' a senior American diplomat in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a recent interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increasing tempo of commando operations in Afghanistan has caused some strains with other American commanders. Many of the top Special Operations forces, as well as intelligence analysts and surveillance aircraft, are being moved to Afghanistan from Iraq, as the Iraq war begins to wind down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's caused some tensions over resources,'' said Lt. Gen. Charles H. Jacoby Jr., the second-ranking  commander in Iraq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ravaged parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this weekend and highlighted the multiple security challenges confronting the embattled Islamabad government, from violent vendettas by Taliban militants to sectarian violence against minority Shiites.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bloodiest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> happened Sunday in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir in the north of the country, where a suicide bomber killed at least 10 people and wounded more than 80 during a Shiite religious procession. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have been worse, the local authorities said: the bomber had been trying to enter a prayer hall but blew himself up when guards blocked him. Pakistani troops were rushed in to restore order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than a dozen people were wounded in Karachi the day before by a small bomb. Both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared directed at Shiites observing Ashura, which commemorates the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in A.D. 680.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The identities of the attackers were not clear, but the country's Shiites, one-fifth of the population, continue to be the targets of Sunni extremists. Past Shiite holidays have been singled out by sectarian militants, leading Pakistani security forces to deploy tens of thousands to protect Ashura marchers this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Kashmir </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed the assassination on Sunday of a mid-level political administrator named Sarfaraz Khan and his family in the Kurram tribal area near the Afghan border. Taliban militants detonated a bomb at Mr. Khan's home, killing him, his wife and four of his children, the local authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be retribution for the Pakistani military's bombing and helicopter strafing of Taliban hide-outs in Kurram and the neighboring tribal area, Orakzai, a stronghold of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, whose fighters seized control of Orakzai last year and instituted strict Islamic laws. One of his wives is also from Orakzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taliban fighters took positions in Kurram and Orakzai after fleeing a Pakistani offensive in the South Waziristan tribal area this fall, Pakistani intelligence and military officials say. Skirmishes are now routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a telephone interview, a Pakistani security official said that Pakistani jets killed six Orakzai militants during a bombing run on Sunday while Taliban guerrillas battled state-sponsored Lashkar tribal militiamen in southern Orakzai. Nine Taliban militants and eight militiamen have died so far in that battle, which was still happening late Sunday, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The South Waziristan offensive prompted Taliban commanders to intensify </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in large cities and in the country's interior. The military says it is throwing resources into killing militants who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> population centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Pakistani officials have refused American demands to drive out militants in North Waziristan, including networks controlled by Sirajuddin Haqqani, who are battling American troops across the border in Afghanistan. Such action is seen as crucial to President Obama's recent order to send 30,000 additional American troops into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American forces are using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and powerful missiles to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> those militants. The death toll for the latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which occurred Saturday evening, has soared to 13, the Pakistani security official and a Pakistani intelligence officer said in interviews on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Saidgai village in North Waziristan, killed seven foreign militants and six local fighters, the Pakistani security official said. Two missiles struck the compound of a man known as Asmatullah, he said. The intelligence official confirmed the number of dead at 13 but said he did not know their identities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM FALK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Falk is the editor in chief of The Week magazine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 31</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">896 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OVER the past year, Americans have spent an average of 11.8 hours a day consuming information, sucking up, in aggregate, 3.6 zettabytes of data and 10,845 trillion words. That, said the University of California, San Diego, researcher who computed these figures, is triple the amount of ''content'' that we consumed in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks to this gargantuan download from all forms of media, we now know vastly more than we did a year ago about bankers' bonuses, Sarah Palin, ''death panels,'' Glenn Beck, where Barack Obama was born, Jon and Kate, and cocktail waitresses who have spent quality time with Tiger Woods.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hidden among that avalanche of diverting gigabytes were some developments of more enduring significance. Here are just a few: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ROBOTIC WARFARE The use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became a central part of the American antiterrorism strategy this year, with President Obama sanctioning about 50 Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- more than George W. Bush approved in his entire second term. As Jane Mayer of The New Yorker reported earlier this year, most of the targets of these assassinations were in the tribal regions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with as many as 500 people killed. Those killed in the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> include many high-ranking Qaeda and Taliban figures and dozens of women and children who lived with them or happened to be nearby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military is so enthusiastic about these remotely piloted planes that it is building new ones as fast as it can (including a more heavily armed version called the Reaper). It also announced that it will deploy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to scour the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean for drug smugglers. What's more, the government is now working on ''nano'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the size of a hummingbird, which would be able to pursue targets into homes and buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CAR CRAZY IN CHINA This year, China surpassed the United States as the largest consumer of that iconic American machine -- the automobile. China's emerging middle class has fallen in love with cars, with sales up more than 40 percent over 2008; there are now long waiting lists for the coolest and hottest models, ranging from the Buick LaCrosse to BMWs. Automakers are expected to sell 12.8 million cars and light trucks in China this year -- 2.5 million more than in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  China's auto boom, of course, has major implications for global efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The nation of 1.3 billion is on pace to double its consumption of gasoline and diesel over the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  REAL WORKING WIVES In more than a third of American households, women are now the chief breadwinners. This reversal of traditional roles was accelerated by a brutal two-year recession, in which 75 percent of all jobs lost were held by men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even in homes where both spouses work, one in four wives now earns more than her husband. That's partly because of rising education levels among women, falling salaries in manufacturing and blue-collar jobs and the growing need for both spouses to bring home a paycheck. Wives' earnings, said Kristin Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, have become ''critical to keeping families afloat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A NEW SOURCE OF STEM CELLS Scientists  re-engineered regular skin cells from mice into stem cells that are just as versatile as embryonic stem cells. To demonstrate that these re-engineered adult cells could be used to create any kind of cell in the body, the Chinese research team inserted just a few of them into placental tissue and developed them into healthy mice. ''We have gone from science fiction to reality,'' said Robert Lanza, a cell biologist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If further research on the new technique proves successful, it may create a viable means for scientists to use a patient's own tissue to produce a replacement liver, kidney or other organ -- without the ethical concerns attached to the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. But reprogramming adult cells opens the door to a new ethical problem: a rogue scientist could use the method to create human beings from a few cells scraped from a person's arm. ''All the pieces are there for serious abuse,'' Mr. Lanza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TEEMING WITH PLANETS Astronomers are closing in on identifying distant worlds that may have the right conditions to support life. Techniques for detecting ''exoplanets'' are becoming more sophisticated, and over 400 have been discovered so far -- 30 in October alone. This year brought two particularly intriguing finds. One is Gliese 581d, orbiting a star at a distance that could indicate surface temperatures not so different from Earth's. Astronomers also discovered a ''waterworld'' composed mostly of H2O, which would be a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life if it were just a little farther from its sun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The discovery of Earth-like planets, with water and moderate temperatures, is now so likely that the Vatican held a conference of astrobiologists this year to discuss the theological repercussions of extraterrestrial life. ''If biology is not unique to the Earth, or life elsewhere differs biochemically from our version, or we ever make contact with an intelligent species in the vastness of space, the implications for our self-image will be profound,'' said Chris Impey, a professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Discovering that we have company in the universe, in fact, might open our eyes to what's important on Earth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest killed at least eight American civilians, most of them C.I.A. officers, at a remote base in southeastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to NATO officials and former American intelligence officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the C.I.A. base, Forward Operating Base Chapman, in Khost Province appeared to be the single deadliest episode for the spy agency in the eight years since the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also dealt a significant blow to the often insular, tight-knit organization, which has lost only 90 officers in the line of duty since its founding in 1947. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One former C.I.A. official said that eight agency employees had been killed but cautioned that early reports from the field were often incorrect. The official, who spoke anonymously because the agency had not commented publicly on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the final number of dead could be higher because at least six American civilians were wounded. It was unclear how many of the dead were full-time C.I.A. officers and how many were contract employees. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A C.I.A. spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. Previously, the spy agency has revealed that four of its officers have been killed since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> all of them memorialized with stars carved into a marble wall at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred as the agency has steadily increased its presence in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past year, sometimes sending operatives to remote bases instead of to heavily fortified embassies in Kabul and Islamabad, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent years, the C.I.A. has been at the forefront of American counterterrorism operations in South Asia, launching a steady barrage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda and Taliban operatives in the mountains along the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Khost Province, bordering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has been a prime area for militants with links to the Taliban and Al Qaeda who use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas as a base to stage their insurgency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bases on the border of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gather intelligence in both countries and generally have ready access to local operatives who can move seamlessly across the border. The Khost area has been one of several throughways that Al Qaeda has used since the 1990s to move back and forth between the two countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a large Qaeda camp south of Khost until August 1998, when its inhabitants were forced to move into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the United States, using cruise missiles, bombed the camp in response to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American embassies in East Africa, believed to have been planned by Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American bases in Khost, but rarely, if ever, do suicide bombers make it past a main gate. Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was particularly audacious because the bomber managed to breach a secure base assigned to potentially sensitive operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A NATO official said the bomber managed to elude security and reach an area near the base's gym. It was not clear whether the bomber, who apparently died in the blast, entered the gym. Among other questions raised was whether the bomber worked at the base and had clearance, or if a security slip allowed him to gain entry, and whether other operatives had access to the base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You are always looking at techniques and procedures, and if you think a place is wrapped up tight and then it's not, it's concerning,'' said a NATO official, who spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former C.I.A. official said the agency was in the process Wednesday of notifying family members of the officers killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The names of some of those killed might never be publicly disclosed, because several of the C.I.A. officers may have been working undercover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American bases in Khost, particularly Camp Salerno, one of the largest in the country, have been the targets of frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dozens of Afghan laborers have been killed in bombings over the past several years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In May, a suicide attacker exploded a car bomb near the main gate, killing 7 civilians and wounding 21. The bombing took place a day after a coordinated Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside the city of Khost, the provincial capital, that left at least 7 civilians and 8 insurgents dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In June, a man riding a motorcycle detonated explosives near a densely crowded intersection in the city, killing 7 Afghan civilians and wounding 44, including 7 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, heavily armed insurgents entered a police headquarters in Gardez, to the north of Khost, and battled Afghan and American security forces for more than three hours. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was attributed to the Taliban network run by Sirajuddin Haqqani, which bases itself just south in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal area of North Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent weeks, American officials have stepped up pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to root out the Haqqani network, whose fighters pose one of the greatest threats to American forces and hold sway over large parts of Afghanistan, including Paktika, Paktia and Khost Provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials and diplomats have said the demand was rebuffed by the Pakistani military, which is already fighting Taliban militants who threaten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government and which has long considered the Haqqanis assets to influence the future shape of Afghanistan once the Americans leave the region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't take long for an Al Qaeda branch, this time in Yemen, to crow about its role in the attempt to blow up Northwest Flight 253. The alleged bomber, meanwhile, told American authorities that he had gone to Yemen to get the explosive device and for training. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If there is any good news here, it is that the Obama administration -- which shockingly missed a series of warnings about the plot -- has been paying close attention to Yemen and, in recent months, has stepped up covert operations against Al Qaeda forces there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington is providing $70 million over the next 18 months to equip and train Yemeni security forces for counterterrorist operations. And it has provided targeting intelligence and additional firepower -- possibly cruise missiles and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Al Qaeda bases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yemen's government is corrupt and repressive. But President Ali Abdullah Saleh seems to want to cooperate -- so long as Washington keeps a low profile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration is now looking at ways to deepen military and intelligence cooperation with Yemen's government even more. But the country is foundering in so many ways that it may be on the verge of collapse. That means the United States and its allies are going to have to devise a broader strategy that also addresses Yemen's desperate economic, political and social problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The government's control does not extend much beyond the capital, Sana, and it faces an armed insurgency in the north and a separatist movement in the south. As the poorest country in the region, Yemen has an unemployment rate of 40 percent and a population that will double by 2035. Experts predict that it will soon run out of oil (its major revenue-producer) and water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If these problems are not dealt with, there can be no hope of defeating Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials say that for several months they have been working on an economic development plan for Yemen with Saudi Arabia, Europe, the World Bank and others and expect to hold a meeting in six weeks to agree on a framework. They need to speed up the process. They should encourage mediation, where possible, between the government and its adversaries and urge and help underwrite reform of a prison system that helps breed jihadists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yemen? Americans have a right to feel weary. But the Christmas Day plot is a warning -- we hope in time -- of why it's so important to head off full chaos in Yemen. The last thing the world needs is another haven for Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of seven Central Intelligence Agency operatives at a remote base in the mountains of Afghanistan are a pointed example of the civilian spy agency's transformation in recent years into a paramilitary organization at the vanguard of America's far-flung wars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as the C.I.A. expands its role in Afghanistan, it is also playing a greater role in quasi-military operations elsewhere, using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to launch a steady barrage of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and sending more operatives to Yemen to assist local officials in their attempts to roll back Al Qaeda's momentum in that country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. operatives stationed at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost Province, where Wednesday's suicide bombing occurred, were responsible for collecting information about militant networks in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and plotting missions to kill the networks' top leaders. In recent months, American officials said, C.I.A. officers at the base had begun an aggressive campaign against a radical group run by Sirajuddin Haqqani, which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of dozens of American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the past year, the C.I.A. has built up an archipelago of firebases in southern and eastern Afghanistan, moving agency operatives out of the embassy in Kabul and closer to their targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the push to the front lines carries great risk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1983 in Beirut, it took a car bomb loaded with 2,000 pounds of explosives to kill eight C.I.A. officers stationed at the heavily fortified American Embassy in the city. In Khost on Wednesday, all it took was one man bent on martyrdom to slip into a remote base and inflict a similar toll on the spy agency's relatively small work force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among those killed, officials said, was the chief of the Khost base, who was a mother of three and a veteran of the agency's clandestine branch. Besides the seven C.I.A. operatives who died, the blast also wounded six agency employees, according to a C.I.A. statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Current and former intelligence officials said Thursday that early evidence indicated that the bomber, in Afghan military fatigues, might have been taken onto the base as a possible informant and might not have been subjected to rigorous screening. But details about the episode remained murky, and a NATO official said the bomber had managed to elude security and reach an area near the base's gym. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C.I.A. personnel regularly take foreign agents onto the base before sending them on intelligence collection missions in eastern Afghanistan and across the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said one Pentagon consultant who works closely with the C.I.A. in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You must to some degree make yourself known to people you don't trust,'' said one American intelligence official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss classified information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber appears to have worn an explosives-laden suicide vest under an Afghan National Army uniform, two NATO officials said Thursday. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> happened close to dusk, when some people at the base were relaxing before dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement to the C.I.A.'s work force, President Obama said that the spy agency had been ''tested as never before,'' and that C.I.A. operatives had ''served on the front lines in directly confronting the dangers of the 21st century.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Forward Operating Base Chapman sits in an isolated spot several miles from the town of Khost, but not far from Camp Salerno, a larger base used by Special Operations troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said that the C.I.A. base had been a focal point for counterterrorism operations against the Haqqani network, a particularly lethal militant group that operates on both sides of the Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Those guys have recently been on a big Haqqani binge,'' said the Pentagon consultant. ''I would be really shocked if the bombing on Wednesday wasn't some kind of retaliation.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was an air of defiance among intelligence officials on the day after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and some spoke of their fallen comrades using military language. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no pullout,'' the American intelligence official said. ''There is no withdrawal or anything like that planned.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. has always had a paramilitary branch known as the Special Activities Division, which secretly engaged in the kinds of operations more routinely carried out by Special Operations troops. But the branch was a small -- and seldom used -- part of its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That changed after Sept. 11, 2001, when President George W. Bush gave the agency expanded authority to capture or kill Qaeda operatives around the world. Since then, Washington has relied much more on the Special Activities Division because battling suspected terrorists does not involve fighting other armies. Rather, it involves secretly moving in and out of countries like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Somalia where the American military is not legally allowed to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fact that the agency is in effect running a war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the culmination of one of the most significant shifts in the C.I.A.'s history. But the agency has at times struggled with this new role. It established a network of secret overseas jails where terrorist suspects were  subjected to brutal interrogation techniques, and it set up an assassination program that at one point was outsourced to employees of a private security company, then known as Blackwater USA. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some longtime agency officers bristled at what they saw as the militarization of the C.I.A., worrying that it was straying too far from its historical missions of espionage and intelligence analysis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he took office in January, President Obama scaled back the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism mission, but only to a point. He ordered that C.I.A. prisons be shut and that C.I.A officers no longer play a role in interrogating suspects accused of terrorist acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the administration has accelerated the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, using Predator and Reaper aircraft to launch missiles and rockets against  militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In early 2009, the White House approved a C.I.A. plan to expand the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Baluchistan, where top leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban militia are thought to be hiding. The agency has also recently begun sending more operatives into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to, among other things, gather target intelligence for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Afghan and Pakistani Taliban groups claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing this week that killed eight Americans -- seven of them C.I.A. officers -- suggesting that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was viewed as a success and could be used to gain recruits and financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The competing claims, made Thursday and Friday, did little to clarify the circumstances of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as each group offered a different account of how the C.I.A. base in Khost Province, in southeastern Afghanistan, had been infiltrated on Wednesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan Taliban said the suicide bomber was a disillusioned Afghan National Army soldier, supporting accounts from NATO officials that the attacker was wearing a uniform over his suicide vest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban said the attacker was someone the C.I.A. had recruited to work with them, who then offered the militants his services as a double agent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. is in the midst of an investigation into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but officials in Washington said this week that the bomber had been brought onto the base because he was being groomed to be an informer for the spy agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a fact of espionage that you frequently have to deal with people you need but don't or can't trust,'' an intelligence official said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. and other American officials have otherwise offered few details publicly about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Forward Operating Base Chapman, about three miles southeast of Khost city, the provincial capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bombing, which claimed the base's chief among its victims, was the most devastating for the C.I.A. since the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which placed the intelligence agency at the front line of the United States efforts in the region to battle the Taliban and root out its allies in Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Khost Province borders </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, a stronghold of both the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban, which share the same language and Pashtun heritage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. base was used for counterterrorism operations on both sides of the border, and one of its missions was to gather intelligence for the spy agency's campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban rely in part on money from foreign donors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that kill members of the international coalition make the groups seem successful and prompt donors to believe that their support is buying results and to send more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As long as the Taliban is perceived as winning, there's a large extremist community out there that will send money to the poor, so to speak,'' said a NATO official with knowledge of Taliban tactics who requested anonymity while discussing security matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan Defense Ministry denied that the bomber had been one of its soldiers, saying that it had no units in that area. And the statement by the intelligence official appeared to rule out that possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban account described the bomber as a ''C.I.A. agent,'' probably meaning an informer, who had contacted Pakistani Taliban commanders and said he was willing to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Americans on the militants' behalf, according to an interview with a Pakistani Taliban leader by The Associated Press in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Thank God that we then trained him and sent him to the Khost air base,'' the news agency quoted Qari Hussain, a Pakistani Taliban commander, as saying. ''The one who was their own man, he succeeded in getting his target.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A service member from the United States died of non-battle-related injuries in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday, according to a statement from NATO.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, Iraq, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan dominated American military and foreign policy. Which themes emerged over the last year? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Iraq, 2009 was the year of relatively smooth transitions. Despite catastrophic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, October and December, and a continuing level of violence that keeps it a troubled place by normal standards, the year went reasonably well in statistical terms. Violence did not increase, even as United States forces left the cities and generally reduced their role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 2009 was the year of the offensives. The country was still very turbulent, but major government military initiatives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan reflected a new determination against the Pakistani Taliban. Unfortunately, the Taliban responded in its own brutal way with an intensification of suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against civilians, killing hundreds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But momentum may be shifting to the government's side -- helped by successful American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against top Taliban and Qaeda leaders. That said, in terms of the basic strength of its economy and society, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is far from out of the woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, 2009 was the year of decisions -- by President Obama, of course, by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and by the Afghan people as they re-elected Hamid Karzai as president. Afghanistan had a bloody year, with more than 300 Americans and some 500 international troops, as well as more than 1,000 Afghan security personnel, losing their lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, as General McChrystal noted in recent Congressional testimony following President Obama's decision to raise troop levels in Afghanistan, our operations have begun to change the momentum in parts of the country -- though this momentum is bound to be halting, as last week's horrific suicide bombing at a United States base made painfully clear. In the year ahead, the hope is that this fragile progress will continue, and that President Karzai will justify American   support by accelerating his efforts to reform the Afghan police force and to root out corruption. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component,'' Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me in November. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot ''seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance.'' Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said last fall that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would send a debilitating message to the world. ''If something happens on the podium and there's chaos,'' this official told me, ''that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The threat seemed to weigh on Obama. He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House. David Axelrod, his senior adviser, later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot. ''He seemed more subdued than he had been,'' Axelrod told me not long ago. Obama had not yet taken office, and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency. No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate, it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security -- and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself, his wife and their two daughters. ''It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into,'' Axelrod said. ''But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats, it's a very sobering moment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years. His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration. The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it. The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration -- Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, James Jones and their colleagues on the other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton immediately put her finger on the problem. According to participants, she asked, what should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall? ''Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address?'' she asked. ''I don't think so.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among those in the room was Robert Gates, who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama. After the meeting, everyone eventually agreed that Gates should stay away from the inauguration in a secret location. With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate, Gates -- an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief -- was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan, a former C.I.A. officer. A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush, Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration. He had wanted to be C.I.A. director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order, so instead he was made deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he helped manage the inaugural threat, culling reports and coordinating between two administrations, Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists. If it is now Obama's war, Brennan is his general. And the first battle set the tone. ''It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing, on the eve of the inauguration,'' Brennan told me in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic ''poison pen,'' when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals, and he was right. In this case, officials familiar with the situation said, some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans. In the end, what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a fledgling president, the incident would be a lesson in the fluid, murky nature of terrorism. The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not, tracking down where threats begin, figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence. The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barack Obama was inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism. He inherited two struggles -- one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that divides his own country over issues like torture, prosecutions, security and what it means to be an American. The first has proved to be complicated and daunting. The second makes the first look easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the last 12 months. Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years, depending on who is talking. In fact, the new president, during his first year, has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office, a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept. 11, 2001. He did, however, shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama, then, found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable, splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology. Where Bush saw black and white, Obama sees gray. Where Bush favored swagger, Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect. Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism, Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them -- even without attacking again -- to alter the nature of American society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda, Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror, as Bush's was. He has given few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article. Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time, Obama rejects the phrase ''war on terror'' altogether, hoping to recast the struggle as one of a number of vital challenges confronting America. The nation is at war with Al Qaeda, Obama says, but not with terrorism, which, as he understands it, is a tactic, not an enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism -- you know, are you with us or against us, black and white, this global war on terror,'' John Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless, low-ceilinged, soundproof office in the West Wing, where mobile phones are banned. ''It was almost all-consuming. It was the driving force for our foreign policies, that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror.'' That attitude, Brennan went on to say, proved counterproductive. ''This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda,'' he said. ''But at the same time, what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the ''mood music'' -- choice of language, outreach to Muslims, rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration. He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells, aides said, but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism. ''If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year, he would put Cairo in the top three,'' Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The policies themselves, though, have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest. ''The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration,'' Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, ''but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency, neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago, when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel, concrete and bodies. Yet that mood can change in a hurry, as the Christmas Day plot showed. Obama understands that, if only by the law of averages, there is a decent chance of a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States during his presidency. And if that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> happens, any change in policy, no matter how incidental to the facts of the case, will be fodder for critics to blame him for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month, a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president. If Bush's system was broken, they asked, why didn't Obama fix it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself -- how he reacted, how he spoke, how he led. Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan, who was back in Washington, it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public, and when he did, he was typically cool and cerebral, with none of Bush's bring-it-on, dead-or-alive rhetoric. Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, or that Reid was charged in civilian court, not as an enemy combatant; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war. Bush felt it in his gut. Obama thinks about it in his head. If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened, wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people? Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information? Yet with the country afraid, is it possible to overthink it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You've got almost two extremes,'' Henry Crumpton, who led the C.I.A.'s operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush, told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt. ''You've got Bush 43, who aspired to have a warrior's ethos. He was driven, I think, by that, and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions, Iraq being the most horrible extreme. Obama comes at it from the other extreme. He comes at it like a lawyer would, someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos. And it is a war. You've got guys out there who want to kill us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama was a state senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania. He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio. ''By the time I arrived at my meeting,'' he wrote in his book ''The Audacity of Hope,'' ''the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose, but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept. 11. As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring of 2007, when he was a presidential candidate, Obama met Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security. The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings. ''When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch, he was finishing the sentences,'' Clarke told me. ''I'd like to think it was because he read my book, but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book. He'd talked with a lot of people. He'd read a lot about it. And he had a real understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser, and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to. His advisers told him he had a choice: he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security, Democrats also have hairy chests, as one put it, or he could develop a new paradigm. Obama, typically, found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing, although he threw in a vow to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> terrorists in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even, if necessary, without permission of its government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is time to turn the page,'' he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007. He said that ''America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil; we are not at war with Islam.'' He criticized claims of ''unchecked presidential power'' and vowed ''to close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions.'' He said ''that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens, no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime'' and ''no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he won the presidency more than a year later, he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world. The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in. They confronted him with the dark side, as Cheney once put it. ''The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table,'' Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change, appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle. ''Mr. President-elect, we're doing things very well, but we're losing the messaging war,'' Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told him a week after the election, according to an official informed about the session. A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world, Leiter maintained. ''You have an opportunity to change that message, to change how the struggle is perceived,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama was receptive to that mandate. ''We're going to do that,'' he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president, Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day. ''That's mostly what they talked about,'' a senior Bush adviser told me. ''I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level, but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times. Yet for all the cooperation, Obama chose to make one of his first acts a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Bush legacy, signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel, Greg Craig, that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guantanamo closed within a year. The move generated debate about timing and tactics. John Podesta, who ran Obama's transition, agreed with the policy but argued against making Guantanamo the first priority right after inauguration, according to colleagues. Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism. ''The language we use matters,'' he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office. So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration. ''War on terror'' was out; so were ''Islamofascism'' and ''evildoers.'' The new language did not always go over well. While testifying to Congress a year ago, Napolitano used the phrase ''man-caused disasters,'' and though she said ''terrorism'' elsewhere in her remarks, she drew wide scorn. (''I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate,'' she later told me. ''It was just a mistake. In the editing process, that phrase, usually it's'terrorism or other man-caused disasters.' '')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Brennan, who has emerged as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy, is solidly built, with a weathered face and close-cropped, retreating hair. His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room, studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives. He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily. He is a serious man in a serious business, a career man, a survivor, someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed. And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A native of North Bergen, N.J., Brennan, who is 54, attended Catholic schools, all the way through Fordham University. After his freshman year, he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there, and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview, he developed a case of youthful wanderlust. He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While reading The New York Times on a bus one day, he saw a C.I.A. recruitment ad and decided to apply. When I asked why, he gave one of those answers that sounds as if it came from an espionage novel. ''Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth,'' he said of the nation's first spy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the C.I.A., Brennan rose through the ranks, becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s, a time of rising Islamic terrorism. Just months before he arrived in Riyadh, terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex, killing 19 American service members. During his tour, they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. A favorite of George J. Tenet, the C.I.A. director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush, Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Sept. 11, Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director. But his steady rise reached a peak. When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center, bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror, he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job. Brennan, unhappy, left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled, ''Mr. President, You're Wrong on Iraq.'' In keeping with C.I.A. rules, he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication. A copy found its way to the White House, where it angered top officials. Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C.I.A. review, but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House. ''He was dead to them,'' says a friend and fellow senior official, who did not want to be named discussing internal matters. An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House. Obama presented another chance. ''This is redemption,'' the friend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C.I.A. briefer in the Clinton White House, was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007. Obama grew to like Brennan's precise, matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C.I.A. director. But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man, a C.I.A. careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror, rankled Obama supporters on the left. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stephen Soldz, a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists. The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's ''Frontline,'' in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing. ''We know, of course, that'the appropriate Department of Justice review' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government,'' Soldz's letter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions. ''There was a real debate within the agency, including today, about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go, because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use,'' he told PBS. ''We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, human rights advocates have a point about continuity. For all his talk of change, Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place. Besides Brennan, there is Gates still atop the Pentagon, as well as Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush, and Michael Vickers, still the assistant Defense secretary for special operations. While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C.I.A., he kept the deputy director, Stephen Kappes, along with Leiter, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan, but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer, Gen. David Petraeus, and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Bush's Iraq war czar, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. To manage the effort to close Guantanamo, Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried. The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey, and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of those people, of course, were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration, not the Cheney cadre, or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years. ''I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding,'' Brennan told me. ''I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program. But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with.'' For instance, he offered, ''if you grab somebody by the lapels, and you say, Oh, my goodness, you've violated their rights as a person, well, I'm not going to go that far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time and circumstances have changed as well. ''Four years ago, I would have said -- and I did say -- the agency's detention program needed to continue,'' Brennan said, referring to the secret ''black site'' overseas prisons ran by the C.I.A. ''There have been a lot of developments and changes, so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago, because of the changed conditions, because of a new administration, whatever, I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all. I've changed my views.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job. But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz. ''I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama,'' he said. ''And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under. So I'm having these battles inside myself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several weeks after Obama took office, I sat down with the president, along with three colleagues from The Times, in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio. Now that he was in office, we asked what, if anything, he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The candidate who denounced the ''color-coded politics of fear'' and rejected policies that ''compromised our most precious values'' was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time. He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9/11 and where we were by the time I took office,'' he told us. ''I think the C.I.A., for example, and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention, took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency, and when Obama took office, the course he set was more about accelerating that evolution than about restarting it. Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings, Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power. Two years before leaving office, he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor, even a Democrat, would not feel compelled to reverse direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time Obama was inaugurated, waterboarding had been halted for years, Bush had ordered that the secret C.I.A. black site prisons be emptied and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress. Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guantanamo prison, and although he never managed to do so, his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama built on those actions. While setting a one-year deadline to close Guantanamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor, he left the surveillance program intact, embraced the Patriot Act, retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets. He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign, albeit with more due-process safeguards. He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely. And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part, they were comfortable with Obama's policies, although they were reluctant to say so on the record. Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did, while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course. And they generally resent Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and are unwilling to give him political cover by defending him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under Bush, was willing to say publicly what others would not. ''There is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration,'' Hayden told me. James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter. ''I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite,'' he said. ''It's Bush. It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric. You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not every Bush veteran agrees, of course. Marc Thiessen, a former White House speechwriter, has a new book called, ''Courting Disaster: How the C.I.A. Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary, told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama, Washington had ''lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism.'' Most disturbing to the Bush camp, even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies, have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A., to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C.I.A. officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-declared mastermind of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to New York to face trial in civilian court. Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser, last spring not to alienate the C.I.A. by dredging up the past. ''You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service,'' Hayden recalled saying. ''If these guys don't think you have their back, they're not going to be very adventurous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is ample historical precedent for this cycle. During times of national crisis, Washington often claims more authority, sometimes to the point of excess, then slowly cedes it back, from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another. ''Historically the more we move away from a crisis, the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing, and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance,'' says Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bush says he sees another historical pattern. In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign, he predicted that if a Democrat won, he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman. Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office, Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place. Of course, this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that, like Truman, he will look better in the eyes of history. A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity, arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation. But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stone, who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school, says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States. ''He may feel in fact,'' Stone says, ''that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was, that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stone joined a group of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention. Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty, arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision to close the Guantanamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress, even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states. An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed. Obama authorized the release of the memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned, but he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Brennan, these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush. But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times. When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C.I.A. interrogation methods, Brennan initially agreed, reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned anyway. But he later reversed himself and sided with the C.I.A., which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work. Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington, and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation. Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel, who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room, Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues. Everyone in the room raised hard questions, voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters. Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U. ''Look, you're the only politician I've ever believed in,'' Romero said, according to people in the room. ''When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York, I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you. But this stuff really pains me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama pushed back, explaining the constraints he was under. It was a balancing act, he said; he had multiple obligations. Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guantanamo, those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release. ''He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options,'' says Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I talked with Romero later, he would not describe his interaction with Obama, but he expressed his frustration. While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies, Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the ''hubris'' of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely. ''He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did,'' Romero told me. ''If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one worries about what he'll do when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges. Just a few years earlier, he wrote in his book that ''when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial,'' then ''we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes.'' Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention. Romero and the A.C.L.U. began preparing a campaign against the proposed legislation if he went forward, soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu, trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics. But then the administration reversed course; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era, it would not enshrine the power in law, and signaled that it would not use it for future cases. ''We were gearing up for the battle of our lives,'' Romero said. ''Fortunately, they turned back from the abyss.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Brennan said Obama ''is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach,'' one that would be more ''multidimensional'' without letting terrorism define American foreign policy. Among other things, he emphasized the ''upstream factors,'' meaning the conditions that fuel extremism, and vowed to promote ''a political, economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people -- security for their communities, education for children, a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But something else was happening inside the White House. Some in the West Wing, like Emanuel, worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York. Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department, but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call. Still, by the end of the year, the activists' favorite ally in the West Wing, Greg Craig, was out. He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror, some that he won and others that he lost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House,'' Romero lamented. ''The others either demur or mumble.'' Craig's ouster, he added, was ''unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the house that John Brennan built, about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to, at least as much as they can. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins. Obama came to visit last fall, and Brennan accompanied him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from ''24,'' the Fox television show, with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms -- C.I.A., F.B.I., D.O.D., N.S.A., D.I.A., D.H.S., D.N.I., T.S.A. and so on -- sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos, intercepted telephone calls, satellite imagery, reports from the field, news accounts and myriad other ''intelligence streams,'' as they are known. A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN. Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world. Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This place was supposed to help stop the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since Sept. 11, NCTC and various government agencies have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last few months alone, the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States. But the cliche is right -- the government has to be right 100 percent of the time, while the other side needs to succeed only once. And the system failed to pull together what its component parts knew about Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's critics about whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism. But he has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists. With information processed at NCTC and elsewhere, Obama has authorized the C.I.A. to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Critics complain that such ''targeted assassinations'' are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed. Obama had a searching conversation with Brennan and Denis McDonough, Catholics who oppose the death penalty, about whether to keep the program. ''He was wrestling with it,'' says one adviser. But in the end, there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program. At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president, according to a participant, Obama said pointedly, ''The C.I.A. gets what it needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. has launched 53 such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Obama's first year in office, more than during Bush's entire presidency, according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation. In part, that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties. And in part, it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there; when the Obama administration came into office, it learned that dozens of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up, according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program. Obama has authorized doubling the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Pakistani border area, as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the course of Obama's first year in office, his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have taken out a number of ''high-value targets,'' including Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban; Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; and Tahir Yuldashev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of Al Qaeda. At the same time, according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann, the civilian death rate of those killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008. Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower. ''I don't hear anyone inside the government, including people like me who came from outside, who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential,'' says a senior Obama counterterrorism official. ''There are a lot of negatives, but it is completely essential.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well. When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel, in southern Somalia, officials debated three options, including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country, several officials told me. Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him instead with a plan for an airstrike, which he approved. Weather on the day of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prompted a change in plans, and commanders instead authorized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters to sweep into Somalia. Nabhan was killed. American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen, the poor, unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from. Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together. It is a breeding ground for extremism, the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and, the president has stated, the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. At the same time, it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo come from, making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there. Obama has ordered more training, equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government; about $70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces, doubling previous spending, and last week the administration announced it would double it again next year. Last month the American government also provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts. Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen like the one in Saudi Arabia that American officials say they believe has been largely successful in transitioning former Guantanamo detainees back into society -- although some have joined up with Al Qaeda nonetheless. And by the time Brennan returned from his most recent trip, many of his colleagues had despaired of ever finding a safe way to repatriate the nearly 100 Yemenis still at Guantanamo. That was before Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama was singing Christmas carols with his family at a house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit. The president got on the phone with Brennan, who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals secreted in his underwear, only to have passengers and crew jump him. Soon enough, Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notwithstanding Janet Napolitano's statement last month that ''the system worked,'' Obama suspected that it had not. While on vacation he was given an 80-page review of the Fort Hood shooting, looking at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government. The night after his first statement, his advisers learned that the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning. He was simmering. ''Let me make this very clear to you,'' he told the advisers, according to two of them. ''While I understand intelligence is hard, and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence, what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared.'' After hanging up with Brennan, aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media. Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What's the deal?'' Obama asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm just about done,'' McDonough said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, just move over.'' Obama sat down and finished it himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's statement that there was a ''systemic failure'' did not quell the political furor, and White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism. After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists, David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, who revised it and posted on the White House Web site. The criticism got Brennan's back up too, particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about,'' he told me after the Christmas Day attempt. Some Republicans, including Cheney, were blatantly mischaracterizing the record, he fumed. ''When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda, that is just complete hogwash.'' It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations. ''What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort, which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident. ''I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately,'' Brennan told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber, some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists. In recent months, authorities have arrested a number of American residents, including Najibullah Zazi, an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York after receiving training in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai. There was the Fort Hood shooting rampage, as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supposedly to join the jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If they are the next wave, American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop. The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado. ''Although no one wants to admit it, I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States,'' Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism scholar, told me. ''It's way different than it was in the Bush years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it. In October, Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to look for holes to close. Napolitano told me: ''We can't operate in the paradigm that if they </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> us, they would be coming from other countries into the United States. We have some that are homegrown. That is a change.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all the lawyerly focus on Guantanamo and the rules of war, the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief. It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month, he declared that ''evil does exist in the world.'' His press secretary, Robert Gibbs, went on the Sunday shows after the Christmas Day plot and, consciously or not, used the term ''war on terror.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows, the first such foray for the C.I.A. veteran. In his first radio and Internet address of the new year, Obama implicitly rebutted Cheney by noting that he used the word ''war'' is his inaugural address. ''Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred,'' Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The war goes on, abroad and at home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American missiles, presumably fired by  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, struck twice Wednesday in North Waziristan, the Pakistani tribal region that is a stronghold of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were the deadliest reported since Dec. 30, when a double agent detonated a suicide vest packed with explosives and killed eight people at a Central Intelligence Agency base in southeastern Afghanistan. The C.I.A. base served as an important part of the American effort, which included </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to single out Al Qaeda's top leadership in the region. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missiles hit along the border with Afghanistan's Paktika Province, in a part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is a base for the Taliban network run by Sirajuddin Haqqani. His network works closely with Al Qaeda and runs part of the insurgency against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Details of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the remote area remained sketchy and the death tolls varied, but a government official said as many as 20 or 25 people might have been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A resident of Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan, said by telephone that the initial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred in the village of Sanzalai, in a mountainous region about 22 miles west. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just when people gathered at the scene to retrieve the bodies and pull out the wounded, another missile struck an hour later,'' the resident said. The second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left five dead and wounded another three, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that the area was under the control of local militants and that those killed in the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be ''guests,'' a term used for foreign militants or Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior government official in Peshawar, capital of neighboring North-West Frontier Province, said that 17 people were killed but acknowledged that details remained unclear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another official said that the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a base frequented by foreign fighters, and that about two dozen people had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters,  said foreign militants were among the dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has stepped up the pace and intensity of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, carrying out more than 40 last year in a C.I.A. program that is ostensibly covert but is  widely known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere, at least 4 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 11 wounded in what the authorities said might have been a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place Wednesday  in Tarar Khal, part of the Rawalakot District, along the border with India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no claim of responsibility, and Pakistani Army officials did not comment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Militant groups, supported by the army and intelligence services, have for years used Pakistani-controlled Kashmir as a staging ground for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to challenge Indian forces on the other side of the line that divides the disputed Himalayan region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until recently, they rarely, if ever, struck at Pakistani government forces in Kashmir, even as  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increased across other parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the third in the area in three months, local politicians said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think this is the first time that we have found that terrorists have a network in Kashmir,'' said Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, a former prime minister of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir and now a member of its legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seem to be an extension of what is happening in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Chaudhry said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fall of 2001, as an anguished nation came to grips with the Sept. 11 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a slender, soft-spoken economics major named Elizabeth Hanson set out to write her senior thesis at Colby College in Maine. Her question was a timely one: How do the world's three major faith traditions apply economic principles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Hanson's report, ''Faithless Heathens: Scriptural Economics of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,'' carried a title far more provocative than its contents, said the professor who advised her. But it may have given a hint of her career to come, as an officer for the Central Intelligence Agency specializing in hunting down Islamic extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That career was cut short last week: Ms. Hanson was one of seven Americans killed in a suicide bombing at a C.I.A. base in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the days since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> details of the lives of the victims -- five men and two women, including two C.I.A. contractors from the firm formerly known as Blackwater -- have begun to trickle out, despite the secretive nature of their work. What emerges is a rare public glimpse of a closed society, a peek into one sliver of the spy agency as it operates more than eight years after the C.I.A. was pushed to the front lines of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their deaths were a significant blow to the agency, crippling a team responsible for collecting information about militant networks in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and plotting missions to kill the networks' top leaders. And in one sign of how the once male-dominated bastion of the C.I.A. has changed in recent years, the suicide bombing revealed that a woman had been in charge of the base that was attacked, Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, the operational leader of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan issued a statement praising the work of the suicide bomber, Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, and said that the Khost bombing, which also killed a Jordanian intelligence operative, was revenge for the killings of a number of top militant leaders in C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He detonated his fine, astonishing and well-designed explosive device, which was unseen by the eyes of those who do not believe in the hereafter,'' said the statement from the Qaeda leader, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, which was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those who died came from all corners of the United States but were thrown together in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. Several had military backgrounds. One of the fallen C.I.A. employees, a security officer named Scott Roberson, had worked undercover as a narcotics detective in the Atlanta Police Department, according to an obituary, and spent time in Kosovo for the United Nations. Postings on an online memorial site describe a hard-charging motorcyclist with a remarkable recall of episodes of ''The Benny Hill Show.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another, Harold Brown Jr., was a former Army reservist and father of three who had traveled home from Afghanistan briefly in July to help his family move into a new home in the Northern Virginia suburbs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown's mother, Barbara, said in an interview that her son -- she had believed he worked for the State Department -- had intended to spend a year in Afghanistan, returning home in April. He did not relish the work, she said, and talked little about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The people there just want to live their lives. They're normal people,'' she recalled him saying, adding that he had told her parts of Afghanistan were ''just like back in biblical times.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The base chief, an agency veteran, had traveled to Afghanistan last year as part of the C.I.A.'s effort to augment its ranks in the war zone. After consulting with the C.I.A., The New York Times is withholding some identifying information about the woman. The agency declined to comment about the identities of any of the employees. Some of the names were disclosed by family members. Ms. Hanson's name was first reported in The Daily Beast, an online magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a telephone interview, her father, Duane Hanson Jr., said an agency official called several days ago to let him know that his daughter, who he said would have turned 31 next month, had been killed. He knew little of her work, other than that she had been in Afghanistan. ''I begged her not to go,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Do you know how dangerous that is? That's for soldiers.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other woman killed, the chief of the Khost base, was, before the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> part of a small cadre of counterterrorism officers focused on the growth of Al Qaeda and charged with finding Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Working from a small office near C.I.A. headquarters, the group, known inside the agency as Alec Station, became increasingly alarmed in the summer of 2001 that a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was coming. One former officer recalls that the woman had a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of Al Qaeda's top leadership and was so familiar with the different permutations of the leaders' names that she could take fragments of intelligence and build them into a mosaic of Al Qaeda's operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She was one of the first people in the agency to tackle Al Qaeda in a serious way,'' said the former officer, who, like some others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the victims' identities remain classified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was not the only veteran Qaeda expert killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One victim, whose name has not been disclosed, was one of the C.I.A.'s most knowledgeable analysts about the terrorist network, according to a retired senior agency official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two of the dead, Jeremy Wise, 35, a former member of the Navy Seals from Virginia Beach, Va., and Dane Clark Paresi, 46, of Dupont, Wash., were security officers for Xe Services, the firm formerly known as Blackwater. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company did not respond to a request for comment about the deaths, but they have been widely reported in local newspapers. The Jeremy Wise Memorial on Facebook had 3,189 fans on Tuesday, filled with recollections of Mr. Wise's childhood   as the son of a doctor in Arkansas; his parents currently live in Hope, Bill Clinton's hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''RIP, Jeremy Wise, American hero,'' one wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The suicide bomber has been identified as a Jordanian double agent who was taken onto the base to meet with American officials who thought he was an informant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a message to the C.I.A. work force after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama told agency employees that ''your triumphs and even your names may be unknown to your fellow Americans.'' And indeed, some relatives and friends of the dead did not seem to know of their agency connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Hanson's economics professor, Michael Donihue, said he was shocked to discover her career path. At Colby, from which she graduated in 2002, she paired her   economics major with a minor in Russian language and literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She was a thoughtful person; she had an intellectual curiosity that I really liked,'' Professor Donihue said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials in Afghanistan and Washington said the C.I.A. group in Khost had been particularly aggressive in recent months against the Haqqani network, a militant group that has claimed responsibility for dozens of American deaths in Afghanistan. One NATO official in Afghanistan spoke in stark terms about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying it had ''effectively shut down a key station.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These were not people who wrote things down in the computer or in notebooks. It was all in their heads,'' he said. The C.I.A. is ''pulling in new people from all over the world, but how long will it take to rebuild the networks, to get up to speed? Lots of it is irrecoverable. Lots of it.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A house in Karachi where militants appeared to have been storing ammunition for terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was destroyed in a deadly explosion early Friday morning, police officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seven people were killed in the blast, which rocked the working-class neighborhood of Baldia on the western edge of Karachi. Amid the rubble, the police and rescue workers found a large cache of weapons, including suicide vests, automatic rifles and grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Karachi, the financial and commercial capital of the country, has largely been spared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and suicide bombings that have hit much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including in Islamabad, Peshawar and Lahore. Those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have intensified since the government began offensives last year against militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Karachi was shaken late last month, when a suicide bomber killed more than 30 people during a Shiite religious procession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Friday, missiles, presumably fired by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, continued to hit targets in North Waziristan, near the Afghan border. Local news media reported that at least three people were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that flattened a house in the Tappai area of North Waziristan, a stronghold of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator John McCain, a member of an American Congressional delegation meeting Friday with senior Pakistani officials in Islamabad, defended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which are extremely unpopular among residents here because they also have caused unintended civilian deaths. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have fueled broad anti-American sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, said during a news conference that the airstrikes were necessary because the militants were using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I understand very well that there are elements operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that, if allowed to do so, would go to Afghanistan and kill Americans and destroy the government and re-establish Afghanistan as a base for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States and our allies,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has stepped up the pace and intensity of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, carrying out more than 40 last year in a C.I.A. program that is ostensibly covert but is widely known and generally accepted by the Pakistani government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the blast in Karachi, the police said they had detained six people, including a woman, for questioning, and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani ordered an immediate inquiry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Waseem Ahmad, the Karachi police chief, said the suspects appeared to have been planning a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the city, although he provided no details to support the claim. He also did not say why he thought only a single </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was planned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police said they believed that the explosion might have occurred when the group was handling the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those killed in the blast were all said to be in their early 20s, heightening speculation that they were would-be suicide bombers. Pakistani security officials have said that most of the suicide bombers in recent terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been young men and teenage boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials did not say whether the occupants of the home had been linked to any militant groups, but Rehman Malik, the  interior minister, said they came from the Swat Valley, where the government conducted a major military offensive last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik, who was in Karachi on Friday, said the occupants had been renting the one-story house for two months. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A house in Karachi where militants appeared to have been storing ammunition for terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was destroyed in a deadly explosion early Friday morning, police officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seven people were killed in the blast, which rocked the working-class neighborhood of Baldia on the western edge of Karachi. Amid the rubble, the police and rescue workers found a large cache of weapons, including suicide vests, automatic rifles and grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karachi, the financial and commercial capital of the country, has largely been spared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and suicide bombings that have hit much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including in Islamabad, Peshawar and Lahore. Those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have intensified since the government began offensives last year against militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Karachi was shaken late last month, when a suicide bomber killed more than 30 people during a Shiite religious procession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Friday, missiles, presumably fired by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, continued to hit targets in North Waziristan, near the Afghan border. Local news media reported that at least three people were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that flattened a house in the Tappai area of North Waziristan, a stronghold of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator John McCain, a member of an American Congressional delegation meeting Friday with senior Pakistani officials in Islamabad, defended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which are extremely unpopular among residents here because they also have caused unintended civilian deaths. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have fueled broad anti-American sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, said during a news conference that the airstrikes were necessary because the militants were using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I understand very well that there are elements operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that, if allowed to do so, would go to Afghanistan and kill Americans and destroy the government and re-establish Afghanistan as a base for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States and our allies,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has stepped up the pace and intensity of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, carrying out more than 40 last year in a C.I.A. program that is ostensibly covert but is widely known and generally accepted by the Pakistani government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the blast in Karachi, the police said they had detained six people, including a woman, for questioning, and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani ordered an immediate inquiry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Waseem Ahmad, the Karachi police chief, said the suspects appeared to have been planning a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the city, although he provided no details to support the claim. He also did not say why he thought only a single </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was planned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police said they believed the explosion might have occurred when the group was handling the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those killed in the blast were all said to be in their early 20s, heightening speculation that they were would-be suicide bombers. Pakistani security officials have said that most of the suicide bombers in recent terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been young men and teenage boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials did not say whether the occupants of the home had been linked to any militant groups, but Rehman Malik, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interior minister, said they came from the Swat Valley, where the government conducted a major military offensive last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik, who was in Karachi on Friday, said the occupants had been renting the one-story house for two months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Karachi, a sprawling southern port city of 18 million, has a history of ethnic and sectarian violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Shiite religious procession last month set off rioting in parts of the city and prompted fears that predominantly Sunni Muslim extremist groups were now trying to foment sectarian violence against the country's minority Shiites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the third against Shiites in three days, appeared to deeply unsettle the Pakistani government, which ordered a paramilitary force under the control of the Interior Ministry to take control of Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The local news media have recently suggested that Taliban militants might have embedded themselves in some of the city's slums, especially the predominantly Pashtun neighborhoods. One of those districts is Baldia, where Friday's blast occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One reason Karachi is thought to have been spared before, analysts and police officials say, is that the city has long been used as a financing and regrouping base by local and foreign militants, who would prefer not to lose this sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This seems to be changing,'' said Arif Rafiq, a political analyst. ''Broadly, what we have in Karachi is the intersection of conflicts between coalition partners in the provincial and federal governments, the president and the army, and the Taliban and the Pakistani military. It's certainly possible that the Pakistani Taliban is trying to up the ante by making </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial capital and largest city bleed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, Mr. Malik, apparently in an attempt to calm fears, also announced that all illegal immigrants, especially Afghans, should leave Karachi within 30 days. But there are an estimated 1.6 million to 2 million illegal immigrants in Karachi, and it is unclear whether the government can enforce the mandate, particularly against the many Afghans in the city; some are believed to be jihadis while others left their country to escape the war there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts say the vast majority of militants in the city are Pakistanis, so forcing Afghans to leave would not make the city safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The escalation of violence in Karachi has political undertones as well. For several weeks, tensions have festered over the killings of workers for the Muttahida Quami Movement, the political party that controls the city, and supporters of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party. The two parties, which are ideologically similar, appear to be vying for control of the city. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Updated | 4:15 p.m. As my colleague Stephen Farrell reports on Saturday, the Jordanian suicide bomber who killed eight intelligence officers at a C.I.A. base in Afghanistan last month apparently recorded a martyrdom video before his death, in which he said that his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was an act of revenge for the assassination of the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video was broadcast by Al Jazeera and is featured in this report on the satellite channel's English-language Web site:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Al Jazeera and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AAJ TV the man sitting next to the bomber, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, in the video is Hakimullah Mehsud, the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been widely reported that Mr. Balawi started his militant career as a blogger, writing posts on jihadist Web sites and forums under the pen name Abu Dujana al-Khorasani. Jarret Brachman, the author of &quot;Global Jihadism: Theory and Practice&quot; and a consultant to the United States government on terrorism, wrote a post on his blog on Wednesday, called &quot;On Jihadist Punditry: Part 1,&quot; looking at Mr. Balawi's writing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brachman wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few Americans have ever heard of Al-Qaida pundits like Abu Dujana al-Khorasani. [...] Curiously, however, the writings by these al-Qaida pundits are becoming the glue that holds al-Qaida's internet movement together.  Think of your favorite Sunday morning talk show. First, you've got the big policy heavyweight interview.  In al-Qaida's case, it's an As-Sahab video featuring, say, an interview with Ayman al-Zawahiri or Abu Yahya al-Libi.  After the heavyweight spouts their talking points for the day, what happens on the Sunday shows?  They bring out the roundtable panel of commentators and pundits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These pundits try to dissect, parse, interpret and analyze what the heavyweight said. They vary in terms of their style, sophistication, tone, viewpoint, etc..  Al-Qaida's version of the Sunday morning talk-shows are these jihadist pundits.  They are essayists. Much like the early American writers who issued their revolutionary treatises in the form of these short, cogent, provocative written pamphlets who became known as pamphleteers, the jihadist authors use the same approach, just via the internet, to peddle their ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brachman explained that, under his pen name Abu Dujana, Mr. Balawi's writing &quot;put him on par with the most influential jihadist pundits operating on the forums.&quot; While like-minded &quot;jihobbyists,&quot; as Mr. Brachman calls jihadist bloggers, reportedly saw intellect and wit in Mr. Balawi's posts, he apparently laced his writing with a very dark kind of humor. Mr. Brachman wrote that the Jordanian relied &quot;heavily on exaggeration, rhetorical games, ad hominem </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and bravado.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of Mr. Balawi's essays made available to The Lede by Mr. Brachman make it plain that the Jordanian blogger was well-acquainted with American culture and American efforts to use the Internet to track militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ode to the legendary (or mythic) Iraqi Islamist leader Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, Mr. Balawi wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West hates Al-Baghdadi because they used to seeing a Muslim youth putting a picture of Rambo on his shirt and a picture of Beckham on his copybook, shaking his head to pop and rock music, enjoying imported art in the paintings of Pablo Picasso, reading the plays of Shakespeare, eating McDonald's, smoking Marlboros and shaving his hair like the Marines </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They used to see a Muslim splitting from his culture, snooping on others' goods and not carrying any of Islam's values. But after the principality of Abu Omar Al-Baghdadi the world will be liberated from Western civilization, Islamic culture will spread on the entire earth and Islamic instructions will be like a fashion for non-Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the expansion of the Islamic map [...] Barbie will dress in the niqab [full-face veil] and will read the Koran when you touch it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another essay, Mr. Balawi mocked the frustrated efforts of intelligence offficers, like those he would go on to kill, trying to locate Osama bin Laden, writing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine hundreds of people... some of them wearing suits and sitting behind desks,<BR>Some of them wearing Afghan clothes and spying among the mujahedeen,<BR>Some of them sitting every day for long hours trying to analyze radios waves and mobile phones,<BR>Some of them studying thousands of e-mail messages every day trying to reach even a small thing,<BR>Some of them collecting information sent through satellites,<BR>Intelligent, experts, scientists, managers... Americans, Arabs, Afghans, Pakistanis, all looking for him without finding him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Update | 4:15 p.m. My colleague Stephen Farrell has posted a short video interview with Mr. Balawi's father, conducted on Saturday in Amman, Jordan, after Al Jazeera broadcast the martyrdom video of his son. Mr. Farrell writes that &quot;Shortly after the video screened on Al Jazeera, Mr. Balawi's father came to the door of his home in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and amid sighs and some tears, confirmed that it showed his son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elder Mr. Balawi told Mr. Farrell that his son was transformed into &quot;a different person&quot; after he was detained by Jordanian intelligence before deciding to travel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;Had they left him, he would have stayed behind his computer forever -- he would only be expressing his opinion, only talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, the Jordanian suicide bomber who killed eight people at a Central Intelligence Agency outpost in Afghanistan last month, was shown in a video on Saturday saying that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out in revenge for the 2009 killing of the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Balawi, wearing green camouflage fatigues and carrying a weapon in his lap, appeared in a video on Al Jazeera satellite television denouncing his ''enemies,'' Jordan and America. Mr. Balawi's father, Khalil, confirmed that the man in the video was his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was shown sitting beside another man, whom a Pakistani news report identified as Hakimullah Mehsud, the aggressive young militant who took the reins of the Pakistani Taliban after Baitullah Mehsud's death and has spearheaded an intense string of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That image, and Mr. Balawi's praise for Baitullah Mehsud, seemed to support the Pakistani Taliban's claims that they were the main player in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and had trained Mr. Balawi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But other militants allied with Afghan Taliban factions and Al Qaeda claimed responsibility, too, suggesting another  possibility: that all those militant groups are cooperating more than ever. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the heart of American concerns in the region and has led to increased tension with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the Obama administration pushes its government to go after Afghan and Pakistani extremist factions on its soil in addition to Mr. Mehsud's network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Balawi, a doctor of Palestinian origin who had worked in a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, blew himself up on Dec. 30 at a C.I.A. base in Khost, in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. American officials have described him as a double agent who was taken onto the base in Afghanistan because the C.I.A. hoped he might be able to deliver top members of Al Qaeda's network, according to Western government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video was the latest glimpse into the last days of a man who intelligence officials believe had worked in a calculated and patient way for at least a year to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a major blow against American operations, carefully cultivating intelligence contacts with the claim that he could be of help against Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Washington, the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department had no comment about the video. Paula Weiss, a C.I.A spokeswoman, said in reaction to the video that ''the United States is looking into every aspect of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after the video appeared on Al Jazeera, Mr. Balawi's father came to the door of his home in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and amid sighs and some tears, confirmed that it showed his son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My heart is tearing apart,'' he said. ''Who is the one who destroyed the one that I brought up? Who is the one who turned him from a human doctor to someone who carries out such a thing?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he said, he was not astonished by what his son had done. ''We are not surprised,'' he said. ''Fighting the arrogant, unjust, haughty and tyrant American who kills civilians and innocent people makes the whole Islamic world hate America.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He continued: ''They say that Jesus gave his life to people. I say that Humam sacrificed his body and soul for the oppressed.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One theme that has been consistent in the family's comments since Mr. Balawi's identity emerged was that he became a changed man after he was detained a year ago by the Jordanian authorities during the Israeli offensive in Gaza and was questioned over his jihadi Web site writings. Gaza and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict featured those Internet writings, said a Jordanian analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Jordanian authorities released Mr. Balawi after three days, and he disappeared shortly afterward to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to his wife and Jordanian officials. The Jordanian government maintains that it was in fact Mr. Balawi who later contacted them from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by e-mail, offering intelligence on Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Growing impassioned while speaking to a reporter on Saturday, Khalil al-Balawi harshly criticized intelligence officials for his son's change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I blame the agencies that recruited him, and changed him,'' he said. ''Changed him. They turned him from a human, a doctor, to a person with a heart full of negative and hostile emotions toward others.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to killing seven Americans at the outpost, Mr. Balawi's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed a Jordanian intelligence officer and distant relative of King Abdullah II named Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid. It is thought that he was Mr. Balawi's Jordanian handler and was taking Mr. Balawi to a meeting of American intelligence officials at the base, Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an op-ed article in The Washington Post this weekend, Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, rebuffed criticism of his agency, describing the vengeance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as proof that intelligence missions were taking a toll against militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was not a question of trusting a potential intelligence asset,'' he wrote, saying that Mr. Balawi had been stopped and searched outside the outpost when he set off his explosives. ''It is never that simple, and no one ignored the hazards.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In October, two months after the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed Baitullah Mehsud, his Taliban fighters fled their sanctuary in the South Waziristan tribal area during a Pakistani military offensive into the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was soon clear that the Mehsud fighters, rallying around Hakimullah Mehsud, had escaped to nearby tribal areas to fight another day, and in the past three months more than 600 people have been killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> generally depicted as retribution for the offensive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The surge in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- coming as President Obama ordered 30,000 more troops into neighboring Afghanistan -- has also sharpened tensions between the Pakistani and American governments. Pakistani officials maintain that their military has the capacity to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only Pakistani Taliban militants -- Mr. Mehsud's faction -- who are intent on striking the country's security forces and population centers. But the Americans have been pushing them to drive out militants in the North Waziristan tribal area, including Al Qaeda and the Taliban faction led by the Afghan militant Sirajuddin Haqqani, which focuses on attacking troops in Afghanistan. The Americans view that operation as a critical part of the troop escalation in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Haqqanis, too, control much of the area of eastern Afghanistan where the bombing took place, leading to a continuing American belief that they and Al Qaeda were at least complicit in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many analysts agree that the militant factions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are working together more closely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general, said that in addition to involvement by Hakimullah Mehsud's network, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the C.I.A. station in Khost most likely involved some elements of Al Qaeda and other Taliban factions. Al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban groups have also claimed responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would say the Taliban and Al Qaeda were both parties, because they get support from each other,'' Mr. Masood said, adding that there was a ''deep nexus'' between the groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American intelligence official, reacting to the claims of responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from multiple militant groups, said: ''It's worth remembering that terrorist groups in this part of the world swim in the same swamp. There are connections among them. They're essentially scorpionsin a bottle.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials may seize on the video to help bolster their arguments that the greatest threat is posed not by the Haqqani networks but by Pakistani Taliban fighters under Mr. Mehsud's direction. Yet one Pakistani official feared that the video could also be employed as an argument to expand the C.I.A.'s program of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Is this going to be used to prove a point?'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Jazeera's Web site said that the video was released to the news organization on Saturday. It bears the date Dec. 20 -- 10 days before the bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In it, Mr. Balawi said: ''This is a message to the enemies of the nation: to the Jordanian intelligence and the American Central Intelligence Agency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The same theme was taken up by Mr. Balawi's father, who said: ''Had he killed innocent civilians I would have denounced him. He dealt with the worst people of wickedness and he killed them, and they killed him. This is a war of intelligence agencies. There is winning and there is losing. Thank God Almighty.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS I reflect on disturbing events of recent weeks -- the massacre of seven C.I.A. officers in Khost, Afghanistan, and the near bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on its way to Detroit -- I can see in my mind's eye a young man. He is Middle Eastern, with a thin, mustachioed face and pallid skin, and he stands nervously in the middle of a very public square, unnoticed amid a swirling crowd. Glancing furtively at his watch, he begins to walk, as he was instructed, along a prescribed route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another young man, an American who is a C.I.A. case officer, has already circled the square, shielded by the passers-by. He is alert to anything out of place, to someone loitering near a motorcycle, to a group of men sitting aimlessly in a car, to anyone who may be paying attention to his source. He is dressed to look like any other dark-haired male of no particular account in this dusty and obscure third-world city in the 1980s. Under the officer's sweater is a crude bulletproof vest, giving him the barrel-chested look of a wrestler. The vest is of limited protection, but a partial insurance against faults of judgment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case officer begins to follow his source at a discreet distance. He knows the young man well, or believes he does. His assessment, upon which his life may depend, is that the source, though a member of a terrorist organization and willing to put his life at risk to meet an American spy, is a physical coward. Personal loyalty is important to him, as is his relationship with the American, from which he hopes to benefit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Circumstances can change, however, and with them, motivations. In a world of fear and desperation, today's friend can become tomorrow's deadly enemy. The case officer is confident that while the source could perhaps find the opportunity to shoot him, he lacks the courage ever to do it himself. While this lack of fortitude may be a blessing, it could easily lead him, if discovered and placed under pressure, to guide others to their American target, to do what he himself could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Satisfied at length that no one is watching the source, the case officer suddenly approaches him from behind, grabs him by the elbow and pulls him abruptly down a cobblestone alley, in a direction the source could not have anticipated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this case, the officer's faith is rewarded. The Middle Easterner becomes a valuable asset. But the case officer is not always so fortunate. A year later, in a different city, he has just inherited a new source. Working against the government of a state sponsor of terrorism, the source is what is referred to in the business as a ''principal agent,'' running his own network of subordinate spies. With the case officer's encouragement, the principal agent has managed to lure a potential subagent -- a childhood friend he considers closer than a brother -- out from the police state where he lives. They hold a series of meetings during which the principal agent vets his friend, assesses him and formally recruits him into the network, all under the watchful guidance of the case officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As I look back at that young case officer poised at that moment in time, I wish I could speak with him now. I wish I could remind him that his own confidence, his ambition and his desire for success are in fact his worst enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the story concerning that principal agent we will never know. We will never know precisely why one day, in setting up another meeting with his old friend, he ignored his training. He had been told -- hadn't he? -- that he must never allow himself to fall into a pattern, that he must never be predictable. And his case officer, in spite of endless soul-searching, would never know whether any of the myriad things he might have done differently would have saved a brave man whom he had sworn to protect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What we do know is that one evening, the principal agent and his boyhood pal, now his betrayer, had dinner at a shabby seaside restaurant; that they sat at the same table they had occupied the night before; that a group of four men in a car drove slowly around the block twice; that two of the men entered the restaurant and strolled over in front of the principal agent's table; that each then emptied his pistol into the agent's chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the wake of President Obama's  speech on intelligence last week, there is much soul-searching going on, at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley and elsewhere, about what happened in Khost on Dec. 30. We are told that a Jordanian-born informant betrayed his spymasters and ignited a suicide bomb at a military base, killing those seven C.I.A. employees and wounding at least six more in the greatest blow to American intelligence in two decades. It comes as a cold slap in the face, but one that implicates us all. For these men and women, like the uniformed troops they serve alongside, have assumed great risks, and they have assumed them to keep the rest of us safe at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the wildly divergent news accounts attest, none of us on the outside knows what really happened. But this hasn't stopped the armchair geniuses who dispense grave platitudes on the enormity of the mistakes made, or the ''former officials'' who preen for reporters, spouting revelations regarding international intelligence relationships that, if true, are best not spoken of at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There may well have been some element of human error or incaution. Young operatives might have allowed their desire to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a blow against America's enemies to override their professional caution. (As perhaps I did myself so many years ago.) Or, perhaps, having weighed the risks and gains of the alternatives, the officers simply came up short. In the wilderness of mirrors that defines human intelligence in counterterrorism, the threat of disaster is an inescapable presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for the grace of God, my colleagues and I could have come up similarly short on any number of occasions  in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan during the run-up to 9/11 and the resulting American-led invasion. Brave young men and women met in wild and obscure places with dubious characters; had they not done so, we would not have had the human information network that was vital in routing Al Qaeda and the Taliban so quickly in 2001.   Some flew on helicopters deep into Taliban-controlled areas to meet with tribal leaders whom we felt we could trust, but whose followers might have had the means and motivation to murder my colleagues. We fully expected to lose many of our people in those days. That our losses were light in the end was a testament to their courage, their professionalism and, yes, their luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The importance of the human intelligence work done by officers like those we lost at Khost is only increasing over time. The growing sophistication of our enemies, as they react to the grievous losses they have suffered, makes us all the more reliant on human spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To outsiders, the counterterrorism struggle along the Pakistani-Afghan border can seem antiseptic -- a war of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of terrorists who simply disappear in a puff of smoke. But make no mistake: the intelligence-led struggle fought in our name is, at its core, every bit as gritty and as visceral as conventional combat. But in this war, you come to know your enemies as well as your friends, and the battlefield encompasses the full scope of human character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trainees who aspire to join the National Clandestine Service, the undercover arm of the C.I.A., get careful instruction. They are instilled with a proper regard for their mission, for the laws they must follow, for the sacred obligation to sources, and for their duty to one another. Much stress is placed on loyalty. Loyalty can take many forms, but when all is said and done, loyalty is essentially tribal. That is as true for us as it is for any Afghan. C.I.A. officers undertake risks not for any ideology, but to protect Americans from those who would want only kill them. At a time when calamity is a poignant reminder of the loyalty displayed by C.I.A. officers toward us, we might reflect on what we owe them in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet over the past two weeks, we have watched the unedifying spectacle of politicians and bureaucrats, mired in a Washington environment defined by political fear, posturing shamelessly over the would-be airline bomber. A wealthy nation that refuses to invest sufficiently in available technology, or to put up with travel delays necessary to see whether passengers are carrying explosives onto airplanes, chooses instead to excoriate the intelligence community for failing to see unerringly into the minds and hearts of men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rather than admit to the hard fact that we must always rely on someone's subjective assessment of tolerable risk, politicians are vilifying those who put together our terrorism watch lists, who are simply following threat protocols. Meanwhile, intelligence analysts who are charged with making subjective judgments as to which of the hundreds of thousands of possible terrorists lurking in their databases merit their focused scrutiny to ''connect the dots'' are being accused of dereliction for having underestimated the threat from a single African college student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sacrificing intelligence operatives out of political expediency is a bipartisan sport. Officials in the George W. Bush administration did not hesitate to blame the spies when it suited them -- as though the decision to invade Iraq really depended on intelligence -- and the Obama administration is proving, if anything, worse. Last spring's decision to release secret Justice Department memos on the interrogations of suspected terrorists was a blatantly partisan act. It was designed to win political advantage by holding intelligence officers -- whose offense was to follow faithfully their lawful orders -- up to opprobrium and scorn. Members of Congress who had enthusiastically encouraged aggressive interrogations in the wake of 9/11 suddenly suffered amnesia when the political zeitgeist shifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a curious way to reward those who risk everything to defend us. How, in the face of such betrayal, can we expect to bring new generations  into the intelligence ranks? It is possible to reward loyalty with loyalty while still insisting on the highest standards of professionalism from our intelligence officers. Indeed, we can better reinforce excellence in intelligence when we judge it with honesty, realism and a sense of proportion. Politicians will behave dishonorably so long as it benefits them. It is up to the rest of us to tell them, ''Enough.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Like every Democratic president sinceJohn F. Kennedy,President Obama is battling the perception that he's a wimp on national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not just coming from Republicans (for example,Dick Cheney's accusation that Mr. Obama is trying to pretend that the country isn't at war). Now barbs are coming from the center too. This week's Foreign Policy magazine has a provocative cover: Mr. Obama next toJimmy Carter with -- gasp -- an ''equals'' sign in the middle. New York Times/CBS polling  shows that public approval of Mr. Obama's foreign policy dropped 9 points to 50 percent between last April and November. Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on the Daily Beast blog two weeks ago that Mr. Obama needs to toughen up with his adversaries. ''He puts far too much store on being the smartest guy in the room,'' Mr. Gelb wrote. ''He'd do well to remember that Jimmy Carter also rang all the I.Q. bells.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So soon? Here is a president who just ramped up the war in Afghanistan, sending an additional 30,000 American troops. He has stepped up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by unmanned Predators in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and provided intelligence and firepower for two airstrikes against Al Qaeda in Yemen that killed more than 60 militants. He has resisted the temptation to sign a new nuclear arms agreement with Russia that might not provide American inspectors with the level of verification detail that they want. He is moving toward the wide use of full body scans in American airports. On Thursday, in an oblique nod to the Cheney criticism, he even used the phrase ''we are at war,'' in describing the fight against Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, accusations that Democrats are genetically softer on threats to the Republic are nothing new. After World War II, Republicans mostly  stopped attacking the Democrats as the party that had gotten America into two world wars, and began calling it soft on Communism. Roosevelt's agreement to the postwar division of Europe at Yalta, followed by China's fall in 1949 while Truman was president, spurred that on. John Kennedy managed to emerge from an early fiasco at the Bay of Pigs and achieve the counter-image of a cold war liberal, thanks to the Berlin and Cuban-missile crises; thenLyndon Johnson's fear of being labeled ''soft on Communism'' helped him override his doubts about getting deeper into Vietnam. But after that, the ill-fated antiwar candidacy ofGeorge McGovern, followed by Jimmy Carter's inability to rescue American hostages in Iran, sealed a stereotype of Democrats as, well, wimps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And labels count, as a poll taken last August by the Pew Center for the People and the Press  illustrates: When voters were asked  which party could do a better job of dealing with terrorism, they  expressed more confidence in Republicans than in Democrats, as they had consistently since 2002.  The 2009 margin was 38 percent to 32 percent.  But when asked  which party could do a better job of making wise decisions about foreign policy, 44 percent chose the Democrats, 31 percent the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some experts say that the weakling label is more about this city than Mr. Obama -- that every political cycle brings with it the opportunity for pundits and politicians to try to prove they were right all along. ''I think the problem is much less Obama than the audience,'' said George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''This is about talk radio and punditry; these are the absolutes that the bloggers deal with: wimp or macho? This is the new caricature, but it doesn't withstand any analysis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But labels can stick, as Mr. Carter himself found out so well, and as the Republicans also know from their experience parrying the opposite stereotype -- of cowboy-style recklessness, first underRonald Reagan and later underGeorge W. Bush (whose own father, oddly, was said to have suffered from a ''wimp factor'').</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of which raises the question of what, exactly, it is that Mr. Obama has to do by the end of the year to turn around the impression that Democrats are cream puffs on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the White House, 2009 was a year of emphasizing a departure from the blunter foreign policy style of President Bush, of projecting that America could offer an unclenched fist (Iran), push the reset button (Russia) and proclaim that it was moving to a policy that focused not only on guns but also offered butter (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But now, 2010 ''will be about achieving some results there,'' said Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress and a Democrat. ''They're going to need to demonstrate a set of tangible successes that's not just a set of speeches.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those tangible successes include being able to show that the nice-guy act can yield real results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Take Russia, for instance. Mr. Obama needs Russia's agreement to impose stiffer United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran this year, to make worthwhile the 12 months he just spent courting President Dimitri Medvedev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2009, Mr. Obama pledged a new relationship with Russia after several years during which the Bush administration and the Kremlin were at each other's throats over everything from missile defense to Georgia. Mr. Obama removed the thorniest dispute between the two countries when he announced last September that he would scrap plans for missile defense system sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, a central irritant to Russia, in favor of smaller ship-based interceptors that might later be positioned on land in Europe. Russia welcomed the move, with Prime MinisterVladimir Putin going so far as to call it ''correct and brave.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now it's time for some payback. The United States wants the Security Council to endorse tough new sanctions against Iran as part of the international effort to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Russia and China don't like sanctions, and both have dragged their feet before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, Mr. Obama has gotten Mr. Medvedev -- but not China's president,Hu Jintao -- to say publicly that he might be willing to endorse new sanctions. But will Russia and China come through when the time arrives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The biggest vulnerability that he's got is that he said all that stuff about engagement and the outstretched hand, that he looks naive if he discovers that other people don't reciprocate,'' said Stephen Sestanovich, Clinton administration ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet Union who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. But, he added: ''The Chinese and the Russians are more likely to try to let him down easy, to smooth over the disagreement. They like the good relationship they've got now, and there's no payoff for them in trying to humiliate him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, speaking of Iran, this is the year when Mr. Obama must go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde with that country, the experts say. Nobody thinks there's much chance that the Iranian government will suddenly suspend its enrichment of uranium, as Mr. Obama would like. But Mr. Perkovich argues that Mr. Obama has done much to unhinge the government there, by giving the opposition in Iran more of a reason to view the United States with a kinder eye, thanks to Mr. Obama's overtures over the past year. Still, since the president can't depend on the Iranian opposition toppling the government, 2010 is the year he must show he is standing tough to try to contain Iran. Which means harsher Security Council sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there's terrorism. Mr. Obama will also have to demonstrate some tangible action there, the experts say, to dispel the notion put forward by the Republicans that his plans to shut down the detention center at GuantanamoBay, Cuba, makes Americans less safe. The Christmas Day attempted plane </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over Detroit failed in many ways, but it succeeded in doing one thing: reintroducing the issue of terrorism into the American psyche. Now, Mr. Obama is under pressure to show that he considers fighting terrorism to be a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The problem though, is that many of the steps he can take against terrorism -- like intelligence co-operation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and covert actions -- are, by their very nature, often invisible. ''He needs visible victories there, like hits on Al Qaeda leaders, so no one is able to put together a narrative that says he's weak,'' said David J. Rothkopf, a Clinton administration official and author of ''Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. Obama, that may also mean talking tough more often, Mr. Rothkopf said. ''If you're going to be president of the United States in the early part of the 21st century, you're going to have to look like you're tough on terror.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the military rushes to place more spy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over Afghanistan, the remote-controlled planes are producing so much video intelligence that analysts are finding it more and more difficult to keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Air Force </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collected nearly three times as much video over Afghanistan and Iraq last year as in 2007 -- about 24 years' worth if watched continuously. That volume is expected to multiply in the coming years as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are added to the fleet and as some start using multiple cameras to shoot in many directions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A group of young analysts already watches every second of the footage live as it is streamed to Langley Air Force Base here and to other intelligence centers, and they quickly pass warnings about insurgents and roadside bombs to troops in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But military officials also see much potential in using the archives of video collected by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for later analysis, like searching for patterns of insurgent activity over time. To date, only a small fraction of the stored video has been retrieved for such intelligence purposes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Government agencies are still having trouble making sense of the flood of data they collect for intelligence purposes, a point underscored by the 9/11 Commission and, more recently, by President Obama after the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound passenger flight on Christmas Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mindful of those lapses, the Air Force and other military units are trying to prevent an overload of video collected by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and they are turning to the television industry to learn how to quickly share video clips and display a mix of data in ways that make analysis faster and easier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They are even testing some of the splashier techniques used by broadcasters, like the telestrator that John Madden popularized for scrawling football plays. It could be used to warn troops about a threatening vehicle or to circle a compound that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Imagine you are tuning in to a football game without all the graphics,'' said Lucius Stone, an executive at Harris Broadcast Communications, a provider of commercial technology that is working with the military. ''You don't know what the score is. You don't know what the down is. It's just raw video. And that's how the guys in the military have been using it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The demand for the Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has surged since the terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2001, and they have become among the most critical weapons for hunting insurgent leaders and protecting allied forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military relies on the video feeds to catch insurgents burying roadside bombs and to find their houses or weapons caches. Most commanders are now reluctant to send a convoy down a road without an armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> watching over it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Army, the Marines and the special forces are also deploying hundreds of smaller surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And the C.I.A. uses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to mount missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Air Force officials, who take the lead in analyzing the video from Iraq and Afghanistan, say they have managed to keep up with the most urgent assignments. And it was clear, on a visit to the analysis center in an old hangar here, that they were often able to correlate the video data with clues in still images and intercepted phone conversations to build a fuller picture of the biggest threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the Obama administration sends more troops to Afghanistan, the task of monitoring the video will become more challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead of carrying just one camera, the Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which are newer and larger than the Predators, will soon be able to record video in 10 directions at once. By 2011, that will increase to 30 directions with plans for as many as 65 after that. Even the Air Force's top intelligence official, Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, says it could soon be ''swimming in sensors and drowning in data.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the Air Force would have to funnel many of those feeds directly to ground troops to keep from overwhelming its intelligence centers. He said the Air Force was working more closely with field commanders to identify the most important targets, and it was adding 2,500 analysts to help handle the growing volume of data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a new $500 million computer system that is being installed now, the Air Force will be able to start using some of the television techniques and to send out automatic alerts when important information comes in, complete with highlight clips and even text and graphics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If automation can provide a cue for our people that would make better use of their time, that would help us significantly,'' said Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Air Force's chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials acknowledge that in many ways, the military is just catching up to features that have long been familiar to users of YouTube and Google. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John R. Peele, a chief in the counterterrorism office at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which helps the Air Force analyze videos, said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''proliferated so quickly, and we didn't have very much experience using them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So we're kind of learning as we go along which tools would be helpful,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mark A. Bigham, an executive at Raytheon, which designed the new computer system, said the Air Force had actually moved more quickly than most intelligence agencies to create Weblike networks where data could be shared easily among analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, it has relayed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> video to the United States and Europe for analysis for more than a decade. The operations, which now include 4,000 airmen, are headquartered at the base here, where three analysts watch the live feed from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One never takes his eyes off the monitor, calling out possible threats to his partners, who immediately pass alerts to the field via computer chat rooms and snap screenshots of the most valuable images. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's mostly through the chat rooms -- that's how we're fighting these days,'' said Col. Daniel R. Johnson, who runs the intelligence centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said other analysts, mostly enlisted men and women in their early 20s, studied the hundreds of still images and phone calls captured each day by U-2s and other planes and sent out follow-up reports melding all the data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bigham, the Raytheon executive, said the new system would help speed that process. He said it would also tag basic data, like the geographic coordinates and the chat room discussions, and alert officials throughout the military who might want to call up the videos for further study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while the biggest timesaver would be to automatically scan the video for trucks and armed men, that software is not yet reliable. And the military has run into the same problem that the broadcast industry has in trying to pick out football players swarming on a tackle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So Cmdr. Joseph A. Smith, a Navy officer assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which sets standards for video intelligence, said he and other officials had climbed into broadcast trucks outside football stadiums to learn how the networks tagged and retrieved highlight film. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are these three guys who sit in the back of an ESPN or Fox Sports van, and every time Tom Brady comes on the screen, they tap a button so that Tom Brady is marked,'' Commander Smith said, referring to the New England Patriots quarterback. Then, to call up the highlights later, he said, ''they just type in: 'Tom Brady, touchdown pass.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lt. Col. Brendan M. Harris, who is in charge of an intelligence squadron here, said his analysts could do that. He said the Air Force had just installed telestrators on its latest hand-held video receiver, and harried officers in the field would soon be able to simply circle the images of trucks or individuals they wanted the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Colonel Harris also said that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often shot gray-toned video with infrared cameras that was harder to decipher than color shots. And when force is potentially involved, he said, there will be limits on what automated systems are allowed to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You need somebody who's trained and is accountable in recognizing that that is a woman, that is a child and that is someone who's carrying a weapon,'' he said. ''And the best tools for that are still the eyeball and the human brain.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A volatile town in southern Afghanistan erupted Tuesday as rumors spread that American servicemen had desecrated a Koran and defiled local women in a nearby village. Taliban provocateurs on the scene whipped up a crowd and goaded it to violence, local officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the riot was over, at least eight protesters were dead and about a dozen wounded, shot by Afghan intelligence officers. Much of the town of Garmsir blamed the Americans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The episode, which American officers said they were investigating, highlighted how easily suspicions and resentment can flare out of control in an area as contested as the Helmand River Valley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thousands of American Marines and soldiers -- the majority of the reinforcements President Obama has sent so far to try to turn the tide of the war -- are moving into areas there that had previously stood as uncontested Taliban strongholds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Kabul, American commanders denied that their service members had engaged in any offensive conduct. But the damage, it seemed, had been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The protest began when several thousand Afghans gathered in the central bazaar in Garmsir, after reports of abuse by American servicemen during a raid at a nearby village two nights before. Local officials said the protest was organized by the Taliban's shadow governor for Garmsir, Mullah Mohammed Naim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban were provoking the people,'' Kamal Khan, Helmand Province's deputy police chief, said in a telephone interview. ''They were telling the people that the Americans and their Afghan partners are killing innocent people, bombing their homes and destroying their mosques and also blaspheming their religion and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban were telling the people, 'This is jihad; you should sacrifice yourselves.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No witnesses to the disputed raid could be located; it took place Sunday night in the village of Darweshan. American officers in Kabul said that Afghan soldiers conducted a nighttime operation in the village, with the Americans in support. But they said that no shots had been fired and that no one had engaged in any inappropriate conduct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The protesters in Garmsir began shouting ''Death to America'' and ''Death to Kamal Khan'' and overturned several cars. They set a school on fire. Then they stormed the local office of the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan domestic intelligence service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The N.D.S. is sometimes blamed for providing faulty intelligence to the Americans, who then detain the wrong people. As the crowd moved in, N.D.S. officers opened fire, Mr. Khan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the 8 protesters killed and 13 wounded, an Afghan intelligence officer and two police officers were killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the chaos unfolded, American officials said, a Taliban sniper began firing into a nearby American base, Forward Operating Base Delhi, a few hundred yards away. American officers said they killed the sniper but no one else. In a statement, the Americans denied that they had fired on any protesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kamal, the deputy police chief, seconded that. ''There were no Americans there,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the episode appeared to have soured relations between the Americans and at least some Afghans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans are blaspheming the holy Koran and violating and disrespecting our culture,'' said Jan Gul, a farmer whose son was killed in the protest. ''We cannot tolerate such behavior. We will defend our religion.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, some Afghans at the demonstration maintained that the American forces were present with the N.D.S. agents and fired on the crowd. But Mr. Khan and American officers in Kabul said that was not true. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While denying these allegations, we take them very seriously and support a combined investigation with local Afghan authorities,'' Maj. Gen. Michael Regner said in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I.S.A.F. is an international force that includes Muslim soldiers, and we deplore such an action under any circumstances,'' he said, using the abbreviation for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least 363 American and other NATO service personnel have been killed in Helmand, more than in any other Afghan province. Helmand received the bulk of the 17,000 additional soldiers Mr. Obama sent to the region after taking office last January, and it will get at least some of the 30,000 reinforcements that he ordered last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garmsir is an especially difficult area. It was under Taliban control until May 2008, when a force of American Marines swept in and cleared the town. Since then, the Marines have been trying to secure the area and establish a government. In fact, they have brought a measure of calm to Garmsir and its environs, an area six miles long and six miles wide. But outside Garmsir -- and sometimes inside it -- the Taliban are still operating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also Tuesday, 16 people suspected of being insurgents were killed in a pair of Hellfire missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched by unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Airstrikes by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have drawn great attention in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where the C.I.A. has used Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the larger Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to find and kill Taliban and Qaeda fighters in the rugged areas along the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, by contrast, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out by the United States Air Force are rarely publicized. In 2002, officials with the C.I.A. used a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fire a missile at a warlord, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, outside Kabul, but missed. Until Monday, there had been very few publicized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Afghan side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, the American command in Kabul said the more lethal of the two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place in Now Zad, where the missile was fired at a group of men moving military equipment. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 13 people suspected of being insurgents, the statement said. An Afghan in the area who was interviewed by telephone said that those killed had in fact been insurgents, and that no civilians had been harmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second missile was fired in the Nad Ali District, killing three insurgents, the command said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In both instances, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired Hellfire missiles. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months, politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march again, targeting the country from within and without, and your hapless government cannot protect you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the enemies on American soil in 2009, rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut, were a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill. The weapons were old-fashioned guns and explosives -- in several cases, duds supplied by F.B.I. informants -- with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons, let alone the nuclear bombs, that have long been the ultimate fear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And though 2009 brought more domestic plots, and more serious plots, than any recent year, their lethality was relatively modest. Exactly 14 of the approximately 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such statistics would be no comfort, of course, if an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with mass casualties succeeded some day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor do they excuse the acknowledged missteps at the United States' bulked-up security agencies that helped allow a makeshift bomb to be carried onto a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines plane on Christmas Day -- the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that set off the flood of news coverage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even that near miss, said Mark M. Lowenthal, assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency for analysis from 2002 to 2005, may offer indirect evidence of the enemy's diminished strength, compared with the coordinated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sending one guy on one plane is a huge step down,'' Mr. Lowenthal said. ''They're less capable, even if they're still lethal. They're not able to carry out the intense planning they once did.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Counterterrorism experts inside and outside the government are intensely debating the meaning of the flurry of plots last year, and there is no settled consensus. Somalia and Yemen have emerged decisively as jihadist hot spots that may pose a direct threat to the United States. C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas have by no means ended the threat from there, as the Dec. 30 suicide bombing that killed seven C.I.A. employees in nearby Afghanistan grimly underscored. The Internet continues to prove a powerful tool for radicalization, as long-distance propagandists stir the ire of young Muslims about American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Lowenthal and others who urge a calmer, more strategic assessment of the recent rash of violent schemes insist that the country is far safer than it was in 2001. They also argue that since the goal of terrorism is to spread terror, hyperbole about threats only does the extremists' work for them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We give comfort to our enemies,'' said Charles E. Allen, a 40-year C.I.A. veteran who served as the top intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security from 2007 to early last year. Exaggerated news coverage and commentary, he said, ''creates an atmosphere of tension and fear, and to me that's exactly the wrong way to go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Allen said the United States needed ''resilience'' in the face of the terrorist threat. He noted with admiration that public transportation barely paused in London in 2005 when 52 people were killed by four suicide bombers attacking the subway and a bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I believe in heightened attention to security; I just don't believe hysteria is useful,'' Mr. Allen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 10 jihadist plots or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside the United States in 2009 -- a count by Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University -- had no evident links to one another and little in common beyond their apparent ideological motive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deadliest was allegedly carried out by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of the Fort Hood shootings, who does not appear to have been directed by any group, though he exchanged e-mail messages with a radical cleric in Yemen. Schemes broken up in Newburgh, N.Y.; Springfield, Ill.; Raleigh, N.C.; Boston; and Dallas seem to have developed independently and largely under surveillance from the F.B.I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More disturbing to counterterrorism officials were two cases with ties to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal region, where Osama bin Laden and the remaining core of Al Qaeda are thought to be hiding. They involved Najibullah Zazi, the former Manhattan coffee vendor accused of traveling to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for explosives training, and David C. Headley of Chicago, who is charged with aiding the 2008 assault on Mumbai and plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Denmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The term ''Al Qaeda,'' used as a catchall in many of the plots, blurs important distinctions. By most accounts, apart from possibly the Zazi case, none of the 2009 cases appears to be directly tied to ''Al Qaeda central,'' as experts refer to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based group led by Mr. bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others involved ersatz ''Qaeda'' agents who actually worked for the F.B.I. Still others, including the Christmas Day attempt, had links to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a loosely linked affiliate of Mr. bin Laden's group in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Audrey Kurth Cronin of the National War College said Qaeda affiliates borrow the name to enhance their appeal but are usually more interested in local goals than in the global jihad proclaimed by Mr. bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The proper response is to stop calling all these plots 'Al Qaeda,' '' Ms. Cronin said. ''We're inadvertently building up the brand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2008, in his book ''Leaderless Jihad,'' Marc Sageman, a psychiatrist and former C.I.A. officer who has long studied terrorism networks, wrote that Al Qaeda was in decline, to be replaced by dispersed terrorists for whom it provided mostly inspiration. The new generation of extremists, he believed, would be less skilled and would likely pose less of a threat than the network responsible for the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Sageman said he saw no reason to revise that judgment today. The plots of the last year should be carefully analyzed and the findings used to improve counterterrorism, not turned into fuel for thoughtless anti-Muslim panic and discrimination, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we overreact and upset 1.5 billion Muslims,'' Dr. Sageman said, referring to the global total, ''then we'll have a lot bigger problem on our hands.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Pakistani civilians killed in militant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose by a third in 2009 over the previous year, according to a new research report, a toll that exceeded even the number of civilian deaths in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report, released this week by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Institute for Peace Studies, an independent research group based in Islamabad that tracks security issues, found that 3,021 Pakistanis were killed in insurgent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 33 percent more than in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A United Nations report released Wednesday said that 2,412 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in 2009, attributing most of those deaths to militant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The higher toll in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was driven by a surge of suicide bombings by militants against civilian targets, including mosques, a university and public markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Ministry said the number of deaths totaled 1,674, lower than the institute's count. But the institute's director, Muhammad Amir Rana, argued that his group's data was more comprehensive, drawing on local media reports, which its employees double check, as well as official sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Militants carried out 87 suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2009, up from 63 the previous year, according to the institute. The bombings, which tend to inflict harm over a wide area, also helped account for a 60 percent rise in injuries, to 7,334. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The institute began issuing the reports in 2006, Mr. Rana said, to give a clearer picture of militancy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Since then, the number of Pakistanis killed in militant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has more than tripled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long had problems with violence, including sectarian fighting throughout the 1990s, it was not until after the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States that major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began to intensify. In 2005, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increased significantly, and have risen every year since, with their numbers doubling between 2005 and 2007, Mr. Rana said. The overwhelming majority of the suicide bombings last year were in North-West Frontier Province, a populous area that borders Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, where the militants are strong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a countertrend, there was a drop in bombings from militants in tribal areas, where the military has begun an operation against them  -- 7, compared with 16 the previous year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Punjab, the most populous province and the military and political heart of the country, suffered 15 suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the second-highest number in the country, up from 8 in 2008, but far below the 52 that militants conducted in North-West Frontier Province. Punjab, ethnically distinct from the border regions in the mountainous west, had been relatively untouched by violence until recently. The surge in bombings last year shocked Pakistanis and helped turn public opinion and media coverage against the Taliban, though anger at the government and the United States also spiked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The number of sectarian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jumped by 86 percent compared with 2008, according to the report, with the highest concentration in Dera Ismail Khan, a city in North-West Frontier Province whose Shiite minority has been made a target by militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In all, researchers counted 12,632 deaths from violence in 2009, of which about half were deaths associated with the Pakistani military's campaigns against Taliban militants throughout 2009. The military keeps specific tallies of its own dead, though militant casualties are more difficult to track and are often based on estimates and not body counts in the field. Battlefields are rarely accessible to journalists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also included in the tally were 667 people -- mostly civilians -- killed in American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the report said. An additional 2,000 were killed in nonmilitant violence, including political violence and tribal fighting. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A volatile town in southern Afghanistan erupted Tuesday as rumors spread that American servicemen had desecrated a Koran and defiled local women in a nearby village. Taliban provocateurs on the scene whipped up a crowd and goaded it to violence, local officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the riot was over, at least eight protesters were dead and about a dozen wounded, shot by Afghan intelligence officers. Much of the town of Garmsir blamed the Americans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The episode, which American officers said they were investigating, highlighted how easily suspicions and resentment can flare out of control in an area as contested as the Helmand River Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, two United States service members were killed Wednesday in a bomb blast in eastern Afghanistan, NATO said in a statement without giving details, The Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their deaths brought to 12 the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan so far this month; 16 other soldiers from the international coalition have died this month. The A.P. said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thousands of American Marines and soldiers -- the majority of the reinforcements President Obama has sent so far to try to turn the tide of the war -- are moving into areas there that had previously stood as uncontested Taliban strongholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Kabul, American commanders denied that their service members had engaged in any offensive conduct. But the damage, it seemed, had been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The protest began when several thousand Afghans gathered in the central bazaar in Garmsir, after reports of abuse by American servicemen during a raid at a nearby village two nights before. Local officials said the protest was organized by the Taliban's shadow governor for Garmsir, Mullah Mohammed Naim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban were provoking the people,'' Kamal Khan, Helmand Province's deputy police chief, said in a telephone interview. ''They were telling the people that the Americans and their Afghan partners are killing innocent people, bombing their homes and destroying their mosques and also blaspheming their religion and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban were telling the people, 'This is jihad; you should sacrifice yourselves.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No witnesses to the disputed raid could be located; it took place Sunday night in the village of Darweshan. American officers in Kabul said that Afghan soldiers conducted a nighttime operation in the village, with the Americans in support. But they said that no shots had been fired and that no one had engaged in any inappropriate conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The protesters in Garmsir began shouting ''Death to America'' and ''Death to Kamal Khan'' and overturned several cars. They set a school on fire. Then they stormed the local office of the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan domestic intelligence service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The N.D.S. is sometimes blamed for providing faulty intelligence to the Americans, who then detain the wrong people. As the crowd moved in, N.D.S. officers opened fire, Mr. Khan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the 8 protesters killed and 13 wounded, an Afghan intelligence officer and two police officers were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the chaos unfolded, American officials said, a Taliban sniper began firing into a nearby American base, Forward Operating Base Delhi, a few hundred yards away. American officers said they killed the sniper but no one else. In a statement, the Americans denied that they had fired on any protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Khan, the deputy police chief, seconded that. ''There were no Americans there,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the episode appeared to have soured relations between the Americans and at least some Afghans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans are blaspheming the holy Koran and violating and disrespecting our culture,'' said Jan Gul, a farmer whose son was killed in the protest. ''We cannot tolerate such behavior. We will defend our religion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, some Afghans at the demonstration maintained that the American forces were present with the N.D.S. agents and fired on the crowd. But Mr. Khan and American officers in Kabul said that was not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While denying these allegations, we take them very seriously and support a combined investigation with local Afghan authorities,'' Maj. Gen. Michael Regner said in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I.S.A.F. is an international force that includes Muslim soldiers, and we deplore such an action under any circumstances,'' he said, using the abbreviation for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least 363 American and other NATO service personnel have been killed in Helmand, more than in any other Afghan province. Helmand received the bulk of the 17,000 additional soldiers Mr. Obama sent to the region after taking office last January, and it will get at least some of the 30,000 reinforcements that he ordered last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garmsir is an especially difficult area. It was under Taliban control until May 2008, when a force of American Marines swept in and cleared the town. Since then, the Marines have been trying to secure the area and establish a government. In fact, they have brought a measure of calm to Garmsir and its environs, an area six miles long and six miles wide. But outside Garmsir -- and sometimes inside it -- the Taliban are still operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also Tuesday, 16 people suspected of being insurgents were killed in a pair of Hellfire missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched by unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Airstrikes by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have drawn great attention in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where the C.I.A. has used Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the larger Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to find and kill Taliban and Qaeda fighters in the rugged areas along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, by contrast, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out by the United States Air Force are rarely publicized. In 2002, officials with the C.I.A. used a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fire a missile at a warlord, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, outside Kabul, but missed. Until Monday, there had been very few publicized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Afghan side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, the American command in Kabul said the more lethal of the two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place in Now Zad, where the missile was fired at a group of men moving military equipment. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 13 people suspected of being insurgents, the statement said. An Afghan in the area who was interviewed by telephone said that those killed had in fact been insurgents, and that no civilians had been harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second missile was fired in the Nad Ali District, killing three insurgents, the command said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In both instances, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired Hellfire missiles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 10 people were killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday morning that was aimed at the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, according to Pakistani security officials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> several Pakistani security officials said there was no word on the  whereabouts or condition of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, who claimed responsibility for a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed eight people at a C.I.A. base in southeastern Afghanistan last month. But a Taliban spokesman said Mr. Mehsud was not among the casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The important thing for us is whether Hakimullah is among those killed,'' said a Pakistani official in South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani intelligence official said he believed that Mr. Mehsud was ''definitely targeted'' in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which struck a compound in a remote region near the border of the tribal regions of North and South Waziristan about 7 a.m. Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have been trying to kill Mr. Mehsud with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but they rarely discuss the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and would not immediately confirm whether he had been the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud became leader of the Pakistani Taliban in 2009, succeeding the previous chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in South Waziristan in August. Hakimullah Mehsud, a member of the same tribe, had been the target of at least one earlier airstrike, according to American and Pakistani officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last April, Hakimullah Mehsud escaped unhurt when an American missile struck a militant training camp in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. A video released last week showed him seated next to Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, the Jordanian who carried out the Dec. 30 bombing of the C.I.A. base in Afghanistan. The men claimed that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was retribution for the killing of Baitullah Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed five C.I.A. officers, including the head of the base, as well as two private contractors for Xe Services, formerly known as Blackwater, and a Jordanian intelligence agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has been fighting the Taliban in the country's northwest, and three months ago it launched a major operation to drive militants allied with Mr. Mehsud out of sanctuaries in South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many of the guerrillas  fled to other parts of the country's lawless tribal areas and have been blamed for a string of bombings and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have killed more than 600 people throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials have so far resisted pressure from American officials to drive out fighters in North Waziristan, among them the Taliban faction led by  Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose fighters primarily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American and NATO troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A militant of Palestinian origin who had been on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list was killed in an American airstrike, two Pakistani intelligence officials said Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But an American intelligence official in Washington said that he could not yet confirm the Pakistani claim. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past, American officials have been more cautious than their Pakistani counterparts in declaring that American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had killed militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials believe that the militant, Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim, was connected with the Sept. 5, 1986, hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, in which at least 20 passengers were killed; the American government had offered a $5 million reward for his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani officials said that Mr. Rahim was killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last Saturday with three other militants in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Associated Press reported that Mr. Rahim had been tried and convicted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but that he and three other suspects were apparently released in January 2008. All four were added to the F.B.I. list late last year, the agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans have identified Mr. Rahim as a Lebanese-born Palestinian belonging to the Abu Nidal organization. The Pakistani officials said he was with Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was part of a spate of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conducted by the United States this month in an attempt to kill top leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in their sanctuaries in the mountains of western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Last August, the No. 1 Taliban commander, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in such a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani security officials said a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday was directed at Mr. Mehsud's successor, Hakimullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, there were conflicting reports about what might have happened to Mr. Mehsud. A militant said by phone that Mr. Mehsud was wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But The Associated Press quoted a commander, Omar Khatab, saying that Mr. Mehsud had not been wounded and that he was leading fighters in South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An audiotape of a man claiming to be Mr. Mehsud surfaced on Friday, in which he denied claims that he had died, although The Associated Press reported that the recording made no mention of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday, an indication that it could have been recorded earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which sometimes inadvertently kill civilians, have been publicly condemned by the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a violation of national sovereignty. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component,'' Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me last fall. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot ''seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance.'' Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would send a debilitating message to the world. ''If something happens on the podium and there's chaos,'' this official told me, ''that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The threat seemed to weigh on Obama. He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House. David Axelrod, his senior adviser, later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot. ''He seemed more subdued than he had been,'' Axelrod told me not long ago. Obama had not yet taken office, and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency. No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate, it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security -- and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself, his wife and their two daughters. ''It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into,'' Axelrod said. ''But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats, it's a very sobering moment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years. His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration. The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it. The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration -- Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, James Jones and their colleagues on the other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton immediately put her finger on a problem. According to participants, she asked, What should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall? ''Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address?'' she asked. ''I don't think so.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among those in the room was Robert Gates, who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama. Gates would eventually stay away from the inauguration in a secret location. With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate, Gates -- an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief -- was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan, a former C.I.A. officer. A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush, Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the White House. He had wanted to be C.I.A. director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order, so instead he was made assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he helped manage the inaugural threat, culling reports and coordinating between two administrations, Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists. If it is now Obama's war, Brennan is his general. And the first battle set the tone. ''It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing, on the eve of the inauguration,'' Brennan told me in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic ''poison pen,'' when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals, and he was right. In this case, officials familiar with the situation said, some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans. In the end, what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a fledgling president, the incident would be a lesson in the fluid, murky nature of terrorism. The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not, tracking down where threats begin, figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence. The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BARACK OBAMA WAS inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism. He inherited two struggles -- one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that divides his own country over issues like torture, prosecutions, security and what it means to be an American. The first has proved to be complicated and daunting. The second makes the first look easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the past 12 months. Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years, depending on who is talking. In fact, the new president, during his first year, has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office, a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept. 11, 2001. He did, however, shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama, then, found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable, splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology. Where Bush saw black and white, Obama sees gray. Where Bush favored swagger, Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect. Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism, Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them -- even without attacking again -- to alter the nature of American society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda, Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror, as Bush's was. He has given relatively few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article. Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time, Obama rejects the phrase ''war on terror'' altogether, hoping to recast the struggle as only one of a number of vital challenges confronting America. The nation is at war with Al Qaeda, Obama says, but not with terrorism, which, as he understands it, is a tactic, not an enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism -- you know, are you with us or against us, black and white, this global war on terror,'' Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless, low-ceilinged, soundproof office in the West Wing, where mobile phones are banned. ''It was almost all-consuming. It was the driving force for our foreign policies, that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror.'' That attitude, Brennan went on to say, proved counterproductive. ''This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda,'' he said. ''But at the same time, what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the ''mood music'' -- choice of language, outreach to Muslims, rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration. He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells, aides said, but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism. ''If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year, he would put Cairo in the top three,'' Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The policies themselves, though, have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest. ''The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration,'' Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, ''but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency, neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago, when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel, concrete and bodies. Yet that mood can change in a hurry, as the Christmas Day plot showed. Obama understands that, if only by the law of averages, there is a decent chance of a successful major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States during his presidency. And if that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> happens, any change in policy, no matter how incidental to the facts of the case, will be fodder for critics to blame him for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month, a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president. If Bush's system was broken, they asked, why didn't Obama fix it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself -- how he reacted, how he spoke, how he led. Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan, who was back in Washington, it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public, and when he did, he was typically cool and cerebral, with none of Bush's bring-it-on, dead-or-alive rhetoric. Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, or that Reid was charged in civilian court, not as an enemy combatant; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war. Bush felt it in his gut. Obama thinks about it in his head. If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened, wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people? Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information? Yet with the country afraid, is it possible to overthink it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You've got almost two extremes,'' Henry Crumpton, who led the C.I.A.'s operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush, told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt. ''You've got Bush 43, who aspired to have a warrior's ethos. He was driven, I think, by that, and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions, Iraq being the most horrible extreme. Obama comes at it from the other extreme. He comes at it like a lawyer would, someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos. And it is a war. You've got guys out there who want to kill us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA WAS A STATE senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania. He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio. ''By the time I arrived at my meeting,'' he wrote in his book ''The Audacity of Hope,'' ''the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose, but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept. 11. As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring of 2007, when he was a presidential candidate, Obama met Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security. The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings. ''When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch, he was finishing the sentences,'' Clarke told me. ''I'd like to think it was because he read my book, but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book. He'd talked with a lot of people. He'd read a lot about it. And he had a real understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser, and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to. His advisers told him he had a choice: he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security, Democrats also have hairy chests, as one put it, or he could develop a new paradigm. Obama, typically, found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing, although he threw in a vow to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> terrorists in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even, if necessary, without permission of its government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is time to turn the page,'' he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007. He said that ''America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil; we are not at war with Islam.'' He criticized claims of ''unchecked presidential power'' and vowed ''to close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions.'' He said ''that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens, no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime'' and ''no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he won the presidency more than a year later, he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world. The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in. They confronted him with the dark side, as Cheney once put it. ''The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table,'' Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change, appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle. ''Mr. President-elect, we're doing things very well, but we're losing the messaging war,'' Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told him a week after the election, according to an official informed about the session. A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world, Leiter maintained. ''You have an opportunity to change that message, to change how the struggle is perceived,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama was receptive to that mandate. ''We're going to do that,'' he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president, Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day. ''That's mostly what they talked about,'' a senior Bush adviser told me. ''I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level, but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times. Yet for all the cooperation, Obama chose to make one of his first acts a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Bush legacy, signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel, Greg Craig, that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guantanamo closed within a year. The move generated debate about timing and tactics. John Podesta, who ran Obama's transition, agreed with the policy but argued against making Guantanamo the first priority right after inauguration, according to colleagues. Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism. ''The language we use matters,'' he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office. So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration. ''War on terror'' was out; so were ''Islamofascism'' and ''evildoers.'' The new language did not always go over well. While testifying to Congress a year ago, Napolitano used the phrase ''man-caused disasters,'' and though she said ''terrorism'' elsewhere in her remarks, she drew wide scorn. (''I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate,'' she later told me. ''It was just a mistake. In the editing process, that phrase, usually it's 'terrorism or other man-caused disasters.' '')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BRENNAN, WHO HAS emerged in recent days as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy, is solidly built, with a weathered face and close-cropped, retreating hair. His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room, studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives. He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily. He is a serious man in a serious business, a career man, a survivor, someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed. And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A native of North Bergen, N.J., Brennan, who is 54, attended Catholic schools, all the way through Fordham University. After his freshman year, he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there, and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview, Brennan developed a case of youthful wanderlust. He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians at the American University in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While reading The New York Times on a bus one day, he saw a C.I.A. recruitment ad and decided to apply. When I asked why, he gave an answer that sounded as if it came from an espionage novel. ''Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth,'' he said of the nation's first spy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the C.I.A., Brennan rose through the ranks, becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s, a time of rising Islamic terrorism. Just months before he arrived in Riyadh, terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex, killing 19 American service members. During his tour, they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. A favorite of George J. Tenet, the C.I.A. director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush, Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Sept. 11, Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director. But his steady rise reached a peak. When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center, bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror, he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job. Brennan, unhappy, left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled, ''Mr. President, You're Wrong on Iraq.'' In keeping with C.I.A. rules, he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication. A copy found its way to the White House, where it angered top officials. Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C.I.A. review, but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House. ''He was dead to them,'' says a friend and fellow senior official, who did not want to be named discussing internal matters. An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House. Obama presented another chance. ''This is redemption,'' the friend says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C.I.A. briefer in the Clinton White House, was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007. Obama grew to like Brennan's precise, matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C.I.A. director. But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man, a C.I.A. careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror, rankled Obama supporters on the left. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stephen Soldz, a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists. The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's ''Frontline,'' in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing. ''We know, of course, that 'the appropriate Department of Justice review' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government,'' Soldz's letter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions. ''There was a real debate within the agency, including today, about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go, because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use,'' he told PBS. ''We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, human rights advocates have a point about continuity. For all his talk of change, Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place. Besides Brennan, there is Gates still atop the Pentagon, as well as Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush, and Michael Vickers, still the assistant defense secretary for special operations. While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C.I.A., he kept the deputy director, Stephen Kappes, along with Leiter, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan, but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer, Gen. David Petraeus, and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Bush's Iraq war czar, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. To manage the effort to close Guantanamo, Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried. The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey, and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of those people, of course, were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration, not the Cheney cadre, or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years. ''I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding,'' Brennan told me. ''I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program. But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with.'' For instance, he offered, ''if you grab somebody by the lapels, and you say, Oh, my goodness, you've violated their rights as a person, well, I'm not going to go that far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time and circumstances have changed as well. ''Four years ago, I would have said -- and I did say -- the agency's detention program needed to continue,'' Brennan said, referring to the secret ''black site'' overseas prisons run by the C.I.A. ''There have been a lot of developments and changes, so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago, because of the changed conditions, because of a new administration, whatever, I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all. I've changed my views.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job. But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz. ''I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama,'' he said. ''And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under. So I'm having these battles inside myself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER Obama took office, I sat down with the president, along with three colleagues from The Times, in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio. Now that he was in office, we asked what, if anything, he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The candidate who denounced the ''color-coded politics of fear'' and rejected policies that ''compromised our most precious values'' was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time. He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9/11 and where we were by the time I took office,'' he told us. ''I think the C.I.A., for example, and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention, took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency, and when Obama took office, the course he set was mostly to accelerate the evolution that was already under way. Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings, Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power. Two years before leaving office, he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor, even a Democrat, would not feel compelled to reverse direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time Obama was inaugurated, waterboarding had been halted for years, Bush had ordered that the secret C.I.A. black site prisons be emptied, and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress. Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guantanamo prison, and although he never managed to do so, his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama built on those actions. ''We've benefited from their experiences, both the good and the bad,'' Emanuel told me. While setting a one-year deadline to close Guantanamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor, Obama left the surveillance program intact, embraced the Patriot Act, retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets. He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign, albeit with more due-process safeguards. He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely. And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part,they were comfortable with Obama's policies, although they were reluctant to say so on the record. Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did, while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course. And they generally resented Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and were unwilling to give him political cover by defending him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under Bush, was willing to say publicly what others would not. ''There is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration,'' Hayden told me. James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter. ''I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite,'' he said. ''It's Bush. It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric. You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not every Bush veteran agrees, of course. Marc Thiessen, a former White House speechwriter, has a new book called ''Courting Disaster: How the C.I.A. Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary, told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama, Washington had ''lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism.'' Most disturbing to the Bush camp, even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies, have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A., to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C.I.A. officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-declared mastermind of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to New York to face trial in civilian court. Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser, last spring not to alienate the C.I.A. by dredging up the past. ''You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service,'' Hayden recalled saying. ''If these guys don't think you have their back, they're not going to be very adventurous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is ample historical precedent for this cycle. During times of national crisis, Washington often claims more authority, sometimes to the point of excess, then slowly cedes it back, from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another. ''Historically the more we move away from a crisis, the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing, and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance,'' says Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bush has pointed to another historical pattern. In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign, he predicted that if a Democrat won, he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman. Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office, Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place. Of course, this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that, like Truman, he will look better in the eyes of history. A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity, arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation. But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stone, who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school, says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States. ''He may feel in fact,'' Stone says, ''that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was, that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  STONE JOINED A GROUP of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention. Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty, arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision to close the Guantanamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress, even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states. And while the administration has selected an Illinois facility to house some of the detainees, the Jan. 22 deadline to close Guantanamo will not be met. An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed. And although Obama authorized the release of memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned, he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Brennan, these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush. But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times. When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C.I.A. interrogation methods, Brennan initially agreed, reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned. But he later reversed himself and sided with the C.I.A., which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work. Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued unsuccessfully that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington, and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation to release the photos. Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel, who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room, Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues. Everyone in the room raised hard questions, voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters. Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U. ''Look, you're the only politician I've ever believed in,'' Romero said, according to people in the room. ''When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York, I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you. But this stuff really pains me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama pushed back, explaining the constraints he was under. It was a balancing act, he said; he had multiple obligations. Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guantanamo, those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release. ''He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options,'' says Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I talked with Romero later, he would not describe his interaction with Obama, but he expressed his frustration. While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies, Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the ''hubris'' of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely. ''He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did,'' Romero told me. ''If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one worries about what he'll do when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding some terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges. Just a few years earlier, he wrote in his book that ''when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial,'' then ''we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes.'' Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention. Romero and the A.C.L.U. began preparing a campaign against any proposed legislation if he went forward, soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu, trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics. But then the administration reversed course; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era, it would not enshrine the power in law and signaled that it would not use it for future cases. ''We were gearing up for the battle of our lives,'' Romero said. ''Fortunately, they turned back from the abyss.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Brennan said Obama ''is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach,'' one that would be more ''multidimensional'' without letting terrorism define American foreign policy. Among other things, he emphasized the ''upstream factors,'' meaning the conditions that fuel extremism, and vowed to promote ''a political, economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people -- security for their communities, education for children, a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But something else was happening inside the White House. Some in the West Wing, like Emanuel, worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York. Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department, but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call. Still, by the end of the year, the activists' favorite ally in the West Wing, Greg Craig, was out. He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror, some that he won and others that he lost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House,'' Romero lamented. ''The others either demur or mumble.'' Craig's ouster, he added, was ''unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AT THE HOUSE that John Brennan built, about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to, at least as much as they can. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins. Obama came to visit last fall, and Brennan accompanied him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from ''24,'' the Fox television show, with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms -- C.I.A., F.B.I., D.O.D., N.S.A., D.I.A., D.H.S., D.N.I., T.S.A. and so on -- sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos, intercepted telephone calls, satellite imagery, reports from the field, news accounts and myriad other ''intelligence streams,'' as they are known. A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN. Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world. Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This place was supposed to help stop the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since Sept. 11, government agencies like the NCTC have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last few months alone, the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States. But the cliche is right -- the government has to be right 100 percent of the time, while the other side needs to succeed only once. And Brennan produced a report this month that criticized the NCTC, his old organization, for failing to pull together intelligence that was available about Al Qaeda and Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's criticsabout whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism. Buthe has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists. With information processed at the NCTC and elsewhere, Obama has authorized the C.I.A. to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Critics complain that such ''targeted assassinations'' are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed. Obama had a searching conversation during the transition with Brennan and Denis McDonough, Catholics who oppose the death penalty, about whether to keep the program. ''He was wrestling with it,'' one adviser says. But in the end, there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program. At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president, according to a participant, Obama said pointedly, ''The C.I.A. gets what it needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. launched more than 50 such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Obama's first year in office, more than during Bush's entire presidency, according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation. In part, that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties. And in part, it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there; when the Obama administration came into office, it learned that dozens of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up, according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program. Obama has authorized doubling the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Pakistani border area, as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the course of Obama's first year in office, his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have taken out a number of ''high-value targets,'' including Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban; Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; and Tahir Yuldashev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of Al Qaeda. At the same time, according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann, the civilian death rate of those killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008. Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower. ''I don't hear anyone inside the government, including people like me who came from outside, who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential,'' a senior Obama counterterrorism official says. ''There are a lot of negatives, but it is completely essential.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well. When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel, in southern Somalia, officials debated three options, including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country, several officials told me. Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him with a plan for an airstrike, which he approved. Weather on the day of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prompted a change in plans, and commanders instead authorized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters to sweep into Somalia. Nabhan was killed. American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen, the poor, unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from. Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together. It is a breeding ground for extremism, the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. At the same time, it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo come from, making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there. Obama has ordered more training, equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government; about $70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces, doubling previous spending, and the administration has announced it will double it again next year. Last month the American government provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts. Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen to transition former Guantanamo detainees back into society. But for all the attention on Yemen, Brennan has now acknowledged that he and the rest of the American government underestimated the capacity of Al Qaeda's branch there to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA WAS SINGING Christmas carols with his family at a rental house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit. The president got on the phone with Brennan, who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals hidden in his underwear, only to have passengers and crew jump him. Soon enough, Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama team's initial public response was less than sure-footed. Obama referred to Abdulmutallab as an ''isolated extremist,'' and Janet Napolitano said that ''the system worked.'' Obama would soon learn how wrong both assessments were. While on vacation he was given an 80-page review of the Fort Hood shooting; it looked at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government. The night after his first statement, the president's advisers learned that something similar happened in the Detroit case: the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning. He was simmering. ''Let me make this very clear to you,'' he told the advisers, according to two of them. ''While I understand intelligence is hard, and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence, what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared.'' After hanging up with Brennan, aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media. Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What's the deal?'' Obama asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm just about done,'' McDonough said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, just move over.'' Obama sat down and finished it himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's statement that there was a ''systemic failure'' did not quell the political furor. White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism. After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists, David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, who revised it and posted on the White House Web site. The criticism got Brennan's back up too, particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about,'' he told me after the Christmas Day attempt. Some Republicans, including Cheney, were blatantly mischaracterizing the record, he fumed. ''When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda, that is just complete hogwash.'' It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations. ''What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort, which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident. ''I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately,'' Brennan told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber, some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists. In recent months, authorities have arrested a number of American citizens and legal residents, including Najibullah Zazi, an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York after receiving training in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai. Just a week ago, authorities arrested two associates of Zazi's. And then there is the Fort Hood shooting rampage, as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supposedly to join the jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If they are the next wave, American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop. The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado. ''Although no one wants to admit it, I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States,'' Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism scholar, told me. ''It's way different than it was in the Bush years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it. In October, Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to look for holes to close. Napolitano told me: ''We can't operate in the paradigm that if they </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> us, they would be coming from other countries into the United States. We have some that are homegrown. That is a change.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all the lawyerly focus on Guantanamo and the rules of war, the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief. It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, he declared that ''evil does exist in the world.'' After the Christmas Day plot, his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, consciously or not, used the term ''war on terror.'' The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows, the first such foray for the C.I.A. veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama made almost as many statements about terrorism in the two weeks following Christmas as he did in the 11 months preceding it, not counting those focused on Afghanistan. ''Our nation is at war,'' Obama declared on Jan. 2. ''We are at war,'' he said five days later as he released reports on the Detroit plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The war goes on, abroad and at home. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missiles fired from American aircraft killed as many as 15 people in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sunday, Pakistani security officials said, part of an increased campaign by the United States to use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a compound owned by a member of the Mehsud tribe, which leads the Pakistani Taliban, in the Shaktu area of South Waziristan. The area is near the border with Afghanistan where the Pakistani military has been conducting operations against the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday killed 12 militants in the same area, and according to Pakistani security officials, it wounded Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of Pakistani Taliban. His predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Shaktu area of South Waziristan borders North Waziristan, which American officials say is the main haven for militants from Al Qaeda and for the Afghan Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military's operation in South Waziristan is believed to have forced militants to flee to North Waziristan, and the United States has been pressing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to conduct operations there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hakimullah Mehsud claimed responsibility for the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed eight people at a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, late last month. His appearance in a video with the bomber suggested strong links between the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda, as well as the Afghan Taliban.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A militant belonging to Abu Sayyaf, the Islamist separatist group fighting the government in the Philippines, was killed in a recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, according to a Pakistani intelligence official and a local television report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struck a compound on Jan. 14 in the Shaktu area of South Waziristan, along the Afghan border, in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that appeared to be aimed at the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If proved true, the presence of the Filipino, Abdul Basit Usman, provides another indication that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas have become a collecting point for militants from around the globe who use the areas as a refuge to link up with Al Qaeda. It also shows the close ties of Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a few days earlier killed another militant, this one of Palestinian origin, who was on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Basit, a Filipino citizen and bomb-making expert, has links to the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah as well as Abu Sayyaf, according to the State Department. It says he is responsible for bombings in the southern Philippines in 2006 and 2007 that killed 15 people, and has a $1 million reward out for his capture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Sayyaf is believed to have received support from Al Qaeda since the early 1990s. The United States sends $1.6 billion annually in military and economic aid to the Philippine government, much of it aimed at countering the shadowy separatist group, which remains active on the southern island of Basilan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While traveling in South Asia this week, Defense Secretary Robert M.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The presence of foreign militants like Mr. Basit underscored the point, as did the  suicide bombing last month at a C.I.A. base in southeast Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, the United States has stepped up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with 12 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported since Dec. 30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will provide a dozen unarmed aerial spy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the first time as part of an effort to encourage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cooperation in fighting Islamic militants on the Afghanistan border, American defense officials said Thursday. But Pakistani military leaders, rebuffing American pressure, said they planned no new offensives for at least six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Shadow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which are smaller than armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will be a significant upgrade in the Pakistanis' reconnaissance and surveillance ability and will supply video to help cue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the ground or the air. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a two-day visit, disclosed plans for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, in an interview Thursday with a Pakistani television reporter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked if the United States planned to provide the Pakistani military with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, something it has long requested, Mr. Gates replied, ''There are some tactical U.A.V.'s that we are considering, yes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Defense Department officials later confirmed that the United States was making such an offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly before Mr. Gates's remarks, the chief spokesman of the Pakistani Army indicated that the army would not begin any assault against militants in the tribal region of North Waziristan for 6 to 12 months, pushing back against calls by the United States to root out militants staging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, told American reporters at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to stabilize its gains and contain Taliban militants scattered by offensives already opened last year. ''We are not capable of sustaining further military operations,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The developments underscored the difficulties that President Obama now faces in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Even as the Taliban have stepped up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on both sides of the border, the Pakistani Army has been reluctant to take on all of its factions in all parts of the country's tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which already has some limited surveillance ability, has long asked for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology from the United States, arguing that it should have the same resources to watch and kill militants on its own soil as does the Central Intelligence Agency, which conducts regular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have rejected giving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Shadow surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to be a compromise aimed at enticing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further into the war and helping the country's political leadership explain the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to a deeply suspicious and anti-American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will have a very positive political impact,'' said Talat Masood, a retired general in Islamabad. ''It will reduce the embarrassment of the political leadership.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American defense officials said that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be for use in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and would be restricted to defensive rather than offensive operations. One major concern for the American military is the possibility that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could use the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against India, its archrival in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest version of the Shadow is used by the United States Army and the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has a wing span of 14 feet, is about 12 feet long, is launched from a trailer by ground units and can fly about 70 miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates, who is on his first trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in three years, met Thursday with the Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and with Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the director of the country's spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. He attended a dinner in his honor given by President Asif Ali Zardari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said that Mr. Gates had urged the Pakistanis in the meetings to do more against the militants, a constant American theme that the defense secretary also sounded in an opinion article published on Thursday in The News International, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest English-language daily newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials are increasingly frustrated that while the Pakistanis have conducted offensives against the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda, they have not so far pursued the Afghan Taliban and an allied militant faction on their border, the Haqqani network, whose fighters pose a threat to American forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maintaining a distinction between some violent extremist groups and others is counterproductive,'' Mr. Gates wrote. ''Only by pressuring all of these groups on both sides of the border will Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be able to rid themselves of this scourge for good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say privately that the Pakistanis are reluctant to go after the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network because they see them as a future proxy against Indian interests in Afghanistan when the Americans leave. Under Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy, announced last month, the United States is to begin withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan by July 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the News International article, and in his public comments in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Gates lavishly praised the Pakistani Army for its efforts against the militants in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan, and noted that the army had suffered nearly 2,000 deaths in the last three years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also sought to reassure Pakistani citizens that Americans had a long-term interest in their country, not just in a short-term strategic gain across the border in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wrote  that he regretted  injustices in the American-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship that he himself has been part of since the late 1980s, when he was No. 2 at the C.I.A. At that time, he helped funnel  aid and weapons through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency to the Islamic fundamentalists who ousted the Russians from Afghanistan. Some of those fundamentalists are now part of the Taliban  fighting  the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates  also repeated an assessment that the militant groups on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border were an interconnected syndicate, a view that General Abbas rejected as not so ''black and white.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will provide a dozen unarmed aerial spy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the first time as part of an effort to encourage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cooperation in fighting Islamic militants on the Afghanistan border, American defense officials said Thursday. But Pakistani military leaders, rebuffing American pressure, said they planned no new offensives for at least six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Shadow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which are smaller than armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will be a significant upgrade in the Pakistanis' reconnaissance and surveillance ability and will supply video to help cue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the ground or the air.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a two-day visit, disclosed plans for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, in an interview Thursday with a Pakistani television reporter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked if the United States planned to provide the Pakistani military with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, something it has long requested, Mr. Gates replied, ''There are some tactical U.A.V.'s that we are considering, yes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Defense Department officials later confirmed that the United States was making such an offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly before Mr. Gates's remarks, the chief spokesman of the Pakistani Army indicated that the army would not begin any assault against militants in the tribal region of North Waziristan for 6 to 12 months, pushing back against calls by the United States to root out militants staging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, told American reporters at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to stabilize its gains and contain Taliban militants scattered by offensives already opened last year. ''We are not capable of sustaining further military operations,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The developments underscored the difficulties that President Obama now faces in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Even as the Taliban have stepped up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on both sides of the border, the Pakistani Army has been reluctant to take on all of its factions in all parts of the country's tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which already has some limited surveillance ability, has long asked for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology from the United States, arguing that it should have the same resources to watch and kill militants on its own soil as does the Central Intelligence Agency, which conducts regular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have rejected giving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Shadow surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to be a compromise aimed at enticing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further into the war and helping the country's political leadership explain the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to a deeply suspicious and anti-American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will have a very positive political impact,'' said Talat Masood, a retired general in Islamabad. ''It will reduce the embarrassment of the political leadership.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American defense officials said that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be for use in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and would be restricted to defensive rather than offensive operations. One major concern for the American military is the possibility that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could use the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against India, its archrival in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest version of the Shadow is used by the United States Army and the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has a wing span of 14 feet, is about 12 feet long, is launched from a trailer by ground units and can fly about 70 miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates, who is on his first trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in three years, met Thursday with the Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and with Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the director of the country's spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. He attended a dinner in his honor given by the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, and is to deliver a speech on American policy on Friday before a military audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said that Mr. Gates had urged the Pakistanis in the meetings to do more against the militants, a constant American theme that the defense secretary also sounded in an opinion article published on Thursday in The News International, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest English-language daily newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the article, Mr. Gates implicitly pressed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to root out the Afghan Taliban leadership, the Quetta Shura, which has found refuge in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baluchistan Province, outside the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials are increasingly frustrated that while the Pakistanis have conducted offensives against the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda, they have not so far pursued the Afghan Taliban and an allied militant faction on their border, the Haqqani network, whose fighters pose a threat to American forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maintaining a distinction between some violent extremist groups and others is counterproductive,'' Mr. Gates wrote. ''Only by pressuring all of these groups on both sides of the border will Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be able to rid themselves of this scourge for good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say privately that the Pakistanis are reluctant to go after the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network because they see them as a future proxy against Indian interests in Afghanistan when the Americans leave. Under Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy, announced last month, the United States is to begin withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan by July 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the same article in The News International, and in his public comments in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Gates lavishly praised the Pakistani Army for its efforts against the militants in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan, and noted that the army had suffered nearly 2,000 deaths in the last three years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also sought to reassure Pakistani citizens that Americans had a long-term interest in their country, not just in a short-term strategic gain across the border in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates said in the article that he regretted past injustices in the American-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship that he himself has been part of since the late 1980s, when he was No. 2 at the C.I.A. At that time, he helped funnel covert Reagan administration aid and weapons through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency to the Islamic fundamentalists who ousted the Russians from Afghanistan. Some of those fundamentalists are now part of the Taliban and are fighting against the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates said that the United States largely abandoned Afghanistan and cut military ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once the Russians left Kabul, which he called ''a grave mistake driven by some well-intentioned but short-sighted U.S. legislative and policy decisions.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also repeated an assessment that the militant groups on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border were an inter-connected syndicate, a view that General Abbas rejected as not as ''black and white'' as Mr. Gates described.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the suicide bombing that took the lives of seven Americans in Afghanistan on Dec. 30, the Central Intelligence Agency has struck back against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the most intensive series of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft since the covert program began. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beginning the day after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, the agency has carried out 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have killed about 90 people suspected of being militants, according to Pakistani news reports, which make almost no mention of civilian casualties. The assault has included </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a mud fortress in North Waziristan on Jan. 6 that killed 17 people and a volley of missiles on a compound in South Waziristan last Sunday that killed at least 20. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For the C.I.A., there is certainly an element of wanting to show that they can hit back,'' said Bill Roggio, editor of The Long War Journal, an online publication that tracks the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. Mr. Roggio, as well as Pakistani and American intelligence officials, said many of the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had focused on the Pakistani Taliban and its leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, who claimed responsibility for the Khost bombing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Khost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cost the agency dearly, taking the lives of the most experienced analysts of Al Qaeda whose intelligence helped guide the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the agency has responded by redoubling its assault. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have come roughly every other day this month, up from about once a week last year and the most furious pace since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign began in earnest in the summer of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announcement on Thursday that its army would delay any new offensives against militants in North Waziristan for 6 to 12 months is likely to increase American reliance on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration and counterterrorism officials said. By next year, the C.I.A. is expected to more than double its fleet of the latest Reaper aircraft -- bigger, faster and more heavily armed than the older Predators -- to 14 from 6, an Obama administration official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before the Khost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House officials had made it clear to Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, and Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, that they expected significant results from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in reducing the threat from Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban, according to an administration official and a former senior C.I.A. official with close ties to the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These concerns only heightened after the attempted Dec. 25 bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner. While that plot involved a Nigerian man sent by a Qaeda offshoot in Yemen, intelligence officials say they believe that Al Qaeda's top leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have called on affiliates to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West. ''There's huge pressure from the White House on Blair and Panetta,'' said the former C.I.A. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern about angering the White House. ''The feeling is, the clock is ticking.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Khost bombing, intelligence officials vowed that they would retaliate. One angry senior American intelligence official said the C.I.A. would ''avenge'' the Khost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Some very bad people will eventually have a very bad day,'' the official said at the time, speaking on the condition he not be identified describing a classified program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, officials deny that vengeance is driving the increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though one called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''the purest form of self-defense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials point to other factors. For one, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently dropped restrictions on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program it had requested last fall to accompany a ground offensive against militants in South Waziristan. And tips on the whereabouts of extremists ebb and flow unpredictably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A C.I.A. spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, declined to comment on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he said, ''The agency's counterterrorism operations -- lawful, aggressive, precise and effective -- continue without pause.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out from a secret base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and controlled by satellite link from C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia, have been expanded by President Obama and praised by both parties in Congress as a potent weapon against terrorism that puts no American lives at risk. That calculation must be revised in light of the Khost bombing, which revealed the critical presence of C.I.A. officers in dangerous territory to direct the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some legal scholars have questioned the legitimacy under international law of killings by a civilian agency in a country where the United States is not officially at war. This month, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for government documents revealing procedures for approving targets and legal justifications for the killings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Critics have contended that collateral civilian deaths are too high a price to pay. Pakistani officials have periodically denounced the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a violation of their nation's sovereignty, even as they have provided a launching base for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increase in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has caused panic among rank-and-file militants, particularly in North Waziristan, where some now avoid using private vehicles, according to Pakistani intelligence and security officials. Fewer foreign extremists are now in Miram Shah, North Waziristan's capital, which was previously awash with them, said local tribesmen and security officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the consensus in Washington behind the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, some experts are dissenters. John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School who frequently advises the military, said, ''The more the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign works, the more it fails -- as increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only make the Pakistanis angrier at the collateral damage and sustained violation of their sovereignty.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the United States expands the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond the lawless tribal areas to neighboring Baluchistan, as is under discussion, the backlash ''might even spark a social revolution in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Arquilla said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far the reaction in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been muted. Last week, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's senior diplomat for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> undermined the larger war effort. But the issue was not at the top of the agenda as it was a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hasan Askari Rizvi, a military analyst in Lahore, said public opposition had been declining because the campaign was viewed as a success. Yet one Pakistani general, who supports the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a tactic for keeping militants off balance, questioned the long-term impact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Has the situation stabilized in the past two years?'' asked the general, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Are the tribal areas more stable?'' Yes, he said, Baitullah Mehsud, founder of the Pakistani Taliban, was killed by a missile last August. ''But he's been replaced and the number of fighters is increasing,'' the general said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders denied that extremists -- in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and neighboring Afghanistan -- posed a mortal threat to their country. After the Pakistani Taliban got within 60 miles of Islamabad last April they decided that they had no choice but to fight back. They were right. Unfortunately, their understanding of self-interest seems to stop at a border that the Taliban certainly does not respect. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates pressed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military leaders to open a new front against Afghan militants using Pakistani territory to stage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan -- and was promptly rebuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Displaying an alarming denial about the nature and urgency of the threat, an Army spokesman said there would be no offensive in the tribal region of North Waziristan -- where the Afghan Taliban are based -- for at least six months and perhaps as long as 12 months. Given the speed and virulence with which the extremists have spread their hatred and violence in the past year, that's too long to wait. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To its credit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army has mounted big offensives against Pakistani Taliban factions in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan and paid a steep price: losing 2,000 soldiers in battle. It may need some time to solidify these gains and prepare a new assault. But that is almost certainly not the real reason behind the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army and spy service helped create the Afghan Taliban, and even now they see the group as a proxy force to limit India's influence in Afghanistan once the Americans leave. That is truly playing with fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failure to pressure both Taliban groups could doom President Obama's military and political offensive in Afghanistan -- or force him to make good on his threat to go after militants in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border region if Islamabad does not. This is not just America's fight. As Mr. Gates warned this week,  extremist groups on the border are interconnected and determined to destabilize the entire region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot afford to give the Afghan Taliban a pass, and Washington must make sure that Islamabad faces up to that reality. Mr. Gates tried to nudge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he spoke publicly about how Islamabad cannot ''ignore one part of this cancer and pretend it won't have some impact closer to home.'' We hope he was firmer in private. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates and other officials are working hard to persuade Islamabad that the United States will not repeat past mistakes and abandon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as it did after the Soviets withdrew 20 years ago.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration's decision this week to grant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> longstanding request for aerial spy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (unarmed, at Washington's insistence) should help bridge the ''trust deficit.'' Washington must also do more to help lessen tensions between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India. That may be the best chance of persuading Islamabad that it can and must focus more of its troops and attention on fighting all of the Taliban. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody else in the Obama administration has been mired in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for as long as Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. So on a trip here this past week to try to soothe the country's growing rancor toward the United States, he served as a punching bag tested over a quarter-century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Are you with us or against us?'' a senior military officer demanded of Mr. Gates at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Defense University, according to a Pentagon official who recounted the remark made during a closed-door session after Mr. Gates gave a speech at the school on Friday. Mr. Gates, who could hardly miss that the officer was mimicking former President George W. Bush's  warning to nations harboring militants, simply replied, ''Of course we're with you.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was the essence of Mr. Gates's message over two days to the Pakistanis, who are angry about the Central Intelligence Agency's surge in missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft on militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, among other grievances, and showed no signs of feeling any love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trip, Mr. Gates's first to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in three years, proved that dysfunctional relationships span multiple administrations and that the history of American foreign policy is full of unintended consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the No. 2 official at the C.I.A. in the 1980s, Mr. Gates helped channel Reagan-era covert aid and weapons through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency to the American allies at the time: Islamic fundamentalists fighting the Russians in Afghanistan. Many of those fundamentalists regrouped as the Taliban, who gave sanctuary to Al Qaeda before the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and now threaten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In meetings on Thursday, Pakistani leaders repeatedly asked Mr. Gates to give them their own armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to go after the militants, not just a dozen smaller, unarmed ones that Mr. Gates announced as gifts meant to placate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and induce its cooperation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani journalists asked Mr. Gates if the United States had plans to take over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons (Mr. Gates said no) and whether the United States would expand the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> farther south into Baluchistan, as is under discussion. Mr. Gates did not answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the Pakistani Army's chief spokesman told American reporters at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi on Thursday that the military had no immediate plans to launch an offensive against extremists in the tribal region of North Waziristan, as American officials have repeatedly urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the spokesman, Maj. Gen Athar Abbas, rejected Mr. Gates's assertion that Al Qaeda had links to militant groups on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border. Asked why the United States would have such a view, the spokesman, General Abbas, curtly replied, ''Ask the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Abbas's comments, made only hours after Mr. Gates arrived in Islamabad, were an affront to an American ally that gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $3 billion in military aid last year. But American officials, trying to put a positive face on the general's remarks and laying out what they described as military reality, said that the Pakistani Army was stretched thin from offensives against militants in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan and probably did not have the troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They don't have the ability to go into North Waziristan at the moment,'' an American military official in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told reporters. ''Now, they may be able to generate the ability. They could certainly accept risk in certain places and relocate some of their forces, but obviously that then creates a potential hole elsewhere that could suffer from Taliban re-encroachment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates's advisers cast him as a good cop on a mission to encourage the Pakistanis rather than berate them. And he was characteristically low-key during most his visit here, including during a session with Pakistani journalists on Friday morning at the home of the American ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Anne W. Patterson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Gates perked up when he was brought some coffee, and he soon began to push back against General Abbas. American officials say that the real reason Pakistanis distinguish between the groups is that they are reluctant to go after those that they see as a future proxy against Indian interests in Afghanistan when the Americans leave. India is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archrival in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Dividing these individual extremist groups into individual pockets if you will is in my view a mistaken way to look at the challenge we all face,'' Mr. Gates said, then ticked off the collection on the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al Qaeda, the Taliban in Afghanistan, Tariki Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Haqqani network -- this is a syndicate of terrorists that work together,'' he said. ''And when one succeeds they all benefit, and they share ideas, they share planning. They don't operationally coordinate their activities, as best I can tell. But they are in very close contact. They take inspiration from one another, they take ideas from one another.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates, who repeatedly told the Pakistanis that he regretted their country's ''trust deficit'' with the United States and that Americans had made a grave mistake in abandoning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the Russians left Afghanistan, promised the military officers that the United States would do better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His final message delivered, he relaxed on the 14-hour trip home by watching ''Seven Days in May,'' the cold war-era film about an attempted military coup in the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Army's announcement last week that it planned no new offensive against militants for as long as a year has deeply frustrated senior American military officers, and chipped away at one of the cornerstones of President Obama's strategy to reverse the Taliban's gains in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Obama announced his decision in December to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he and his aides made clear that the chances of success hinged significantly on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willingness to eliminate militants' havens in its territory, including in the tribal region of North Waziristan. United States officials described the American and NATO surge of troops as a hammer, but they said it required a Pakistani anvil on the other side of the border to prevent the Taliban from retreating to the mountains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that strategy appears imperiled by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> latest statement. On Thursday, soon after Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates arrived on a two-day trip to the country, the Pakistani Army's chief spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, rebuffed American pressure to step up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan. That area is the main base of operations for the Haqqani network, which stages operations against American and Afghan forces in Afghanistan. It is believed to be responsible for many of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Kabul, including a devastating assault early last week near the presidential palace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fighters from Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban have also been concentrated in North Waziristan, including many who were driven out of their positions in South Waziristan by recent Pakistani Army operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This has become the center,'' a senior administration official said, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss American strategy publicly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said they had not been surprised by the Pakistani announcement. Since the last two years of the Bush administration, the United States has been arguing for a far more active Pakistani military presence in North Waziristan. But some said they had been surprised that the rebuff was issued while Mr. Gates was in the country, rather than after he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Abbas told reporters it could be 6 to 12 months before the army consolidated its current operations and began any new offensive. Some American officials think it could be longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The critical question is how much the Pakistani decision will undercut Mr. Obama's strategy. During a speech at West Point on Dec. 1, he said his administration would reassess the plan at the end of 2010, after all the troops deployed as part of the increase were in place. But if the Pakistani position does not change, the operations on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side of the border will not have begun by the time Mr. Obama has made his assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama made no public demands on Islamabad when he announced the troop increase at West Point, but he said he was acting ''with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' He quickly added: ''We need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama praised the Pakistani Army for waging an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban were taking aim at the country's fragile government. He promised to work with the Pakistanis to strengthen their ability to combat the militants, but he said the United States had ''made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials have not refused to go after Qaeda or Taliban fighters in North Waziristan. But they have made it clear that their forces are too tied up now to conduct new, larger operations on Washington's schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a practical matter, American officials said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inability or reluctance to open a new front in North Waziristan will increase the reliance on missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the C.I.A. to disrupt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said that Pakistani military leaders had never promised a specific timetable for beginning a new offensive, but that announcing a delay of as much as 12 months could aid the militants' planning and morale on both sides of the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's disappointing, but not entirely surprising,'' said a senior Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his ties with Pakistani counterparts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates and other American officials sought to put the best face on the situation last week, saying that the Pakistani Army was stretched thin from its previous offensives against militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Pakistani leadership will make its own decisions about what the best timing for their military operations is, about when they are ready to do something or whether they are going to do it at all,'' Mr. Gates told Pakistani journalists on Friday, the day after General Abbas's comments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The way I like to express it is, we're in this car together, but the Pakistanis are in the driver's seat and have their foot on the accelerator,'' Mr. Gates said. ''And that's just fine with me.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. David H. Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, said at a conference in Washington on Friday that American officials must be mindful of the limitations facing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Petraeus said that the Pakistani leaders would need to negotiate agreements with local tribal leaders to hold the gains that the Pakistani military has achieved in places like Swat and South Waziristan. But he emphasized that any deals must be more resilient than previous pacts in the tribal areas, which fell apart and allowed the militants to regain control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior American officers in the region said that cooperation with their Pakistani counterparts had improved in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NATO military leaders, for instance, recently provided a detailed briefing on the campaign in Afghanistan to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani army chief of staff, a senior American officer said. Pakistani officers reciprocated last week with a briefing for NATO officers on their campaign plans, the American officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7 Bodies Found With Warnings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The bodies of seven people accused by the Taliban of spying for the United States were found in North Waziristan on Sunday, officials and residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notes attached to the bullet-ridden bodies accused the victims of working with the United States as it carries out a wave of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region, and warned that anyone else who did so would meet the same end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region have increased significantly since the bombing of a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, that killed seven Americans on Dec. 30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Obama administration pours 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan, it has begun grappling with the next great dilemma of this long war: whether to reconcile with the men who sheltered Osama bin Laden and who still have close ties to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has said he wants to reach out to the leaders of the Taliban, and administration officials acknowledge privately that they are considering the idea. But they warn that the plan is rife with political risk at home and could jeopardize a widely backed effort to lure lower-ranking, more amenable Taliban fighters back into Afghan society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The debate, still in its early stages, could shape the next phase of America's engagement in Afghanistan, officials said, and is every bit as complicated as the decision on whether to commit more soldiers, not least because it rekindles memories of the Sept. 11 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, donor countries, led by the United States, Britain and Japan, are expected to commit $100 million a year to an Afghan fund for reintegrating the foot soldiers of the Taliban with jobs, cash and other inducements. But the allies are less sanguine about dealing with the Taliban's high command, particularly its leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, and other ''hard core'' Taliban elements which, the administration bluntly declared last March, were ''not reconcilable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One question is how likely these people are to be enticed by the inducements, given the gains the Taliban have made. Some American officials suggest the debate is premature, saying the Taliban have to be depleted through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and ground combat before they would return to the bargaining table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pros and cons of dealing with the Taliban will loom large at the conference in London this week, where Mr. Karzai is scheduled to present his plan for lower-level reintegration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mullah Omar remains off limits for the United States, the administration's openness to reconciling with other Taliban leaders has grown since last year, officials say, because of its recognition that the war is not going to be won purely on the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Today, people agree that part of the solution for Afghanistan is going to include an accommodation with the Taliban, even above low- and middle-level fighters,'' said an administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing internal deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, any grand bargain is bound to be messy, he said, with the Taliban most likely to demand government jobs or control of large areas of territory in Afghanistan's south, where it now rules by fear. What the United States would be willing to tolerate has become a hot issue inside the administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Already, the Pentagon has expressed skepticism about coming to terms with high-ranking Taliban figures anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's our view that until the Taliban leadership sees a change in the momentum and begins to see that they are not going to win, the likelihood of significant reconciliation at senior levels is not terribly great,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said last week in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the senior American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, said recently that he could eventually envision a role for some Taliban officials in Afghanistan's political establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other senior officials, like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., are said to be more open to reaching out, because they believe it will help shorten the military engagement in Afghanistan. The special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard C. Holbrooke, is also said by officials to be privately receptive, although he expressed doubts in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's very unclear on which basis you can have reconciliation with the Taliban leadership when they are still allied with Al Qaeda and pursue policies that would create permanent instability in Afghanistan and the region,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part of the problem is that the process could set off unpredictable forces. Some contend it could split the leadership of the Taliban, swelling the ranks of subordinates who accept the Afghan government's offer to lay down their arms. But skeptics argue that it could embolden the Taliban, by making their leaders think they have the upper hand against the Afghan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The more there is talk of negotiation, the more the Taliban view it as a sign of weakness,'' said Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on Afghanistan at the Brookings Institution. ''How do you make sure the reconciliation process does not embolden the Taliban to go on the march?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reconciliation has a troubled history in Afghanistan. In December 2007, Mr. Karzai expelled two Western officials for unauthorized contacts with the Taliban. The United Nations said the talks were with tribal elders, though one of the officials, Michael Semple, an Irishman who worked for the European Union, has written extensively since then about the value of negotiating with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are also inklings of a new openness on the part of Mullah Omar. Last September, he stirred some controversy in the extremist world with a public statement suggesting that he put the goal of retaking power in Afghanistan ahead of the global jihad favored by Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some analysts saw this as a sign of a rift between the two groups and a hint that Mullah Omar might be open to talks. The Taliban, he said, ''want to play our role in peace and stability of the region.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In London, Mr. Karzai is expected to provide details about reaching out to lower-level Taliban members. One question is whether he will ask the United Nations to remove Mullah Omar's name from a ''blacklist,'' which freezes bank accounts and prohibits travel for those on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blacklist is important because the government cannot negotiate with Taliban members whose names are on it. A United Nations Security Council committee said Tuesday that it had removed five senior Taliban from the list, Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For now, American military officials said, the focus will remain on lower-level street fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hope is that in the next few months, the 30,000 additional American troops will start to make a dent in the Taliban's offensive. Even then, American officials said, any reconciliation would require the Taliban leaders to renounce violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's a pretty high bar for the Taliban leadership to clear,'' said Brian Katulis, of the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group with ties to the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his State of the Union message, President Obama offered his assessment of domestic and foreign policy initiatives in his first year of office. Here is an examination of some of the points he raised:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In defending his economic policies, Mr. Obama said that ''because of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That number is drawn from a complex assessmentpublished two weeks ago by his Council of Economic Advisers, which puts the number at between 1.5 million and 2 million -- within the range, but a bit on the high side, of several recent economic estimates. It is a ballpark estimate, and it includes the ripple effects of tax cuts, near-zero interest rates and other policies. When the White House tried in October to tally actual jobs saved by $159 billion in stimulus spending, its estimate of 640,000 was widely criticized as flawed. The economic advisers' latest assessment, instead, provided several ''plausible'' ways of estimating the job revenues; the number Mr. Obama chose to cite in his speech was the highest of seven estimates in the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was based on comparing the number of people currently employed with projections that the council said economists would have made many months ago, using typical methods, before the stimulus package was passed. An alternative method used by the council, based on standard economic computer models, suggested the number was 1.7 million. The Congressional Budget Office's latest estimates ranged from a low case of 800,000 to a high of 2.4 million, and three private economic measures ranged from about 1 million to 1.5 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president appeared to have mischaracterized the Supreme Court's decision to overturn restrictions on corporate-paid political commercials by suggesting that the decision invited political advertisements by foreign companies, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests  -- including foreign corporations  -- to spend without limit in our elections,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a member of the majority in that decision, broke with the justices' usual decorum to openly dissent. He shook his head no and mouthed the words ''not true.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The majority opinion in the case, Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission, specifically disavowed a verdict on the question of foreign companies' political spending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We need not reach the question of whether the government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our nation's political process,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote. The court held that the First Amendment protected the right of American corporations to spend money on independent political commercials for or against candidates. Some analysts or observers have warned that the principle could open the door to foreign corporations as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama called for new legislation to prohibit foreign companies from taking advantage of the ruling to spend money to influence American elections. But he is too late; Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1996, which prohibits independent political commercials by foreign nationals or foreign companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama's claim that hundreds of Qaeda fighters and their affiliates have been killed or captured in the past year  -- far more than in 2008  -- is probably correct, although there are no precise figures to back up that contention. The president based his assertion largely on the fact that a growing NATO force in Afghanistan battled the Taliban in previously uncontested militant strongholds, and a re-energized Pakistani military reclaimed insurgent-held territory in Swat and South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama also directed the Central Intelligence Agency to accelerate armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda fighters and leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, and he approved American firepower and intelligence support of Yemeni </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda extremists in that country. His figures include fighters killed and captured not only by the United States, but also by any country receiving American support in combating violent extremism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These successes came at a steep price. In Afghanistan, American soldiers and Marines are dying faster than ever  -- twice the number were killed in 2009 as in 2008. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON--President Obama spent exactly nine minutes on national security issues in the first State of the Union speech of his presidency, promising Americans that he would fight terrorism and warning Iran that its leaders will face ''growing consequences'' if they continue to ignore international calls to rein in their nuclear ambitions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a speech dominated by domestic issues -- namely the economy, healthcare and jobs -- Mr. Obama spared little time for the subject of America's relations with the world. He made no mention at all of stalled Middle East peace proposals, nor did he mention the brewing turmoil between the United States and its biggest global economic rival, China over internet freedom. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, the only mention he made of China was when he cast Beijing in the role of economic threat to the United States. For instance, Mr. Obama said there was no reason why Europe and China should have faster trains than the United States. He said that China isn't waiting to revamp its economy (nor India or Germany).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These nations aren't playing for second place,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.'' He pledged to double American exports over the next five years, through a National Export Initiative, but offered few details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The President made glancing references to the two wars which he inherited--and in both cases, promised that American troops will soon come home. ''We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Make no mistake: this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama issued no challenges to any foreign leaders, continuing his break from his predecessor, President Bush, who often used State of the Union speeches to delineate the differences between America and its international foes. Rather, Mr. Obama struck a more conciliatory tone on national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He seemed to offer an olive branch to Republican critics at home who have accused him of putting civil liberties ahead of American security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I am not interested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He urged Americans to ''put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent weeks, Republicans have stepped up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the administration's decision to try some terror suspects in civilian courts, and about the intelligence breakdowns preceding the failed airline bombing on Christmas Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, the President defended his counterterrorism record, saying that ''hundreds'' of militants from al Qaeda and affiliated groups who had been killed or captured over the past year--''far more than in 2008.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has accelerated the C.I.A.'s campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which top administration officials credit with killing off several top Qaeda planners, including Saleh al-Somali, who was killed in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White House and intelligence officials argue that al Qaeda's ranks inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been depleted, one reason that the terror group's affiliate in Yemen has in recent months taken a more active role in striking against the west. American officials believe that Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab, the Nigerian man arrested after the failed Christmas Day bombing, was working with operatives from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the affiliate group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has dispatched special operations troops to Yemen, and has given Yemeni officials intelligence information in recent weeks that has led to several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in the country. On Wednesday, one senior administration official estimated that 20 percent of the 300 to 400 al Qaeda operatives in Yemen have been killed over the last several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Iran, where the administration would like to get an economics sanctions package through the Security Council but is facing the usual objections from China in particular, Mr. Obama, again, had little to say. He opted simply to call Iran's Islamist regime ''more isolated.'' He warned: ''As Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: they too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official and foreign policy expert, said Wednesday night that he ''can't recall a state of the union that devoted less time or attention to foreign policy issues than this one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rothkopf, author of a book about the National Security Council, said that Mr. Obama has gauged that Americans right now are ''wounded and looking inward.''</SPAN></P>

The target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a compound in the Mamad Khel area of North Waziristan, the officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four Arab and two ethnic Uzbek fighters were killed, along with local militants, a security official said. Four militants were wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region have increased significantly since the Dec. 30 suicide bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, which borders </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Waziristan region. Seven Americans and a Jordanian were killed in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say North Waziristan is the main haven for militants from Al Qaeda and for the Afghan Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. He is closely allied with the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, who claimed responsibility for the Khost bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are controversial in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose officials argue publicly that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violate their sovereignty. Privately those officials do not oppose the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which many United States officials say have been effective in weakening the Taliban and Al Qaeda by killing many of their senior leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, at least 16 people were killed Saturday and dozens wounded in a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a checkpoint in the main market of Khar, the capital of the Bajaur tribal area, according to local residents and Pakistani news reports.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani and American officials said Sunday that they were increasingly convinced that the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief domestic enemy and the man behind the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a C.I.A. base in Afghanistan in December, had died from wounds sustained in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military, which mounted a major offensive against Mr. Mehsud and his loyalists in South Waziristan last fall, said it could not confirm the report. But state-run television set off a storm of speculation on Sunday when it reported that Mr. Mehsud had died. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Government officials in the capital, Islamabad, and Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province, said they believed that there was a good chance Mr. Mehsud was dead, though they could not offer proof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Obama administration official in Washington said intelligence reports over the weekend came close to a definitive conclusion -- about 90 percent certainty -- that Mr. Mehsud had died from wounds suffered in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Jan. 14 and that he was believed to have been buried in a tribal plot in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has been eager to retaliate against Mr. Mehsud after he claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of a C.I.A. base in southeast Afghanistan in late December that killed five agency officers and two private contractors, the deadliest assault against the spy agency in more than 20 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said they hoped the death of Mr. Mehsud would signal their resolve against the Taliban groups and their Qaeda allies who have used </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would be a serious blow, they said, coming at a time when the group has been battered by an escalation in American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the offensive by the Pakistani military that has disrupted their operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would not necessarily be a decisive one, however, or one certain to slow the blistering insurgency that the Pakistani Taliban have waged against the Pakistani state with the backing of Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Baitullah Mehsud, Hakimullah Mehsud's predecessor, was killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last August, the Pakistani Taliban were briefly roiled by a succession struggle. But the group resumed its suicide bombings, initiating even more sophisticated and numerous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed more than 500 Pakistanis since October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death of Hakimullah Mehsud, if true, would probably set off a new power struggle. But the organizational setback could be short-lived, as the two men in line to take over from him -- Wali ur-Rehman, known as the chief military strategist, and Qari Hussain, the chief instructor on suicide bombers -- are considered tough operators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hussain, who trained with a sectarian group, Lashkar-e-Jangvi, is probably favored by Al Qaeda over Mr. Rehman, experts on the Pakistani Taliban say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though many government and intelligence officials have said in the past week, and repeated Sunday, that they believed the Taliban leader was probably dead, a cautionary tone weighed on the reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior Pakistani officials, including the interior minister, Rehman Malik, announced that Hakimullah Mehsud, who was about 28, was dead last September. He was reported to have been killed in a succession fight with Mr. Rehman, but later surfaced and went on to claim the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the C.I.A. base in Afghanistan on Dec. 30, Hakimullah Mehsud appeared in a pre-recorded video alongside the Jordanian double agent who carried out the suicide mission, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men claimed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was retribution for the death of Baitullah Mehsud, making Hakimullah Mehsud a prime target of the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, which was stepped up through January to include more than a dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The competing versions about whether Mr. Hakimullah is alive or not center on the aftermath of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Jan. 14, when he was in the village of Shaktoi, a Taliban stronghold, in South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Taliban released two tapes of Mr. Hakimullah's voice to refute assertions that he had been killed. On one of the tapes Mr. Hakimullah could be heard giving the date, Jan. 17, cited as evidence that he had survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But intelligence agents and local tribesmen said Mr. Hakimullah was badly wounded and was believed to have been taken to Orakzai, an area close to South Waziristan where his wife's relatives live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to Azmat Khan, the journalist for the state-owned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Television Corp. who reported Mr. Hakimullah's death on Sunday, he died of injuries from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two tribal leaders had told him of the death, and described a funeral that took place in the early hours of Jan. 27 in the village of Tajaka in the Mamozai area of Orakzai. Mr. Khan who is based in Kohat, close to Orakzai, said he did not see the body or attend the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A member of the Pakistani Taliban, a fighter who was close to Mr. Mehsud's predecessor said in a telephone interview on Sunday night that there were ''indications'' that Mr. Mehsud had died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighter said that Mr. Mehsud had indeed been moved to Orakzai in the past week for medical treatment, and that it was possible that he had died, given the severity of his injuries and the scarcity of medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hakimullah Mehsud was specifically chosen by Al Qaeda to succeed Baitullah Mehsud because he was considered most allied to it. His role in facilitating the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the American base in Afghanistan showed how much trust Al Qaeda had vested in him, American officials said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's top intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday that Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made it a high priority to attempt a large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil within the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assessment by Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, was much starker than his view last year, when he emphasized the considerable progress in the campaign to debilitate Al Qaeda and said that the global economic meltdown, rather than the prospect of a major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the ''primary near-term security concern of the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At Tuesday's hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Mr. Blair to assess the possibility of an attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States in the next three to six months. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He replied, ''The priority is certain, I would say'' -- a response that was reaffirmed by the top officials of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Citing a recent wave of terrorist plots, including the failed Dec. 25 attempt to blow up an airliner as it approached Detroit, Mr. Blair and other intelligence officials told a Senate panel that Al Qaeda had adjusted its tactics to more effectively </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American targets domestically and abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The biggest threat is not so much that we face an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like 9/11,'' said Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director. ''It is that Al Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways that oftentimes make it difficult to detect.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the C.I.A. continues its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at Qaeda operatives in  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the officials also said that the network's splinter groups in Yemen and Somalia were taking on more  importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Blair began his annual threat testimony before Congress by saying that the threat of a crippling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on telecommunications and other computer networks was growing, as an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies had ''severely threatened'' the sometimes fragile systems undergirding the country's information infrastructure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Malicious cyberactivity is occurring on an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication,'' he told the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His emphasis on the threat points up the growing concerns among American intelligence officials about the potentially devastating results  of a coordinated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the nation's technology apparatus, sometimes called a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that the surge in cyberattacks, including the penetration of Google's servers from inside China, was a ''wake-up call'' for those who dismissed the threat of computer warfare. ''Sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private-sector networks, undermining confidence in our information systems, and in the very information these systems were intended to convey,'' Mr. Blair said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another departure from last year's testimony, Mr. Blair appeared alongside other top intelligence officials, including the heads of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Last year, the intelligence director sat alone before the committee, a partly symbolic gesture intended to demonstrate the authority of the director, whose office has been criticized for commanding little power over America's 16 intelligence agencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At times, the senators seemed more interested in debating one another than in hearing testimony from witnesses. Midway through the hearing, partisan bickering broke out about whether terrorist suspects ought to be tried in civilian courts and whether the man charged as the Dec. 25 bomber should have been given Miranda rights that could protect him against self-incrimination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As  senators traded barbs, the intelligence officials stared stonily ahead or shuffled their notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The intelligence chiefs also raised warnings about nuclear proliferation, particularly focusing on Iran and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Blair said that Iran ''has the scientific, technical and industrial capacity to eventually produce nuclear weapons,'' and that the discovery of a secret enrichment plant near Qum heightened suspicions about Iran's intentions to build a nuclear bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he said that Tehran was following a ''cost-benefit approach'' to its nuclear decision-making and that it remained unclear whether Iran's leadership would make a political calculation to begin producing weapons-grade uranium, allowing other nations  to ''influence'' that decision through diplomatic steps. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of three American soldiers in a Taliban suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday lifted the veil on United States military assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the authorities here would like to keep quiet and the Americans, as the donors, chafe at not receiving credit for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The soldiers were among at least 60 to 100 members of a Special Operations team that trains </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> paramilitary Frontier Corps in counterinsurgency techniques, including intelligence gathering and development assistance. The American service members are from the Special Operations Command of Adm. Eric T. Olson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least 12 other American service members have been killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since Sept. 11, 2001, in hotel bombings and a plane crash, according to the United States Central Command, but these were the first killed as part of the Special Operations training, which has been under way for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That training has been acknowledged only gingerly by both the Americans and the Pakistanis, but has deliberately been kept low-key so as not to trespass onto Pakistani sensitivities about sovereignty, and not to further inflame high anti-American sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even though the United States calls </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an ally, the country, unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, has not allowed American combat forces to operate here, a point that is stressed by the Pentagon and the Pakistani Army, the most powerful institution in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the Central Intelligence Agency operates what has become the main American weapon in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> armed with missiles that have struck with increasing intensity against militants with the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the lawless tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American soldiers were probably made targets as a result of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Syed Rifaat Hussain, professor of international relations at Islamabad University. ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems a payback for the mounting frequency of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Professor Hussain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the American soldiers were the targets, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raised the question of whether the Taliban had received intelligence or cooperation from within the Frontier Corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three soldiers were killed, and two other service members wounded, in the region of Lower Dir, which is close to the tribal areas. According to police officials in the region, the armored vehicle in which they were traveling was hit by a suicide bomber driving a car. Earlier reports from Pakistani security officials said the soldiers had been killed by a roadside explosive device. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To disguise themselves in a way that is common for Western men in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the American soldiers were dressed in traditional Pakistani garb of baggy trousers and long tunic, known as shalwar kameez, according to a Frontier Corps officer. They also wore local caps that helped cover their hair, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their armored vehicle was equipped with electronic jammers sufficient to block remotely controlled devices and mines, the officer said. Vehicles driven by the Frontier Corps were placed in front and behind the Americans as protection, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the Taliban bomber was able to penetrate their cordon. In all 131 people were wounded, most of them girls who were students at a high school adjacent to the site of the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Lower Dir police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The soldiers were en route to the opening of a girls school that had been rebuilt with American money, the United States Embassy said in a statement. The school was destroyed by the Taliban last year as they swept through Lower Dir and the nearby Swat Valley, where a battle raged for months between the Pakistani Army and the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban called reporters hours after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Americans and claimed that his group was responsible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army currently occupies Swat, and in an effort to strengthen the civilian institutions there and in Dir, some of the American service members on the Special Operations team have been quietly working on development projects, an American official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The presence of the American military members in an area known to be threaded with Taliban militants would also raise questions, said Khalid Aziz, a former chief secretary of the North-West Frontier Province, which includes Swat and Dir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Aziz said it was odd that American soldiers would go to such a volatile area where Taliban militants were known to be prevalent even though the Pakistani security forces insisted that they had been flushed out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The usual practice for development work in Dir and Swat called for Pakistani aid workers or paramilitary soldiers to visit the sites, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans' involvement in training Frontier Corps recruits in development assistance was little known until Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People are going to be very suspicious,'' said Mr. Aziz, who is now involved in American assistance projects elsewhere. ''There is going to be big blowback in the media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American development official said that encouraging the Frontier Corps to become expert in humanitarian aid was an important part of the trainers' counterinsurgency curriculum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last summer, for example, the American military trainers helped distribute food and water in camps for the more than one million people displaced from the Swat Valley by the fighting, the official said. But that American assistance, too, was kept quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 500,000-strong Pakistani Army led by Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the standard-bearer of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strong sense of nationalism, is resistant to the appearance of overt military assistance, least of all from the unpopular Americans, that would make the army look less than self-reliant on the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the last several years, as the Qaeda-backed insurgents increased their hold on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and used their base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, the United States military asked for permission for combat soldiers to operate in the tribal zone, according to American officials. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rebuffed the requests, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether American soldiers are based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is often raised by Pakistani politicians, students and average Pakistanis, many of them suspicious of American motives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question of the presence of American soldiers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also prompted by the fact that the American military provides important equipment to the Pakistani Army, including F-16 fighter jets, Cobra </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters and howitzers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Capt. Jack Hanzlik, a spokesman for the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., said 12 other service members had been killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since Sept. 11, 2001. The three soldiers who died Wednesday had been assigned to a Special Operations command in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But he said they were not commandos from the elite Delta Force or Special Forces, also known as the Green Berets. The United States has about 200 military service members in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Captain Hanzlik said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three names of the soldiers killed were not released Wednesday because United States military officials were still notifying the next of kin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House pushed back Sunday against Republican criticism of its approach to terrorism, calling it ''not anchored in reality'' as a national security debate that was largely muted in recent years roared back to center stage with an angry intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a week of sustained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and a host of Congressional Republicans, President Obama and his aides argued that they were handling terror suspects much as the previous administration did, dismissing Republican complaints as politically motivated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The most important thing for the public to understand is we're not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them all through 9/11,'' Mr. Obama told CBS News on Sunday. ''They prosecuted 190 folks in these Article Three courts,'' he added, referring to civilian courts. ''Got convictions. And those folks are in maximum security prisons right now. And there have been no escapes.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, was more scathing about the Republican criticism. ''Quite frankly, I am tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football,'' Mr. Brennan, a longtime Central Intelligence Agency officer, who also worked under President George W. Bush, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''They are going out there, they are unknowing of the facts, and they are making charges and allegations that are not anchored in reality.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House rebuttal came a day after Ms. Palin drew rousing applause at a convention of Tea Party activists by declaring that ''we need a commander in chief, not a professor of law.'' Appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Ms. Palin followed up her critique of Mr. Obama by attacking what she called ''this perceived lackadaisical approach that he has to dealing with the terrorists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The exchanges reflected a stark escalation in rhetoric in recent weeks as the uneasy truce on terrorism that existed at the beginning of the Obama presidency evaporated. The Republican critique of Mr. Obama as a Miranda-reading, soft-on-terror president attempts to tap into an historic vulnerability for Democrats, with midterm elections on the horizon and the president already on the defensive on a health care bill and the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Strategists in both parties said the argument had gained new traction with the attempted Christmas Day bombing of an airliner, the missed deadline for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the collapse of the plan for a trial in New York of the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Democrats worried that Mr. Obama was losing control of the issue politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Terrorism has really become an issue again,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, a former president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's jumped to a much higher level because of the Christmas bomber that scared the willies out of people.'' And, he added, ''for the most part, the narrative has been taken out of the White House's hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans said they were seeing growing alarm after a year of Mr. Obama's policies. ''People suspended judgment and wanted to let him play his hand,'' Karl Rove, the former adviser to Mr. Bush, said of the president. But the Christmas Day bombing attempt ''has caused doubts about how he is handling this to bubble to the surface.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans have criticized the decision to charge Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in the Christmas Day plot as a civilian and, after a short period of interrogation, read him his Miranda rights. Mr. Brennan said Sunday that he spoke with four Republicans on Christmas night and told them that Mr. Abdulmutallab ''was in F.B.I. custody'' and cooperating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brennan said the Republicans, Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Christopher Bond of Missouri, and Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, should have understood that ''F.B.I. custody'' meant reading Miranda rights in a civilian process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''None of those individuals raised any concerns with me at that point,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''They didn't say, 'Is he going into military custody?' 'Is he going to be Mirandized?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spokesmen for the four Republicans said Sunday that the conversations with Mr. Brennan had been brief and went into no detail. They also noted that the nation's top intelligence, homeland security and counterterrorism officials were not consulted before the decision to treat Mr. Abdulmutallab as a civilian defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Brennan never told me of any plans to Mirandize the Christmas Day bomber,'' Mr. Bond said in a statement. ''If he had, I would have told him the administration was making a mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said, ''Instead of attempting to dodge responsibility, John Brennan and this administration should focus on fixing the near-catastrophic intelligence breakdown that failed to prevent this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his interview, Mr. Obama rejected the Republican version of Mr. Abdulmutallab's interrogation.  ''What happened was he clammed up, and after we had obtained actionable intelligence from him, that's when the F.B.I. folks on the ground then read him his Miranda rights,'' he said. ''But keep in mind, Richard Reid was read his Miranda rights five minutes after he was arrested, under the previous administration,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to the man who tried to blow up a plane with a shoe bomb in December 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Some of the same critics of our approach have been employing this policy for years,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has preserved much of Mr. Bush's counterterrorism strategy. He not only continued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against terrorist cells in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but he also escalated them. American troop levels in Afghanistan are tripling on his watch. He kept the surveillance program, military commissions and rendition authority he inherited, and he plans to continue holding some detainees without charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But where Mr. Obama has veered away from Bush-era policies, he has drawn sharp criticism -- most notably, the decisions to close Guantanamo and ban harsh interrogation techniques, investigate allegations of past interrogation abuses by C.I.A. officers and put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed on trial in civilian court in New York City for orchestrating the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The handling of detainee issues is going to be a huge, huge issue in the period ahead,'' said Marc A. Thiessen, a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For six years,'' Mr. Thiessen added, ''the left has had a field day with this, running around saying we tortured people and comparing us to the Spanish Inquisition.'' Now, he said, the politics have turned. ''It's a huge vulnerability for Obama and the Democrats, and Republicans are starting to gather their courage and talking about this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats see the criticism as expedience more than courage, noting that under Mr. Bush, terrorists were charged in civilian court, read Miranda rights and given lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The one thing that's changed is there's now a Democratic president instead of a Republican president,'' said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. ''It's fairly obvious that a lot of the criticism is being driven by politics and not substance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans discovered the renewed power of terrorism in last month's special Senate election in Massachusetts. Neil Newhouse, the pollster for the Republican victor, Scott Brown, said voters responded to the way Mr. Brown framed the issue, supporting him 63 percent to 26 percent when told he favored charging suspected terrorists as enemy combatants in a military tribunal while his Democratic opponent would give them constitutional rights and a civilian trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This moved voters more than the health care issue did,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''The terrorism stuff resonated, and it wasn't just from the advertising we did.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has told the United States it wants a central role in resolving the Afghan war and has offered to mediate with Taliban factions who use its territory and have long served as its allies, American and Pakistani officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The offer, aimed at preserving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> influence in Afghanistan once the Americans leave, could both help and hurt American interests as Washington debates reconciling with the Taliban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, made clear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willingness to mediate at a meeting late last month at NATO headquarters with top American military officials, a senior American military official familiar with the meeting said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a departure from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> previous reluctance to approach the Taliban. The meeting included the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen; the head of Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus; and the commander of American and allied troops in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Pakistanis want to be part of discussions that could involve reconciliation,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> desire to work with the United States in an Afghanistan endgame is likely to be discussed when the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, visits Islamabad, this week. So far, the United States has been more eager to push </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight Taliban than to negotiate with them, and has not endorsed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new approach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani offer makes clear that any stable solution to the war will have to take into account Afghanistan's neighbors, in a region where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, India, China, Iran and others all jostle for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials familiar with General Kayani's thinking said that even as the United States adds troops to Afghanistan, he has determined that the Americans are looking for a fast exit. The impression, they said, was reinforced by President Obama's scant mention of the war in his State of the Union address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the Pakistanis can offer is their influence over the Taliban network of Jalaluddin and Siraj Haqqani, whose forces American commanders say are the most lethal battling American and NATO soldiers in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From their stronghold in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal area of North Waziristan, the Haqqanis exert sway over large parts of southern Afghanistan and have staged major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kabul, American officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They are close allies of Al Qaeda. But they also have long ties to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence agencies that have protected them inside Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In return for trying to rein in the Haqqanis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be looking for a friendly Afghanistan and for ways to stem the growing Indian presence there, Pakistani and American officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In briefings last week with reporters at his army headquarters, the usually reticent General Kayani repeated his offer at NATO to play a constructive role, while making it clear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was seeking broad influence in southern Afghanistan. The Haqqani network would be one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strongest levers to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said Washington was still debating the contours of any negotiated solution. But a baseline for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they said, would be for it to engineer a separation between the Haqqani network and the Qaeda leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the moment, the United States has been looking instead for military help from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to tamp down Taliban and Qaeda strength in southern Afghanistan, where the Haqqanis command an estimated 4,000 fighters, American military officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans have been pushing General Kayani to launch an offensive against the Haqqanis' base in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Jan. 26 NATO meeting with General Kayani, American military commanders reviewed the list of hardware -- MI-17 helicopters, ammunition for Cobra </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters, body armor, armored vehicles -- that has been put on a fast track to the Pakistani military as an inducement to take on the Haqqanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But General Kayani, who pleased the Americans with an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in South Waziristan last fall, was unmoved. ''There is no need at this point to start a steamroller operation in North Waziristan,'' he told reporters last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last month he took General McChrystal on a helicopter tour over the mountains of the Swat Valley, where Pakistani paratroopers landed last summer to flush out Taliban insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The message was that the Pakistani Army still regarded India as its primary enemy and was stretched too thin to open a new front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reluctance to take on the Haqqanis preserves them as both a prize to be delivered at the negotiating table and a potential asset for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in postwar Afghanistan, said Syed Rifaat Hussain, professor of international relations at Islamabad University, who is close to the Pakistani Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Haqqani is the guy we are banking on to regain lost influence in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Hussain said. ''When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says we are well positioned to help, that means the Haqqanis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One strand of thinking within the Obama administration calls for allowing the Pakistanis to keep the Haqqanis as part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sphere of influence in southern Afghanistan, but only if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces the Haqqanis to break with Al Qaeda and to push militants out of its areas, an American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That would be a tall order for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Hussain said. ''The question is, how much influence do we have over Haqqani?'' he said. ''We have influence but not controlling influence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since Qaeda leaders escaped Afghanistan in 2001, they have used </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to cement their ties to the Haqqanis and other militants, including the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A chilling example came on Dec. 30 when, according to American officials, the Haqqanis helped Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban stage a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a C.I.A. base in southern Afghanistan, killing seven Americans working for the agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Americans have escalated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan, with the help of intelligence provided by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a demonstration that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ability to shield the Haqqanis extends only so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani efforts to persuade the Haqqanis to break with Al Qaeda have not made much headway, according to Pakistani intelligence and military officials, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to talk about the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a Pakistani military official, the Pakistanis would first have to resolve where Qaeda fighters would go and whether they might be given safe passage to Yemen or another location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the Pakistani military works out the details of its negotiating stance on Afghanistan, Washington is taking notice, said Daniel Markey, senior fellow for South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The United States side is pretty worried about seeing a deal emerge that suits everyone other than us,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A local security official said the bombers -- one in a vehicle and one on foot -- attacked a police complex in the center of Bannu, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North-West Frontier Province, and a police station nearby. News reports  indicated that the second bomber struck as the authorities responded to the first explosion at the police compound. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A hospital official said nine of the dead were police officials and six were civilians, and that many of the injured were children. The Bannu chief of police, Iqbal Marwat, was critically wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Pakistani Taliban have been tied to previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The district of Bannu lies next to North Waziristan, a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban that has been the site of multiple </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against suspected militants have increased in the wake of a Dec. 30 suicide bombing of a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  came one day after a similar suicide bombing against tribal police officers on in the northwest tribal area of Khyber. At least 17 people -- 13 police officers among them  -- were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a convoy in that strategically important area, which serves as a supply route for American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Militants have struck security targets like police stations and convoys in retaliation for the Pakistani Army's recent offensive against Taliban forces near the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barack Obama knew that the snow clogging the capital would melt a lot sooner than Dick Cheney's heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But when he saw that Cheney was going on ABC's Sunday morning show with Jonathan Karl, he braved the ultimate lion's den. He took Jonathan Alter's advice in Newsweek and called the former vice president to set up a private meeting in the Oval Office, hoping to use any combination of diplomacy and tongue-lashing that would make Cheney quit calling him weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama invited Bob Gates to the Saturday summit. Gates, after all, had originally been brought in as defense secretary by W. to be a common-sense counterbalance to the batty Cheney.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president prides himself on winning over hostile audiences, but this challenge would give a peacock pause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three men sat before the fire in the Oval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: Look, Dick, you've called me out on various particulars. And I have no problem with that. That's politics. You thought Khalid Shaikh Mohammed should not be tried in New York City, and that's fine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And we both know that any blowhard can call me weak. But you're not just any blowhard, Dick. You were the architect of America's defense against terrorism. And when those folks sitting in a cave in Waziristan hear you chest-thumping, saying our guard is down, they think, ''Hey, this might be a good time to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You believe in the unitary executive. You believe that if the president says something is in the national security interest of the U.S., then it is. So I am the president now, and I'm telling you that you need to put a sock in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: What are you going to do about it, Hussein? Mirandize me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GATES: Dick, the president's right. When a former vice president calls a new president weak, it emboldens terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY (contemptuously looking at Gates with his one-sided smile): If you take the king's coin, you sing the king's song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: You keep saying there were no terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after 9/11, Dick. That's like saying that blimps were safe after the Hindenburg. I wouldn't have been caught flat-footed reading ''The Pet Goat'' to second graders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: No, you'd have been teaching a graduate seminar on ''The Pet Goat.'' Don't you Muslims eat pet goats? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA (shaking head in disgust): You have the audacity to say I'm ''pretending'' we're not at war. You let the Taliban regroup. I sent 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. I've quadrupled the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prisoners who returned to terrorism after being released from Gitmo did so under your watch. You released one of the terrorists behind the foiled Christmas Day plot into an art therapy program in Saudi Arabia. Nice work, Dr. Phil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: You're such a Nervous Nellie you can't even use the words ''war,'' ''win,'' ''terrorism,'' ''enemy combatant,'' ''Bomb Iran,'' ''Fire Eric Holder'' or ''Fire John Brennan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: You and W. liked Brennan well enough to put him in charge of the National Counterterrorism Center. And I didn't want an attorney general who was a rubber stamp on torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: The tea partiers agree with me about torture, and that's why you're already over, Mr. Charisma. First you lost Teddy Kennedy's seat. Now you've lost his kid. Scott Brown will wipe the floor with you in Pennsylvania and Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GATES: Speaking of Scott, the new 41,   why can't you be classy in retirement like the original 41, Dick?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: Scott's an All-American winner  -- Sarah Palin with better legs and less sarcasm. And the hair extensions make her seem even more phony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: Consensus, at last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: You, on the other hand, have about as much hair on your chest as a hairless Chihuahua.  Michelle has the biceps in this family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: Michelle is campaigning against obesity. You might listen up on that, Dick. At least the women in my family aren't Mini-Me's trash-talking about the commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY (growling): Liz and I are right! You're on the terrorist team!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GATES: Calm down, Dick. You don't want to end up in the hospital like poor Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: Joe Biden's going to end up in the hospital if he brags again that Iraq will ''be one of the greatest achievements'' of your administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: If I don't get re-elected, it will be because you ruined the country beyond even my ability to rescue it. Remember when you said deficits don't matter, Dick? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY: Stop whining, Mr. Radical Chic. You won't get a second term because you're letting America fall into second place. Put that in your teleprompter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA: Why don't you go help W. with Haiti instead of spewing paranoia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHENEY (stomping out): Is that your Indonesian birth certificate in the Oval vault? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GATES: So, that went well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have recently increased in the region, on the border with Afghanistan, which is the main hub of Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban faction led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose fighters are involved in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against NATO and American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sunday was a compound in the town of Mir Ali. The identity of those killed was not clear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military is currently involved in an offensive in South Waziristan, the base of the Pakistani Taliban, but is under increasing pressure from the United States to expand the offensive to North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials also believe that the top leadership of the Pakistani Taliban has fled the Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan and is currently hiding in the North. The Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility for the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, in December, killing eight people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have increased since then, and one last month is thought to have killed the leader of Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A missile believed to have been fired Thursday from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed the younger brother of a top militant commander in the North Waziristan tribal area, according to several Pakistani security and intelligence officials, residents in Waziristan and a friend of the commander's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militant commander, Sirajuddin Haqqani, appeared to have been the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Haqqani, who the Americans say operates from a base in North Waziristan, took over major responsibilities for the family's militant network in recent years from his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who has been reported to be ill. The Americans blame the Haqqani network for helping plan the suicide bombing against the C.I.A. base in Afghanistan in  December in which C.I.A. operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The brother, Mohammad Haqqani, was killed along with three others when their white station wagon was hit by a missile in Dande Darpakhel, a village in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan. Americans believe that Sirajuddin Haqqani is closely affiliated with Al Qaeda and that his network is the most potent one working against international forces in eastern and central Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dande Darpakhel is just  north of Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan, and is considered the main base of the Haqqani network and family. It has been a repeated target of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one of which was believed to have killed several members of the clan last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a family friend of the Haqqanis, Mohammad Haqqani was killed  on his way to see his brother, the commander. The family friend in the village said that Mohammad Haqqani, who was about 20, was not an active member of the militant network and that his brother had wanted him to pursue religious studies away from the area so he could lead a more normal life.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sirajuddin Haqqani has subcommanders threaded throughout eastern and southern Afghanistan. His fighters control Paktika, Paktia and Khost Provinces in Afghanistan, which lie close to North Waziristan and are also strong elsewhere, Pakistani security officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States is pressing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to act more aggressively against the Haqqani network, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has so far resisted; it considers the group more of an asset than a threat because it operates primarily in Afghanistan. It sees Mr. Haqqani and his control of large areas of Afghan territory as vital to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the jostling for influence that will pit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, India, Russia, China and Iran against one another in the Afghan arena after the Americans withdraw, Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is particularly eager to counter the growing influence of its archenemy, India, which is pouring $1.2 billion in aid into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haqqani has 4,000 to 12,000 Taliban fighters under his command. He is technically a member of the Afghan Taliban leadership based in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That leadership is headed by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former head of the Taliban regime. But Mr. Haqqani operates somewhat independently of those leaders inside Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intended for Mr. Haqqani came shortly after American and Pakistani security forces arrested Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a deputy to Mullah Omar, in a joint raid last month in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Two of the Taliban's shadow governors were later arrested on the information provided by Mullah Baradar, Pakistani officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has stepped up its use of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal area against suspected Taliban and Qaeda targets and have killed some of the top commanders in recent months. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are focusing on North Waziristan because of the presence of a large number of local and foreign fighters allied with Al Qaeda there and also because of the Pakistani government's reluctance to undertake an operation there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, last year while another one recently was aimed at his successor, Hakimullah Mehsud. The fate of Hakimullah Mehsud, whose network is believed to have played the leading role in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan against the C.I.A., is still shrouded in confusion, with conflicting reports about whether he is alive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When American and allied forces pushed into the Taliban stronghold of Marja, in southern Afghanistan, last week, they had the advantage of knowing where dozens of roadside bombs had already been planted. And when some troops came under fire, they called in help from a weapon that has quietly become one of the military's most versatile tools on the Afghan battlefield: the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has expanded quickly and virtually unnoticed in Afghanistan. The Air Force now flies at least 20 Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- twice as many as a year ago -- over vast stretches of hostile Afghan territory each day. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They are mostly used for surveillance, but have also carried out more than 200 missile and bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the last year, including 14 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near Marja in the last few days, newly released military records show. That is three times as many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the past year as in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have gotten far more attention and proved more controversial for their use in a country where the United States does not have combat forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There, they are run by the C.I.A., as opposed to the military, and the civilian casualties that they have caused as they have struck at leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, amid Pakistani sensitivities over sovereignty, have stoked anger and anti-Americanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in Afghanistan, a country with nearly 70,000 American troops, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have stealthily settled into an everyday role, and military commanders say they are a growing part of a counterinsurgency strategy that seeks to reduce civilian casualties. They expect to field more of them as 30,000 more American troops enter Afghanistan this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trying to bring down civilian deaths, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of the American-led forces in Afghanistan, has tightened the rules for airstrikes, especially by military jets, which usually drop larger bombs than the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and have less time to follow the targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can linger over an area with their video cameras gathering intelligence for as long as 20 hours, and then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without warning. The United Nations says it recorded no civilian deaths from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan last year. But because the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have mainly been used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> low-level Taliban fighters in remote places, it may be hard to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the start of 2009, the Predators and their larger cousins, the Reapers, have fired at least 184 missiles and 66 laser-guided bombs at militant suspects in Afghanistan, according to the records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That compared with what independent researchers believe to be 69 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the same period. The C.I.A. does not comment publicly on its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the flights increase, the military is also finding that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can offer continuous protection and a broad view of their surroundings that the Army and the Marines have long said they needed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The power behind it is more about the video downlink and the huge ability to bring information into the system,'' said Maj. Gen. Stephen P. Mueller of the Air Force, a top air commander in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given Afghanistan's mountainous terrain, having that steady bird's eye view ''means that our ground forces can get out and about amongst the population and into smaller units than you would typically think about,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the military was counting on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help create a safer environment and give the counterinsurgency campaign time to unfold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Mueller said the missile firings occurred on only a small fraction of the flights, which had expanded as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been shifted to Afghanistan from Iraq and new planes added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> typically came when troops were caught in firefights or the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came across people who appeared to be planting homemade bombs, the biggest source of allied casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The counterinsurgency strategy ''isn't about going out and finding those,'' he said. ''But when we do find them, we obviously do what's necessary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal recently told Congress that the intelligence from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other planes was ''extraordinarily effective'' in dealing with the broad mix of demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials said the Special Forces were using the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban leaders and bomb-making networks in eastern and southern Afghanistan, often by stacking two or three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over a compound to track everyone who came and went. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since last fall, the Predators and Reapers have also been massed over Marja, a farming community in the southern Helmand Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials said the remote-controlled planes had identified Taliban fighters, monitored their weapons storehouses and their routes in and out of the area, and mapped where they were planting roadside bombs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of that data was analyzed in the United States, where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pilots are stationed. But ground commanders also receive the video feeds on special laptops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew M. Exum, a former Army captain who is an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington policy group, said the video links were ''incredibly helpful'' in counterinsurgency operations in Iraq in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then the supply of the laptops has mushroomed, with the Predators and Reapers now supplying more than 400 hours of video a day to troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, the video is in such demand that the Air Force has added cameras on its fighters and bombers to provide an extra 100 to 120 hours of video per day. The Army and the Marines have smaller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including tiny models that soldiers toss like footballs to peer past hills. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the Reapers will soon carry 10 cameras instead of just one, and 30 by 2011, adding to the profusion of video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the figures released by the Air Force, the Predators and Reapers set off 219 missiles and bombs in Afghanistan in 2009 and 31 more so far this year. That compared with 183 in Afghanistan in 2008 and 74 in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The number of weapons fired in Iraq, where about 10 Predators still fly each day, dropped to 6 in 2009 from 77 in 2008 and 46 in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Predators can fire only Hellfire missiles, which have relatively small warheads. But the newer Reapers fly faster and also carry 500-pound bombs like the jets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P. W. Singer, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, cautioned that growing use of the bombs could increase the chances for civilian casualties. He said officers also had to keep in mind that ''not everyone digging by the side of the road is automatically an insurgent.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, he said, ''What we're seeing is something that was once abnormal becoming the new normal, not just in counterterrorism, but in warfare over all.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Inside a secret detention center in an industrial pocket of the Pakistani capital called I/9, teams of Pakistani and American spies have kept a watchful eye on a senior Taliban leader captured last month. With the other eye, they watch each other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. and its Pakistani counterpart, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, have a long and often tormented relationship. And even now, they are moving warily toward conflicting goals, with each maneuvering to protect its influence after the shooting stops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet interviews in recent days show how they are working together on tactical operations, and how far the C.I.A. has extended its extraordinary secret war beyond the mountainous tribal belt and deep into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sprawling cities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, C.I.A. operatives working with the ISI have carried out dozens of raids throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past year, working from bases in the cities of Quetta, Peshawar and elsewhere, according to Pakistani security officials. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The raids often come after electronic intercepts by American spy satellites, or tips from Pakistani informants -- and the spies from the two countries then sometimes drive in the same car to pick up their quarry. Sometimes the teams go on lengthy reconnaissance missions, with the ISI operatives packing sunscreen and neon glow sticks that allow them to identify their positions at night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Successful missions sometimes end with American and Pakistani spies toasting one another with Johnnie  Walker Blue Label whisky, a gift from the C.I.A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is well known, which is striking given that this is a covert war. But these on-the-ground activities have been shrouded in secrecy because the Pakistani government has feared the public backlash against the close relationship with the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In strengthening ties to the ISI, the C.I.A. is aligning itself with a shadowy institution that meddles in domestic politics and has a history of ties to violent militant groups in the region. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment for this article. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials in Washington and Islamabad agree that the relationship between the two spy services has steadily improved since the low point of the summer of 2008, when the C.I.A.'s deputy director traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to confront ISI officials with communications intercepts indicating that the ISI was complicit in the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spy agencies have built trust in part through age-old tactics of espionage: killing or capturing each other's enemies. A turning point came last August, when a C.I.A. missile killed the militant leader Baitullah Mehsud as he lay on the roof of his compound in South Waziristan, his wife beside him massaging his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud for more than a year had been responsible for a wave of terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Pakistani cities, and many inside the ISI were puzzled as to why the United States had not sought to kill him. Some even suspected he was an American, or Indian, agent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Mr. Mehsud is part of a joint war against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, where C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pound militants from the air as Pakistani troops fight them on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And yet for two spy agencies with a long history of mistrust, the accommodation extends only so far. For instance, when it comes to the endgame in Afghanistan, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes to play a significant role as a power broker, interviews with Pakistani and American intelligence officials in Islamabad and Washington reveal that the interests of the two sides remain far apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as the ISI breaks up a number of Taliban cells, officials in Islamabad, Washington and Kabul hint that the ISI's goal seems to be to weaken the Taliban just enough to bring them to the negotiating table, but leaving them strong enough to represent Pakistani interests in a future Afghan government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This contrasts sharply with the American goal of battering the Taliban and strengthening Kabul's central government and security forces, even if American officials also recognize that political reconciliation with elements of the Taliban is likely to be part of any ultimate settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions in the relationship surfaced in the days immediately after Mullah Baradar's arrest, when the ISI refused to allow C.I.A. officers to interrogate the Taliban leader. Americans have since been given access to the detention center. On Wednesday, Pakistani and Afghan officials meeting in Islamabad said that a deal was being worked out to transfer Mullah Baradar to Afghan custody, which could allow the Americans unrestrained access to him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides Mullah Baradar, several Taliban shadow governors and other senior leaders have been arrested inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A top American military officer in Afghanistan on Wednesday suggested that with the arrests, the ISI could be trying to accelerate the timetable for a negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't know if they're pushing anyone to the table, but they are certainly preparing the meal,'' the officer said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the three decades since the C.I.A. and the ISI teamed up to funnel weapons to Afghan militias fighting the Soviets, the two spy services have soldiered though a co-dependent, yet suspicious relationship. C.I.A. officers in Islamabad rely on the Pakistani spy service for its network of informants. But they are wary of the ISI's longstanding ties to militants like the Taliban, which Pakistani spies have seen as a necessary ally to blunt archrival India's influence in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ISI gets millions of dollars in United States aid from its American counterpart (which allowed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy service to develop a counterterrorism division), yet is suspicious that the Americans and the Indians might be playing their own ''double game'' against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Islamabad, officials are nervous about the intensification of the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in North Waziristan against the network run by Sirajuddin Haqqani, whom the ISI for years has used as a force to carry out missions in Afghanistan that serve Pakistani interests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C.I.A. officials believe that Mr. Haqqani's group played a role in the killing of seven Americans in Khost, Afghanistan, in late December, and since then have carried out more than a dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Haqqani network's enclave in North Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ISI, an institution feared by most Pakistanis, is used to getting its way. It meddles in domestic politics and in recent months has been suspected by Western embassies in Islamabad of planting anti-American stories in Pakistani newspapers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has also been criticized in reports by international human rights organizations of using brutal interrogation tactics against its prisoners, though the same could certainly be said of the C.I.A. in the period of 2002 to 2004. The annual human rights report of the State Department in 2007 said ''there were persistent reports that security forces, including intelligence services, tortured and abused persons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The head of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said in a recent briefing that it was doubtful that a centralized government would work in post-conflict Afghanistan, making it more important for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to continue to influence the Taliban in the years to come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result there remains a belief among American intelligence officials that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will never completely abandon the Taliban, and officials both in Washington and Kabul admit that they are almost completely in the dark about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> long-term strategy regarding the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have a better level of cooperation,'' said one top American official who met recently in Islamabad with General Kayani. ''How far that goes, I can't tell yet. We'll know soon whether this is cooperation, or a stonewall and kind of rope a dope.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As President Obama begins making final decisions on a broad new nuclear strategy for the United States, senior aides say he will permanently reduce America's arsenal by thousands of weapons. But the administration has rejected proposals that the United States declare it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons, aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's new strategy -- which would annul or reverse several initiatives by the Bush administration -- will be contained in a nearly completed document called the Nuclear Posture Review, which all presidents undertake. Aides said Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates will present Mr. Obama with several options on Monday to address unresolved issues in that document, which have been hotly debated within the administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First among them is the question of whether, and how, to narrow the circumstances under which the United States will declare it might use nuclear weapons -- a key element of nuclear deterrence since the cold war. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's decisions on nuclear weapons come as conflicting pressures in his defense policy are intensifying. His critics argue that his embrace of a new movement to eliminate nuclear weapons around the world is naive and dangerous, especially at a time of new nuclear threats, particularly from Iran and North Korea. But many of his supporters fear that over the past year he has moved too cautiously, and worry that he will retain the existing American policy by leaving open the possibility that the United States might use nuclear weapons in response to a biological or chemical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perhaps against a nation that does not possess a nuclear arsenal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is one of the central debates Mr. Obama must resolve in the next few weeks, his aides say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many elements of the new strategy have already been completed, according to senior administration and military officials who have been involved in more than a half-dozen Situation Room debates about it, and outside strategists consulted by the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As described by those officials, the new strategy commits the United States to developing no new nuclear weapons, including the nuclear bunker-busters advocated by the Bush administration. But Mr. Obama has already announced that he will spend billions of dollars more on updating America's weapons laboratories to assure the reliability of what he intends to be a much smaller arsenal. Increased confidence in the reliability of American weapons, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a speech in February, would make elimination of ''redundant'' nuclear weapons possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will be clear in the document that there will be very dramatic reductions -- in the thousands -- as relates to the stockpile,'' according to one senior administration official whom the White House authorized to discuss the issue this weekend. Much of that would come from the retirement of large numbers of weapons now kept in storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other officials, not officially allowed to speak on the issue, say that in back-channel discussions with allies, the administration has also been quietly broaching the question of whether to withdraw American tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, where they provide more political reassurance than actual defense. Those weapons are now believed to be in Germany, Italy, Belgium, Turkey and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the new document will steer the United States toward more non-nuclear defenses. It relies more heavily on missile defense, much of it arrayed within striking distance of the Persian Gulf, focused on the emerging threat from Iran. Mr. Obama's recently published Quadrennial Defense Review also includes support for a new class of non-nuclear weapons, called ''Prompt Global </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' that could be fired from the United States and hit a target anywhere in less than an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The idea, officials say, would be to give the president a non-nuclear option for, say, a large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the leadership of Al Qaeda in the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or a pre-emptive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an impending missile launch from North Korea. But under Mr. Obama's strategy, the missiles would be based at new sites around the United States that might even be open to inspection, so that Russia and China would know that a missile launched from those sites was not nuclear -- to avoid having them place their own nuclear forces on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the big question confronting Mr. Obama is how he will describe the purpose of America's nuclear arsenal. It is far more than just an academic debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some leading Democrats, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have asked Mr. Obama to declare that the ''sole purpose'' of the country's nuclear arsenal is to deter nuclear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''We're under considerable pressure on this one within our own party,'' one of Mr. Obama's national security advisers said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But inside the Pentagon and among many officials in the White House, Mr. Obama has been urged to retain more ambiguous wording -- declaring that deterring nuclear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the primary purpose of the American arsenal, not the only one. That would leave open the option of using nuclear weapons against foes that might threaten the United States with biological or chemical weapons or transfer nuclear material to terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any compromise wording that leaves in place elements of the Bush-era pre-emption policy, or suggests the United States could use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear adversary, would disappoint many on the left wing of his party, and some arms control advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Any declaration that deterring a nuclear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a 'primary purpose' of our arsenal leaves open the possibility that there are other purposes, and it would not reflect any reduced reliance on nuclear weapons,'' said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association. ''It wouldn't be consistent with what the president said in his speech in Prague'' a year ago, when he laid out an ambitious vision for moving toward the elimination of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's base has already complained in recent months that he has failed to break from Bush era national security policy in some fundamental ways. They cite, for example, his stepped-up use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones to strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected terrorists in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his failure to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by January as Mr. Obama had promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Obama ended financing last year for a new nuclear warhead sought by the Bush administration, the new strategy goes further. It commits Mr. Obama to developing no new nuclear weapons, including a low-yield, deeply-burrowing nuclear warhead that the Pentagon sought to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buried targets, like the nuclear facilities in North Korea and Iran. Mr. Obama, officials said, has determined he could not stop other countries from seeking new weapons if the United States was doing the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, some of Mr. Obama's critics in his own party say the change is symbolic because he is spending more to improve old weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the center of the new strategy is a renewed focus on arms control and nonproliferation agreements, which were largely dismissed by the Bush administration. That includes an effort to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was defeated during the Clinton administration and faces huge hurdles in the Senate, and revisions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close loopholes that critics say have been exploited by Iran and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's reliance on new, non-nuclear Prompt Global </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weapons is bound to be contentious. As described by advocates within the Pentagon and in the military, the new weapons could achieve the effects of a nuclear weapon, without turning a conventional war into a nuclear one. As a result, the administration believes it could create a new form of deterrence -- a way to contain countries that possess or hope to develop nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, without resorting to a nuclear option.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM -- Preparations for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Iran's nuclear program are as evident as ever: the introduction of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capable of flying hundreds of miles, the frequent open talk of a possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the distribution of new gas masks to the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But lately, the real action in Israel on the Iranian issue has been the parade of top American security officials. The chairman of the joint chiefs, the director of the  C.I.A. and the national security adviser have all just been here; the vice president arrives on Monday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Some have described it as a bear hug,'' a senior Israeli official said of the near-daily high-level meetings, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to express himself freely on a charged issue, as did three other top Israeli officials for this article. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All the visitors to Israel are sending us and the region a message: that Israel is not alone,'' said Ilan Mizrahi, a former head of Israel's National Security Council. ''That means that Israel will not pull the trigger without a lot of consideration and consultation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American decision to press Israel to hold its fire stems partly from war game exercises in both countries that have raised complex questions about how effective a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be, how Iran would react and when it would be clear that a nuclear line had been crossed in Iran. The officials say this is the time to try to put tougher sanctions against Tehran into place. And Israel is going along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No Israeli prime minister wants to make the decision to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran,'' commented a former official closely involved in these discussions. ''And for Iran to go nuclear on Obama's watch would be seen as a colossal failure. There is a common interest to make sanctions work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, the Israeli-American relationship has actually been improving lately over Iran. Both countries still find it useful to note that Israel is preparing for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that its government includes some real hawks. This is a point American officials made to China recently  to persuade it to join the sanctions regime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But few believe an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is imminent. Intelligence cooperation between the United States and Israel is intensifying, and assessments regarding Iranian intentions and capabilities are closer than they were during the Bush administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A year ago, the differences were starker. The Obama administration wanted to engage Iran in talks; the Israelis viewed that as a waste of time that would give Tehran greater opportunity to enrich uranium while stringing along President Obama  with promises of diplomatic breakthroughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The troubled June election in Iran, the violent repression of dissent there and the Iranian rejections of Western offers to enrich uranium outside Iran altered Washington's views. ''We have seen a real change in the administration,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''They now see Iran as riper for tough sanctions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israeli officials agree that the Iranian  government and economy are weak and that harsh sanctions could pressure it into changing its nuclear policy. But which sanctions? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The question now is how much the desire for international consensus will dilute the sanctions,'' one senior official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States is aiming at a broad coalition, including Russia and China, signing onto a United Nations resolution. That would mean less severe sanctions than those Israel would seek to impose. Many Israelis would like to single out Iran's energy sector because penalties of that kind are seen as more likely to deal a severe economic blow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Israelis have made recent high-level visits to China and Russia in an effort to bring officials there aboard. In addition, Israeli officials are due in Washington next week to urge Congress to take a tough unilateral stand on the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has not backed sanctions on Iran's energy sector for fear of alienating ordinary Iranians, including the country's struggling opposition movement. But Senator John Kerry, Democrat  of Massachusetts and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was here this week  and spoke of the importance of tough sanctions. ''I believe that the most biting and important sanctions would be those on the energy side,'' he said at a news conference after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the challenges of forging a coherent joint policy is that developments on the ground are not static. Recently, Iran said it had started to enrich uranium up to 20 percent, a huge step from its current enrichment of 4 percent. This would put it much closer to the capacity to enrich at bomb-making levels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran attended a summit meeting in the Syrian capital with the leaders of Syria and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. His verbal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Israel were harsher than usual. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel says it is watching with enormous concern. Its officials say they do not want to be lured into what could be an Iranian trap: a confrontation in Lebanon or Syria aimed at diverting the world's attention from Iran. At the same time, they worry about weapons being smuggled into Lebanon and to Hamas in Gaza, and feel they may need to act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States hopes to prevent any slide into armed confrontation by increasing its diplomatic relations with Syria and appealing to President Bashar al-Assad to stop transferring arms to Hezbollah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, for all the agreement between Jerusalem and Washington, there remains a significant difference. It emerged last month when Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, was asked  at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  how cooperation was going between Israel and the United States on Iran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''From America, when you look at a nuclear Iran, you already have, just besides allies like France and the U.K., a nuclear Russia, nuclear China, nuclear India, nuclear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' he replied. ''North Korea is going toward turning nuclear. So probably from this corner of the world, it doesn't change the scene dramatically. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''From a closer distance, in Israel, it looks like a tipping point of the whole regional order.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, as a top Israeli official put it afterward: ''For the Americans, Iran is a strategic threat. For us, it's an existential one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether that difference becomes more significant in the coming year will help determine whether Israel breaks ranks with Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Leading Congressional Republicans are arguing that getting tough on terrorism means trying all foreign terrorism suspects before military commissions. But national security officials who served in the Bush administration say that taking away the criminal justice option would weaken the government's hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former counterterrorism officials are warning that the political debate has lost touch with the pragmatic advantages of keeping both the civilian and military systems available.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This rush to military commissions is based on premises that are not true,'' said John B. Bellinger III, a top legal adviser to the National Security Council and the State Department under President George W. Bush. ''I think it is neither appropriate nor necessary to limit terrorism cases to either military commissions alone or federal trials alone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the problems with a commissions-only policy, they say, are that some nations will not extradite terrorism suspects or provide evidence to the United States except for civilian trials; federal courts offer a greater variety of charges for use in pressuring a defendant to cooperate; military commission rules do not authorize a judge to accept a guilty plea from a defendant in a capital case; and the military system is legally untested, so any guilty verdict is vulnerable to being overturned on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kenneth L. Wainstein, who was assistant attorney general for national security in the Bush administration, said, ''Denying yourself access to one system in favor of the other could be counterproductive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I see the benefit of having both systems available,'' Mr. Wainstein said. ''That's why I applauded the Obama administration when, despite expectations to the contrary, they decided to retain military commissions. It's good to have flexibility.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters of military commissions contend that the foreign terrorists are enemy combatants who should not be treated like common criminals. They argue that critics are exaggerating any problems with commissions while overlooking their advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Republican line on military commissions has hardened after an outcry over the administration's decision to send to a civilian court the cases of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, accused of planning the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is accused of trying to blow up a Detroit-bound jet on Christmas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservatives, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, have sought to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Obama as soft on terrorism and unwilling to treat Al Qaeda as a wartime enemy rather than a criminal target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Obama has undertaken several hard-line policies in national security matters -- including sending more troops to Afghanistan, increasing missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on militants from Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continuing to imprison some detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without trials and using military commissions to prosecute some terrorism suspects. Those policies, which have outraged some civil libertarians, have left the administration's willingness to handle other terrorism cases in civilian courts as a rare remaining opportunity to try to draw a sharp political line between the Obama approach and that of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has proposed a deal with the White House in which the Sept. 11 trial would be moved to a military commission and the administration would support new legislation clarifying rules for handling detainees, including when they would face civilian or military trials. In exchange, he has offered to provide some Republican support for closing the military prison at Guantanamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Graham increasingly seems to stand alone within his party in keeping the door open to using some civilian trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week the party's 2008 presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, joined with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, to file legislation that would ban civilian trials for foreign terrorism suspects, including those arrested inside the United States. Other Republicans, including the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have echoed that view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But national security officials from both the Bush and Obama administrations say such a ban would create major obstacles to swift punishment of terrorism suspects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For instance, many European allies, including Britain, have been willing to extradite terrorism suspects only if they faced regular criminal trials, not military commissions. In some cases, extradition treaties require criminal trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush administration repeatedly agreed to guarantee criminal trials in order to persuade European countries to extradite terrorism suspects. Currently, at least a half-dozen such suspects are awaiting extradition from Britain and the Netherlands, including two men sought in the 1998 East African embassy bombings and a Somali citizen accused of recruiting young Minnesota men to fight for the al-Shabaab militant group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Current and former officials who want to preserve the option of civilian trials note that prosecutors routinely use a broad array of charges against terrorism defendants or their friends and families: obstruction of justice, false statements to investigators, passport and immigration fraud, firearms and arms trafficking offenses, and various computer and finance-related offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one recent major terrorism case, prosecutors coaxed Najibullah Zazi, accused of plotting to set off bombs on the New York City subway, to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators in part by indicting his father for obstruction of justice and threatening similar charges against his mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such charges against relatives could not be brought in the military system. But proponents of the military commissions system argue that military prosecutors could gain such leverage anyway by working with civilian prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters of the McCain-Lieberman proposal rebut other criticisms of the measure. They say that because Congress overhauled military commission rules last year to increase defendants' rights, the United States might be able to persuade foreign countries to extradite suspects to military tribunals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even though commissions do not provide for guilty pleas in capital cases, the supporters say, a defendant could stipulate to the military court during a brief trial that he committed an offense, accomplishing much the same goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Juan C. Zarate, who served as deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism to Mr. Bush from 2005 to 2009, does see value in the military tribunals. But he still argued that the government would hamstring itself by outlawing civilian terrorism trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We shouldn't inadvertently handcuff ourselves by taking this tool completely out of our tool kit,'' Mr. Zarate said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- With American troops pouring into insurgent strongholds in Afghanistan and the United States succeeding in killing insurgent leaders with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Obama administration is beginning to consider whether it has gained the upper hand sufficiently to justify an effort to begin talks with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama met with his war cabinet on Friday, and the issue of reconciling with the Taliban is gaining traction, even as administration officials debate whether the time is right. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior administration official pointed to recent successes by American and Pakistani forces in capturing and interrogating senior Taliban leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In addition, administration officials have sought to maintain a full-court press to persuade their Pakistani counterparts to keep attacking Taliban operatives, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, and Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have all traveled to the region recently to try to keep the pressure on both Afghan and Pakistani officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is now more a question of 'when' than a question of 'if,' '' the administration official said, when asked about the idea of reconciliation talks with senior Taliban officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another official, who like the senior administration official spoke on condition of anonymity because internal administration discussions were still at an early stage, said, ''There's been a lot of energy applied to the reconciliation issue in the last few weeks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But both officials added that, for now, there are no plans for reaching out soon to high-ranking Taliban leaders. That effort, they said, is likely to wait until after the United States takes on Taliban insurgents in Kandahar in what is expected to be the next major military offensive in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operation in Kandahar, the spiritual heart of the Taliban, is expected to be far more difficult than the recent offensive in Marja. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Urban warfare is a lot more complicated than when you're going into a hamlet like Marja,'' said Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress. ''The real test is Kandahar.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates, traveling in Afghanistan this week, said that despite the success of the Marja offensive, it was too early to expect reconciliation with some senior Taliban members, cautioning not to get ''too impatient.'' He said that Taliban leaders would not be interested until ''they see that the likelihood of their being successful has been cast into serious doubt,'' adding, ''My guess is they're not at that point yet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The momentum behind reconciliation got a major boost this week from Britain, the key American ally in Afghanistan. In a speech in Boston, the British foreign minister, David Miliband, called on President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to make as concerted an effort to reach out to disaffected Taliban leaders as British and American troops are making to integrate lower-level Taliban soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Without a genuine effort to understand and ultimately address the wider concerns which fuel the insurgency,'' Mr. Miliband said, ''it will be hard to convince significant numbers of combatants that their interests will be better served by working with the government than by fighting against it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The issue -- brought up by Mr. Obama himself -- was discussed during the 90-minute session in the White House on Friday, administration officials said. But no decisions were made. Participants included General Jones, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Admiral Mullen, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAKEEN, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- From a forward base in the bare brown foothills of the soaring mountains of South Waziristan, Pakistani soldiers fired artillery at insurgents sheltering in scrub across the valley. Smoke blotted the sky as the soldiers set ablaze houses once used by the Taliban to hide caches of heavy weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Makeen bazaar, where the former leader of the Pakistani militants, Baitullah Mehsud, was once king, the army has flattened the jerry-built stores, including the ice cream parlor, scotching any idea of easy return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here in the heartland of the Pakistani Taliban, the army has fought for five months to claw back territory from its indigenous enemy. A rare trip under military escort revealed that the battle had turned into a grinding test of wills with no neat resolution in sight. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army has, at least for the moment, gained the upper hand by taking the war to the Taliban in these barren mountains rather than retreating behind successive peace deals, as it once did. But it is not claiming victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The terrorists are nowhere and everywhere,'' Lt. Col. Nisar Mughal said as he looked out on a landscape devoid of people, crops, animals or any sign of normal life. ''This is a strange kind of warfare. We can't say the area is completely sanitized. We are hunting them, killing them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud and his men, allies of Al Qaeda, used this area over the past few years to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pakistani cities and military installations with a ferocious onslaught of suicide bombings and commando raids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most have now fled to North Waziristan, or to other parts of the tribal areas and to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities, leaving behind small bands of dedicated guerrillas. They continue to inflict casualties on the army with ambushes and sniper fire in a region where the British tried but failed to subdue the tribes during their colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States, a long-distance participant and a keen cheerleader in the current Pakistani campaign, killed Mr. Mehsud in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August and appears to have killed his successor, Hakimullah Mehsud, in another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in January. But the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continue, as evident in the bombings that killed more than 40 people in Lahore on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington has sent extra artillery, helicopters, body armor, radio sets and even surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ground war. During a recent visit Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged $55 million to upgrade roads in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In return, the Obama administration would like the Pakistani military to pursue a full-scale offensive in North Waziristan against the Afghan Taliban, who use the area to launch operations against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, and who serve as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proxies against Indian interests there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, the chief of the Pakistani army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has made clear that India remains </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prime enemy, despite the persistent insurgent threat, and that the army has its hands full with the South Waziristan campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a fight that his nuclear-armed military, which is trained for conventional warfare against Indian forces on the plains of Punjab, has been forced to adapt to in strange ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At Nawazkot, a village just north of Makeen, Lt. Col. Yusuf Mehmood said one of his officers, trained in mountain climbing, scaled a 7,000-foot peak with ropes and crampons. The officer had 15 soldiers with him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They managed to get above a group of about 300 militants, and then fired on them,'' the colonel said. The militants scattered, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a hill above Makeen, Colonel Mughal's men hacked a trail with one bulldozer and six donkeys, used to carry weapons and ammunition. The trail was needed as the path for a new forward base overlooking Makeen, a series of small villages of flat-roofed mud compounds stretched out along a narrow valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each night, squads of soldiers, charged with fending off efforts by the militants to steal the lone bulldozer, guarded the precious machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trail took 45 days to build. ''We are fighting within our means,'' one major said wryly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then the trail needed upkeep. Two army engineers, protected with their screen of 15 soldiers, scan the trail every morning for improvised explosive devices planted at night by the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that the snow has melted and pink flowers are blooming, lending a surprising softness to the harsh landscape of dry riverbeds and gravel tracks, the army says it will ask civilians who were ordered to leave last fall to return to their villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The return of the people, many of them marooned in camps in North-West Frontier Province, will probably prove the hardest part of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, many militants are expected to drift back among the civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, the military will remain in South Waziristan for perhaps the next 18 months or so, the army says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But neither the army nor the national civilian government has done much preparation for fixing the broken system of indirect rule in the tribal areas that has failed over the last 60 years to deliver development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of the rebellion of the Pakistani Taliban was fueled by anger at the corruption of tribal leaders who pocketed government money intended for economic development, said a retired army officer, Murad Khan Mehsud, from the village of Nano, not far from Makeen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I told General Kayani that half the teachers in my village are sitting in Dubai or Karachi, not in the schools,'' Mr. Mehsud said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was because under a time-honored practice in the tribal areas, teachers' salaries were not paid to teachers, but to tribal leaders who in turn split the money between their relatives and a government bureaucrat, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some residents have expressed hesitation about returning while the military remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are being asked to go back, but we will only go back when the military leaves,'' said Nasir Muhammad Mehsud, 18, an engineering student from the village of Khaisore, now living in Dera Ismail Khan, a city filled with the displaced from South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the military stays in South Waziristan, Mr. Mehsud said, Pakistani civilians will again be subject to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Taliban, who are not yet defeated. The soldiers, he said, will become targets of the militants, and the people will be caught in between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But most galling, Mr. Mehsud said, was the destruction of family property during the fighting, including 200 houses in his area. So far, there had been no offers of compensation for all that was lost, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brig. Sarfraz Sattar, who leads the army operation in Makeen, acknowledged some of the difficulties of reform. But, he said, he remained upbeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Mehsuds as a tribe did not support the Pakistani Taliban,'' Brigadier Sattar said. ''Baitullah Mehsud terrorized the people, slit the throats of the tribal leaders, and the people had to submit.'' The army inflicted enough damage on the militants, he said, to make it hard for them to regain that kind of control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The arrest in Yemen of a New Jersey man accused of joining Al Qaeda is the latest in an alarming string of cases involving radicalized American Muslims, a trend some experts link to the duration of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yemeni authorities said this week that the American, Sharif Mobley, 26, who had worked for six years as a laborer at nuclear plants in New Jersey, had been arrested last week in Sana, the Yemeni capital, in a sweep of militants tied to the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda and the Somali movement Al Shabab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken to a hospital for medical treatment, Mr. Mobley was said to have grabbed a security guard's gun and shot two guards, one of them fatally, before being subdued, Yemeni officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday that it was investigating Mr. Mobley's record, though a commission spokeswoman, Diane Screnci, said the agency ''is not aware of any security-related concerns or incidents related to Mr. Mobley's prior employment.'' A spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, which operates two nuclear power plants in southern New Jersey, said Mr. Mobley had passed background checks and did routine labor and maintenance at those plants and others in Pennsylvania and Maryland from 2002 to 2008.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Yemeni officials said Mr. Mobley, like the Nigerian man accused of trying to bomb a jetliner headed to Detroit on Dec. 25, had been in contact with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American cleric whose radical sermons have been found on the computers of more than a dozen terrorism suspects in the West. Mr. Awlaki, now in hiding in Yemen, had also exchanged e-mail messages with Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in Texas in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  News of Mr. Mobley's arrest followed the disclosure of charges this week against a 46-year-old American Muslim convert from the Philadelphia suburbs who called herself ''Jihad Jane'' and is accused of plotting to kill a Swedish cartoonist who had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad. The police in Ireland arrested seven people on Tuesday who are suspected of having been involved in the plot against the cartoonist; one of the suspects is also an American, a law enforcement official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mother of a Colorado woman told The Associated Press on Friday that her daughter, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, was among those arrested in Ireland. Her arrest was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Irish Times reported on its Web site on Saturday that three of those arrested had been released. It was not clear whether Ms. Paulin-Ramirez was among them. Ms. Paulin-Ramirez's family could not be located for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cases this week are the latest in a series of terrorism accusations against Americans over the past year that have challenged the conventional wisdom that American Muslims are less susceptible to extremism than those in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a troubling trend, fed by an ideological claim found all over the Web that says the U.S. is at war with Islam,'' said Rick Nelson, director of the counterterrorism program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and co-author of a new study of the homegrown extremist threat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's the message we have to puncture,'' Mr. Nelson said. While such concerns ''can't drive our foreign policy,'' the radicalizing effect of large-scale military intervention overseas must be weighed by policy makers, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The study said the perception that the United States is singling out Muslims, fueled by years of military action in Afghanistan, Iraq, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yemen and other Muslim countries, plays a greater role than ''poverty or social marginalization'' in turning a small number of Americans toward extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama took office last year determined to combat the notion that the United States was hostile to Islam. He pledged to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center and to withdraw troops from Iraq, and he gave a speech in Cairo aimed at addressing Muslim concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he also ordered 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and stepped up missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft on suspected militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Al Qaeda propaganda has hammered on such actions, arguing that Mr. Obama is no different from his predecessor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report on homegrown terrorism found that the other common factor in recent cases of radicalization was the role of ''transnational terrorist recruiters'' like Mr. Awlaki, who lived in the United States from 1990 to 2002. Mr. Awlaki gained a large following among English-speaking Muslims with lectures on compact discs and MP3s, along with a Facebook page and a Web site, which was taken down after he posted a message in November praising the Fort Hood killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About 10 plots or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Muslim militants in the United States last year resulted in 14 deaths, a minuscule fraction of the nation's approximately 14,000 homicides. But counterterrorism officials consider radicalized Americans a particularly dangerous threat, because they can operate freely here with a native's understanding of language, culture and security vulnerabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suspects in the recent rash of cases have diverse backgrounds. ''Jihad Jane,'' the Web name adopted by Colleen R. LaRose, is a middle-aged convert to Islam. Najibullah Zazi, a former coffee vendor who pleaded guilty to plotting to blow up the New York City subway, is a legal immigrant from Afghanistan. Major Hasan, the former Army psychiatrist, is the American son of Palestinian immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mobley, also born in the United States, is from a Muslim family of Somali immigrants. His parents, Charles and Cynthia, told WMGM television in South Jersey that Sharif was a ''good Muslim'' and not a terrorist, and that they were trying to get more information on what happened to him in Yemen. They said F.B.I. agents had visited them. Special Agent Richard J. Wolf, a spokesman for the bureau's Baltimore office, which is handling the matter, said he could not comment on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imam Anas Muhaimin of Masjid Quba, a mosque in Philadelphia, said in an interview that he first knew Sharif Mobley when he attended classes on Arabic and Islam at the mosque as a child. Mr. Mobley occasionally prayed at the mosque in recent years, and in 2007, consulted with Imam Muhaimin about his plan to go to Yemen to study Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I strongly discouraged him from going to Yemen,'' Imam Muhaimin said. ''I told him Yemen was very, very unstable.'' He said that he had suggested language programs in Egypt and Morocco instead, but that Mr. Mobley ''completely rejected my advice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He said he'd made his plans and was determined to go to Yemen,'' Imam Muhaimin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American Muslims, he said, reject the teaching of American Islamic scholars and look abroad to those who preach extremism. ''There's a feeling that authentic Islam is only found overseas, and I think that may be what happened in this case,'' he said.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- Under the cover of a benign government information-gathering program, a Defense Department official set up a network of private contractors in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help track and kill suspected militants, according to military officials and businessmen in Afghanistan and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official, Michael D. Furlong, hired contractors from private security companies that employed former C.I.A. and Special Forces operatives. The contractors, in turn, gathered intelligence on the whereabouts of suspected militants and the location of insurgent camps, and the information was then sent to military units and intelligence officials for possible lethal action in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While it has been widely reported that the C.I.A. and the military are attacking operatives of Al Qaeda and others through unmanned, remote-controlled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> some American officials say they became troubled that Mr. Furlong seemed to be running an off-the-books spy operation. The officials say they are not sure who condoned and supervised his work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is generally considered illegal for the military to hire contractors to act as covert spies. Officials said Mr. Furlong's secret network might have been improperly financed by diverting money from a program designed to merely gather information about the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where Qaeda and Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding, the secret use of private contractors may be seen as an attempt to get around the Pakistani government's prohibition of American military personnel's operating in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials say Mr. Furlong's operation seems to have been shut down, and he is now is the subject of a criminal investigation by the Defense Department for a number of possible offenses, including contract fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even in a region of the world known for intrigue, Mr. Furlong's story stands out. At times, his operation featured a mysterious American company run by retired Special Operations officers and an iconic C.I.A. figure who had a role in some of the agency's most famous episodes, including the Iran-Contra affair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The allegations that he ran this network come as the American intelligence community confronts other instances in which private contractors may have been improperly used on delicate and questionable operations, including secret raids in Iraq and an assassinations program that was halted before it got off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While no legitimate intelligence operations got screwed up, it's generally a bad idea to have freelancers running around a war zone pretending to be James Bond,'' one American government official said. But it is still murky whether Mr. Furlong had approval from top commanders or whether he might have been running a rogue operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This account of his activities is based on interviews with American military and intelligence officials and businessmen in the region. They insisted on anonymity in discussing a delicate case that is under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Col. Kathleen Cook, a spokeswoman for United States Strategic Command, which oversees Mr. Furlong's work, declined to make him available for an interview. Military officials said Mr. Furlong, a retired Air Force officer, is now a senior civilian employee in the military, a full-time Defense Department employee based at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Network of Informants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Furlong has extensive experience in ''psychological operations'' -- the military term for the use of information in warfare -- and he plied his trade in a number of places, including Iraq and the Balkans. It is unclear exactly when Mr. Furlong's operations began. But officials said they seemed to accelerate in the summer of 2009, and by the time they ended, he and his colleagues had established a network of informants in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose job it was to help locate people believed to be insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Government officials said they believed that Mr. Furlong might have channeled money away from a program intended to provide American commanders with information about Afghanistan's social and tribal landscape, and toward secret efforts to hunt militants on both sides of the country's porous border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some officials said it was unclear whether these operations actually resulted in the deaths of militants, though others involved in the operation said that they did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials said that Mr. Furlong would often boast about his network of informants in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to senior military officers, and in one instance said a group of suspected militants carrying rockets by mule over the border had been singled out and killed as a result of his efforts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, at least one government contractor who worked with Mr. Furlong in Afghanistan last year maintains that he saw evidence that the information was used for attacking militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contractor, Robert Young Pelton, an author who writes extensively about war zones, said that the government hired him to gather information about Afghanistan and that Mr. Furlong improperly used his work. ''We were providing information so they could better understand the situation in Afghanistan, and it was being used to kill people,'' Mr. Pelton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that he and Eason Jordan, a former television news executive, had been hired by the military to run a public Web site to help the government gain a better understanding of a region that bedeviled them. Recently, the top military intelligence official in Afghanistan publicly said that intelligence collection was skewed too heavily toward hunting terrorists, at the expense of gaining a deeper understanding of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, Mr. Pelton said, millions of dollars that were supposed to go to the Web site were redirected by Mr. Furlong toward intelligence gathering for the purpose of attacking militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one example, Mr. Pelton said he had been told by Afghan colleagues that video images that he posted on the Web site  had been used for an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the South Waziristan region of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the contractors Mr. Furlong appears to have used to conduct intelligence gathering was International Media Ventures, a private ''strategic communication'' firm run by several former Special Operations officers. Another was American International Security Corporation, a Boston-based company run by Mike Taylor, a former Green Beret. In a phone interview, Mr. Taylor  said that at one point he had employed Duane Clarridge, known as Dewey, a former top C.I.A. official who has been linked to a generation of C.I.A. adventures, including the Iran-Contra scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, Mr. Clarridge denied that he had worked with Mr. Furlong in any operation in Afghanistan or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''I don't know anything about that,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Taylor, who is chief executive of A.I.S.C., said his company gathered information on both sides of the border to give military officials information about possible threats to American forces. He said his company was not specifically hired to provide information to kill insurgents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American officials contend that Mr. Furlong's efforts amounted to little. Nevertheless, they provoked the ire of the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last fall, the spy agency's station chief in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, wrote a memorandum to the Defense Department's top intelligence official detailing what officials said were serious offenses by Mr. Furlong. The officials would not specify the offenses, but the officer's cable helped set off the Pentagon investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan Intelligence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-2008, the military put Mr. Furlong in charge of a program to use private companies to gather information about the political and tribal culture of Afghanistan. Some of the approximately $22 million in government money allotted to this effort went to International Media Ventures, with offices in St. Petersburg, Fla., San Antonio and elsewhere. On its Web site, the company describes itself as a public relations company, ''an industry leader in creating potent messaging content and interactive communications.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Web site also shows that several of its senior executives are former members of the military's Special Operations forces, including former commandos from Delta Force, which has been used extensively since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to track and kill suspected terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until recently, one of the members of International Media's board of directors was Gen. Dell L. Dailey, former head of Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the military's covert units. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an e-mail message, General Dailey said that he had resigned his post on the company's board, but he did not say when. He did not give details about the company's work with the American military, and other company executives declined to comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, the top military spokesman in Afghanistan, said that the United States military was currently employing nine International Media Ventures civilian employees on routine jobs in guard work and information processing and analysis. Whatever else other International Media employees might be doing in Afghanistan, he said, he did not know and had no responsibility for their actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By Mr. Pelton's account, Mr. Furlong, in conversations with him and his colleagues, referred to his stable of contractors as ''my Jason Bournes,'' a reference to the fictional American assassin created by the novelist Robert Ludlum and played in movies by Matt Damon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials said that Mr. Furlong would occasionally brag to his superiors about having Mr. Clarridge's services at his disposal. Last summer, Mr. Furlong told colleagues that he was working with Mr. Clarridge to secure the release of Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl, a kidnapped soldier who American officials believe is being held by militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From December 2008 to mid-June 2009, both Mr. Taylor and Mr. Clarridge were hired to assist The New York Times  in the case of David Rohde, the Times reporter who was kidnapped by militants in Afghanistan and held for seven months in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. The reporter ultimately escaped on his own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The idea for the government information program was thought up sometime in 2008 by Mr. Jordan, a former CNN news chief, and his partner Mr. Pelton, whose books include ''The World's Most Dangerous Places'' and ''Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top General Approached</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They approached Gen. David D. McKiernan, soon to become the top American commander in Afghanistan. Their proposal was to set up a reporting and research network in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the American military and private clients who were trying to understand a complex region that had become vital to Western interests. They already had a similar operation in Iraq -- called ''Iraq Slogger,'' which employed local Iraqis to report and write news stories for their Web site. Mr. Jordan proposed setting up a similar Web site in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- except that the operation would be largely financed by the American military. The name of the Web site was Afpax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Jordan said that he had gone to the United States military because the business in Iraq was not profitable relying solely on private clients. He described his proposal as essentially a news gathering operation, involving only unclassified materials gathered openly by his employees. ''It was all open-source,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Jordan made the pitch to General McKiernan, Mr. Furlong was also present, according to Mr. Jordan. General McKiernan endorsed the proposal, and Mr. Furlong said that he could find financing for Afpax, both Mr. Jordan and Mr. Pelton said. ''On that day, they told us to get to work,'' Mr. Pelton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Jordan said that the help from Mr. Furlong ended up being extremely limited. He said he was paid twice -- once to help the company with start-up costs and another time for a report his group had written. Mr. Jordan declined to talk about exact figures, but said the amount of money was a ''small fraction'' of what he had proposed -- and what it took to run his news gathering operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whenever he asked for financing, Mr. Jordan said, Mr. Furlong told him that the money was being used for other things, and that the appetite for Mr. Jordan's services was diminishing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He told us that there was less and less money for what we were doing, and less of an appreciation for what we were doing,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Admiral Smith, the military's director for strategic communications in Afghanistan, said that when he arrived in Kabul a year later, in June 2009, he opposed financing Afpax. He said that he did not need what Mr. Pelton and Mr. Jordan were offering and that the service seemed uncomfortably close to crossing into intelligence gathering -- which could have meant making targets of individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I took the air out of the balloon,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Admiral Smith said that the C.I.A. was against the proposal for the same reasons. Mr. Furlong persisted in pushing the project, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I finally had to tell him, 'Read my lips,' we're not interested,' '' Admiral Smith said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What happened next is unclear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Admiral Smith said that when he turned down the Afpax proposal, Mr. Furlong wanted to spend the leftover money elsewhere. That is when Mr. Furlong agreed to provide some of International Media Ventures' employees to Admiral Smith's strategic communications office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that still left roughly $15 million unaccounted for, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have no idea where the rest of the money is going,'' Admiral Smith said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week killed a senior commander of Al Qaeda who had played a significant role in planning the killing of Central Intelligence Agency operatives in late December at a base in Afghanistan, according to American officials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The March 8 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was one of a series aimed at suspected participants in the deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Khost Province, which took place just before a meeting with a militant who the Americans believed could provide information on Al Qaeda's operations. Seven Americans and a Jordanian intelligence officer died in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a United States counterterrorism official, the Qaeda operative killed last week was Hussein al-Yemeni. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile struck in Miram Shah in North Waziristan, a part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where Al Qaeda is considered well dug in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described Mr. Yemeni as an ''Al Qaeda planner and facilitator'' in his late 20s or early 30s, who had established ties with the Haqqani network, which has planned many Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan, and with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. His role was described by one American official as a ''conduit in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for funds, messages and recruits, but his real specialty was bombs and suicide operations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear exactly what role Mr. Yemeni might have played in preparing the Jordanian double-agent, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, also known as Humam Khalil Mohammed, for his meeting in Khost on Dec. 30. Mr. Balawi was not searched when entering the compound, and detonated his suicide vest just before he was to be patted down ahead of his meeting with a number of C.I.A. officials. In an unusual statement, a senior intelligence official told reporters the deaths would be ''avenged through successful, aggressive counterterrorism operations.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are part of a covert program that American officials officially refuse to talk about, but whose existence is an open secret. Last year there were roughly 55 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, based on news reporting about the damage they caused. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are a key element of an effort to put pressure on Al Qaeda and its leadership, but in recent weeks they appear to have been used to kill those believed responsible for the Khost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a speech last week in Oklahoma, the C.I.A. director, Leon Panetta, said he believed that the pressure on Al Qaeda had grown so much in recent months that the leadership of its traditional hierarchy, including Osama bin Laden, had been greatly diminished. He said recent communications intercepts had overheard younger militants complaining about the absence of leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of the Bush administration, intelligence officials made similar claims. At the same time, some officials concede, an operation as complex as that in Khost demonstrates that Al Qaeda and the Taliban can still carry out sophisticated terror actions. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT are Americans to make of all the good news coming out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, the Afghan Taliban's military chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was arrested in a raid in February. Around the same time, several of the Taliban's ''shadow governors'' who operate out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were captured by Pakistani forces. Last week, the C.I.A. director, Leon Panetta, announced that thanks in large part to increased cooperation from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border are ''seriously disrupting Al Qaeda,'' and one killed the terrorist suspected of planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an American base in December  that caused the deaths of seven Americans. Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has mounted major operations against its own extremists in places ranging from the Swat Valley in the north of the country to Bajaur on the Afghan border to South Waziristan further south. Yes, extremists continue to do great damage, as at Lahore on March 14  when about 40 civilians were killed in bombings. But after traveling across the country in recent days as a guest of the Pakistani military, I was convinced that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become much more committed to battling extremists over the last couple of years, as the country felt its own security directly threatened. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Things are complicated, as always in this fractious land. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resolve is clearest against its own internal enemies. And while its will to pursue the Afghan Taliban has grown, its policies are changing incrementally, not fundamentally. It is rebuilding trust with America  only slowly. And its obsession with India will continue to constrain its ability and willingness to act against the groups that threaten the NATO mission across the Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, though, give credit where credit is due. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become deadly serious about its own insurgency, loosely referred to as the Tehrik-i-Taliban. Total Pakistani troops in the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan and the tribal areas now number about 150,000, up from 50,000 in 2001. In addition, there are 90,000 paramilitary troops of the Frontier Corps in the area, and they are far better equipped, paid and led than in years past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As I toured the nerve center of the Pakistani military in Rawalpindi, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the army's spokesman, recited an impressive list of statistics. The army now has 821 posts on the Afghan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, as opposed to just 112 manned by NATO and Afghan forces on the other side. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out 209 operations in 2009 of brigade size or larger (that is, involving at least 3,000 troops), twice as many as in the previous two years combined. Convoys bringing supplies for the NATO mission in Afghanistan used to be preyed on frequently by terrorists and thieves; but as a result of the improved security, NATO is now losing only about 0.1 percent of the goods it ships across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carrying out all these operations has been very costly, though. The Pakistani military says it had some 800 soldiers killed in operations last year, in contrast with NATO's total losses in Afghanistan of 520. Thousands of Pakistanis have lost their lives in terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and several hundred village elders, critical figures in any efforts to pacify the tribal areas, have been killed as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most Pakistanis feel, with some justification, they have suffered all this as the result of American decisions and interests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't experience suicide bombings until the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. Pakistanis do not begrudge us that act of self-defense, but do expect us to appreciate the sacrifices they have made. And, while Pakistanis acknowledge American economic help, they consider the $17 billion or so that we have provided since 9/11 to equal only about half their total costs, direct and indirect, from the war on terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hitting the terrorists hard. As a top commander of the Frontier Corps told me from his centuries-old fort here in Peshawar, since 2007 or 2008 he has known that there has been ''no turning back.'' This means ensuring that militants -- or ''miscreants,'' as Pakistanis like to say -- do not return to those areas that have been cleared in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This won't be easy. Often, Pakistani military tactics amount to notifying the local population of a pending mission and asking people to leave before the assault. Afterward, the population is allowed to return -- but any extremists who had snuck out with the people can then try to sneak back in with them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also doesn't want to fight over too much of its territory at any one time. The other day I visited a camp for the displaced near here, with about 100,000 residents. Most fled from recent military operations in Bajaur and Khyber,  near the Afghanistan border. Fortunately, the camp's previous residents, from  Swat, were able to go home before the new influx. Conditions at the camp are tough but tolerable, partly because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not launched additional operations recently. Islamabad's deliberateness makes Washington impatient at times, but there is a strategic logic to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the near term, any progress will be fitful. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems unwilling to move much more of its army away from the Indian border, meaning a further  delay before operations commence in North Waziristan -- home to the Haqqani network, a radical group headed by the Taliban commander Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani, which is believed to be behind some of the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I did not meet any Pakistanis who actually seemed to wish to see the Afghan Taliban back in power. But the country simply does not have the military capacity to make major moves against the Afghan fundamentalists. And, less understandably, Pakistanis tend to see Indian conspiracies behind what is happening in Afghanistan, and fear being trapped between their longtime nemesis on one side and an Indian puppet on the other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the headquarters of the Pakistani spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, I was told that India was suspected of providing explosives to Tehrik-i-Taliban extremists through Afghanistan. Many Pakistanis claim that the Afghan government of Hamid Karzai is essentially a reincarnation of the old Northern Alliance from the Afghan civil war -- a union largely made up of ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks and partly financed by India. (This despite the fact that Afghanistan's ministers of defense and interior are Pashtun, as is President Karzai.)Pakistanis wonder why India is building so many consulates in Afghanistan, and even Indian-subsidized health clinics are considered suspicious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he departed for a ''strategic dialogue'' this week in Washington, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, announced that ''it's time for the United States to do more.'' This isn't what America wants to hear from an oft-unreliable ally. But we must bear in mind that the Pakistani government rules one of the most anti-American populations in the world, and even its elites see us as oft-unreliable ourselves. Washington must stay realistic, and patient, about what can be expected of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- An American charged with helping plan the 2008 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India, moved effortlessly between the United States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India for nearly seven years, training at a militant camp in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on five occasions, according to a plea agreement released by the Justice Department last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The odyssey of David C. Headley, 49, included scouting targets in several cities in India and meeting with a senior operative of Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. These and other new details of Mr. Headley's activities, contained in the plea agreement, raise troubling questions about how an American citizen could travel for so long undetected from his home base in Chicago to well-established terrorist training camps in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The document shows that Mr. Headley made two trips to North Waziristan, the heart of Qaeda operations in the tribal area where the United States is still pushing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a military offensive to clear out militants. His handlers, the document reveals, included a former Pakistani military commander with ties to a Pakistani extremist group and even Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From there, Mr. Headley not only helped plan the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it says, but he was put in contact with a Qaeda cell in Europe that may still be operative. The document shows the cell was well supplied with weapons and money and primed for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until the moment Mr. Headley was arrested by the F.B.I. at O'Hare airport last October. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley divulged details of his life as a spy and militant as part of a plea agreement that will spare him the death penalty, his lawyer, John T. Theis, said this week. Mr. Headley's maximum sentence would be life imprisonment, he said. As part of his plea, Mr. Headley has volunteered to talk to the authorities in India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Denmark, where he was plotting with a Qaeda cell to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Copenhagen offices of the newspaper that had printed derisive cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, the agreement says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The revelations around the European cell were particularly disturbing, said Bruce Riedel, who was a member of the National Security Council in the Clinton administration and is now at the Brookings Institution. They showed that ''Al Qaeda still has a significant operational infrastructure somewhere in Europe,'' he said. Mr. Headley's story also showed in clear contours the close relationship between Al Qaeda and the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley was able to use his Pakistani and American heritage to great advantage, playing up his American descent on his mother's side in India, and then behaving as a Pakistani in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where his father was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he became more intensely involved in the web of militant activities in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- sometimes training for months at a time -- and then making five trips to Mumbai from 2006 to 2008 to scout locations, Mr. Headley kept his base in Chicago, the document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley started his career as a militant scout with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist group established decades ago with the help of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies to fight against India's control of disputed territory in Kashmir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lashkar was supposed to have been outlawed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2002, but it remains active behind the veil of a public charity in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, according to Mr. Headley's plea, continued to be assisted by former Pakistani military officials in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From 2002 to 2005, Mr. Headley trained at Lashkar camps on five occasions, learning about explosives, small arms and countersurveillance techniques. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plea names a retired Pakistani military officer, Col. Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, known as Pasha, as Mr. Headley's main contact with Lashkar. Earlier prosecution documents said that Colonel Syed was arrested last year in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on unspecified charges, but then released. In early 2009 Colonel Syed introduced Mr. Headley to Muhammad Ilyas Kashmiri, a Qaeda operative in North Waziristan, according to the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colonel Syed then served as the go-between for the men, who all met together in North Waziristan, according to the document. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The visit in February 2009 may finally have put Mr. Headley on the radar of the American authorities, who started tracking him in the late spring of last year, Mr. Riedel said. Mr. Kashmiri is considered to be one of Al Qaeda's most dangerous commanders. The Long War Journal, a Web site that specializes in reports on militancy, says he is a former member of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elite commando Special Services Group, though Pakistani intelligence officials deny that. He was the target of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last September. After initial reports that he was killed, it appears that he survived, according to Pakistani officials and militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was Mr. Kashmiri who asked Mr. Headley to help plan the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Danish newspaper, the plea document says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Headley's second trip to North Waziristan in May of last year, he was told by Mr. Kashmiri that the ''elders'' had approved the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Denmark, a remark that Mr. Headley understood to mean the Qaeda leadership, the agreement says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the newspaper, which involved a Qaeda cell already in place in Europe, was planned to be particularly gruesome, with suicide attackers trying to kill everyone in the building, the plea says.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the planning for the Copenhagen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unfolded, Mr. Headley returned to Denmark for a final scouting mission last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He then met with the Qaeda team in Europe, according to the agreement. The precise location of that meeting with Qaeda operatives is not specified in the document, apparently in deference to investigations by Western intelligence agencies. When Mr. Headley was arrested on Oct. 3, 2009, he was headed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once again to meet Mr. Kashmiri in North Waziristan to hand over 13 surveillance videos he had taken in Copenhagen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley's plea agreement with the government was not his first. After being sentenced for drug trafficking in the 1990s, he served as an informant in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the Drug Enforcement Agency as part of a deal for a lighter sentence. He was in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the drug agency from the late 1990s until at least 2001. By 2002, he was training with Lashkar, raising the possibility that he had made contact with the militants while still working for the drug agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to sites in Mumbai, Mr. Headley scouted targets in Pune and Goa, the document says. He was sent to Mumbai several times, it says. There, he made videos of the targets, including the Taj Mahal Hotel, took coordinates with a GPS unit, and scouted sites in the harbor where 10 Lashkar militants landed Nov. 26, 2008, in inflatable boats. They killed 163 people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- American forces have begun operations to push back Taliban insurgents in this most important southern province, the birthplace and spiritual home of the Taliban, and a full-scale offensive is expected in coming weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Taliban have already turned this city into a battlefield as they prepare for the operation, which American officials hope will be decisive in breaking the insurgency's grip on southern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When American forces all arrive, they will encounter challenges larger than any other in Afghanistan. Taliban suicide bombings and assassinations have left this city virtually paralyzed by fear. The insurgents boldly walk the streets, visit shops and even press people into keeping guns and other supplies in their houses for them in preparation for urban warfare, residents say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The government, corrupt and ineffective, lacks almost any popular support. Anyone connected to the government lives in fear of assassination. Its few officials sit barricaded behind high blast walls. Services are scant. Security, people say, is at its worst since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are focusing on the city,'' said Hajji Agha Lalai, a provincial councilor and former head of the peace and reconciliation commission in Kandahar, who has extensive contacts with the Taliban. ''The Taliban want to show themselves to the world, to show, 'We are here,' '' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The intensifying Taliban campaign is a measure of the importance the insurgency places on Kandahar, where the bulk of the 30,000 additional American forces arriving this year are being deployed. That is  a sign of its value to the Americans, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The scale of the coming American offensive is expected to dwarf the recent operation in Marja, in neighboring Helmand Province, where 15,000 American, NATO and Afghan forces were deployed to secure an area much smaller than this provincial capital of 500,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American forces have been preparing for Kandahar since last year, building a presence around this city and along the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to try to secure the province. But as a result, in the most important urban center in southern Afghanistan, life has rapidly deteriorated, residents say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 13, suicide bombers killed 35 people, and the Taliban have issued repeated warnings that they are in the city and planning more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We do not feel safe in town, and even for the men it is dangerous to go out,'' said a female human rights worker who asked not to be named for fear of being singled out by the insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the week before the bombings, officials said, the Taliban conducted a series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police and other officials in the city, killing one or two police officers every night for several days and seizing their weapons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A government official, the well-liked head of the province's Information and Culture Department, Abdul Majeed Babai, was gunned down on his way to work on Feb. 24. He had received threats from the Taliban, who wanted him to leave his position, relatives said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban can walk around,  and government officials cannot,'' Hajji Lalai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The man nominally in charge of Kandahar Province, Gov. Tooryalai Wesa, sat alone in his office reading papers on a recent afternoon. The spacious lawns and rooms of his palace, thronged by  tribal elders and petitioners a few years ago, stood empty and silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the city, it is worse. Government services barely exist. Only 5 of 17 districts in the province are accessible for government officials. Four districts are completely under the control of the insurgents, according to Nader Nadery, deputy head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administrators and police chiefs are appointed to the districts, but they have so little backup and so few resources, they can do little. With 40 to 60 police officers in each district, they can barely guard the district center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Health services and education are virtually absent outside the towns, and two-thirds of the province's schools are closed, human rights officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If a single nurse or midwife is working in the districts, you can call me bad names,'' a women's activist, Shahida Hussain, said. ''Even in the city, they don't have enough equipment -- forget the districts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan officials in the district of Spinbaldak on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border said their area was more secure since American soldiers of the Stryker Brigade were deployed there last year to try to close down Taliban infiltration routes, or ''rat lines,'' as soldiers call them. The road to Spinbaldak had grown safer, and a radio tower had been installed that would allow the government to reach Afghans throughout the border region, the governor, Mr. Wesa, said on a recent visit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the Taliban have repeatedly hit Stryker units in another strategic district, Arghandab, just to the north of Kandahar city with roadside bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Malahjat and Panjwai, agricultural districts to the west and southwest of Kandahar city, farmers say they are under constant threat from mines laid by the militants, as well as from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and helicopters combing the skies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Villagers described at least three instances in recent weeks when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed farmers digging ditches or bringing goods home from the market, as well as other cases when Taliban fighters were hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American helicopters swoop in on villagers who are on motorbikes or are working in the fields and hover over them until the men remove clothing and stand with their arms aloft to show they are not militants, said one man who frequently visits his village by motorbike from the city. He asked not to be named for fear of trouble from any side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the dangers, residents say they are despairing about the political crisis gripping the province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Real power rests with just two families who have prospered under the presence of American forces in the past eight years. One of them is the family of President Hamid Karzai, who is represented here by his brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who heads the provincial council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other belongs to Gul Agha Shirzai, the former governor of Kandahar, and his brothers Bacha Shirzai and Razziq Shirzai, who have gotten lucrative security and construction deals with NATO forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Residents and elders accuse the families of persecuting rivals and excluding all other tribes from access to power. Their domination has undercut any popular backing for the government or the foreign forces supporting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The first thing Afghans fear is the coming of more foreign troops, and the second thing they fear is the empowering of the current leadership and administration,'' said Shahabuddin Akhunzada, a tribal elder from Kandahar city. His Eshaqzai tribe has complained of repeated arrests and political exclusion. The West's acceptance of Mr. Karzai's re-election despite widespread fraud was the last straw, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans, the international community, all the military forces have lost the people's trust,'' he added. ''We don't trust what they say anymore.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Senior lawyers in the Obama administration are deeply divided over some of the counterterrorism powers they inherited from former President George W. Bush, according to interviews and a review of legal briefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rift has been most pronounced between top lawyers in the State Department and the Pentagon, though it has also involved conflicts among career Justice Department lawyers and political appointees throughout the national security agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The discussions, which shaped classified court briefs filed this month, have centered on how broadly to define the types of terrorism suspects who may be detained without trials as wartime prisoners. The outcome of the yearlong debate could reverberate through national security policies, ranging from the number of people the United States ultimately detains to decisions about who may be lawfully selected for killing using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Beyond the technical legal issues, this debate is about the fundamental question of whom we are at war with,'' said Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor who specializes in war-power issues. ''The two problems most plaguing Obama in the war on terrorism are trials for terrorists and taking the fight beyond Afghanistan to places like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Yemen. This issue of whom we are at war with defines both of them.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the years after the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Bush claimed virtually unlimited power as commander in chief to detain those he deemed a threat -- a view so boundless that his Justice Department once told a court that it was within the president's lawful discretion to imprison as an enemy combatant even a ''little old lady in Switzerland'' who had unwittingly donated to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But President Obama and his team, which criticized such claims as an overreach, have sought to demonstrate that the executive branch can wage war while also respecting limits imposed on presidential power by what they see as the rule of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March 2009, the Obama legal team adopted a new position about who was detainable in the war on terrorism -- one that showed greater deference to the international laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, than Mr. Bush had. But what has not been known is that while the administration has stuck to that broad principle, it has been arguing over how to apply the body of law, which was developed for conventional armies, to a war against a terrorist organization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An examination of that conflict offers rich insight into how the team of former law professors and campaign lawyers, nearly all veterans of the Clinton administration, is shaping important policies under Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February 2009, just weeks after the inauguration, John D. Bates, a federal judge overseeing several cases involving detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, asked a provocative question: Did the new administration want to modify Mr. Bush's position that the president could wield sweeping powers to imprison people without trial as wartime detainees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Career Justice Department lawyers handling Guantanamo lawsuits feared that rolling back the Bush position might make it harder to win. And the new acting head of the department's Office of Legal Counsel -- David Barron, a Harvard law professor and co-author of a lengthy law review critique of Bush administration claims that the commander in chief can override statutes -- worried that Judge Bates had given them too little time to devise the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the White House counsel, Greg Craig, a campaign adviser to Mr. Obama who had been a foreign policy official in the Clinton administration, saw this as an important opportunity to demonstrate a break with Mr. Bush. And at a White House meeting, Mr. Obama weighed in, declaring that he did not want to invoke unrestrained commander-in-chief powers in detention matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the president's directions in hand, Mr. Obama's Justice Department came back on March 13, 2009, with a more modest position than Mr. Bush had advanced. It told Judge Bates that the president could detain without trial only people who were part of Al Qaeda or its affiliates, or their ''substantial'' supporters. The department rooted that power in the authorization granted by Congress to use military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it acknowledged that the scope and limits of that power were defined by the laws of war, as translated to a conflict against terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But behind closed doors, the debate flared again that summer, when the Obama administration confronted the case of Belkacem Bensayah, an Algerian man who had been arrested in Bosnia -- far from the active combat zone -- and was being held without trial by the United States at Guantanamo. Mr. Bensayah was accused of facilitating the travel of people who wanted to go to Afghanistan to join Al Qaeda. A judge found that such ''direct support'' was enough to hold him as a wartime prisoner, and the Justice Department asked an appeals court to uphold that ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The arguments over the case forced onto the table discussion of lingering discontent at the State Department over one aspect of the Obama position on detention. There was broad agreement that the law of armed conflict allowed the United States to detain as wartime prisoners anyone who was actually a part of Al Qaeda, as well as nonmembers who took positions alongside the enemy force and helped it. But some criticized the notion that the United States could also consider mere supporters, arrested far away, to be just as detainable without trial as enemy fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That view was amplified after Harold Koh, a former human-rights official and Yale Law School dean who had been a leading critic of the Bush administration's detainee policies, became the State Department's top lawyer in late June. Mr. Koh produced a lengthy, secret memo contending that there was no support in the laws of war for the United States' position in the Bensayah case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Koh found himself in immediate conflict with the Pentagon's top lawyer, Jeh C. Johnson, a former Air Force general counsel and trial lawyer who had been an adviser to Mr. Obama during the presidential campaign. Mr. Johnson produced his own secret memorandum arguing for a more flexible interpretation of who could be detained under the laws of war -- now or in the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September 2009, national-security officials from across the government packed into the Office of Legal Counsel's conference room on the fifth floor of the Justice Department, lining the walls, to watch Mr. Koh and Mr. Johnson debate around a long table. It was up to Mr. Barron, who sat at the head of the table, to decide who was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he did not. Instead, days later, he circulated a preliminary draft memorandum stating that while the Office of Legal Counsel had found no precedents justifying the detention of mere supporters of Al Qaeda who were picked up far away from enemy forces, it was not prepared to state any definitive conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So with no consensus, the legal team decided on a tactical approach. For as long as possible they would try to avoid that hard question. They changed the subject by instead asking courts to agree that people like Mr. Bensayah, looked at from another angle, had performed functions that made them effectively part of the terrorist organization -- and so were clearly detainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The appeals court has not yet ruled on Mr. Bensayah's case. But the hours and effort that high-level officials expended on wrestling over adjustments to the reasoning in his case -- only to reach the same outcome, that he was detainable without trial -- dovetailed with a pattern identified by critics as varied as civil libertarians and former Bush lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the change in tone has been important and has helped internationally,'' said John B. Bellinger III, a top Bush era National Security Council and State Department lawyer. ''But the change in law has been largely cosmetic. And of course there has been no change in outcome.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But at a recent American Bar Association event, Mr. Koh argued that the administration's changes -- including requiring strict adherence to anti-torture rules and ensuring that all detainees are being held pursuant to recognizable legal authorities -- have been meaningful. The United States, he said, can now defend its national-security policies as fully compliant with domestic and international law under ''common and universal standards, not double standards.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not saying that we don't have to fight battles,'' he said. ''We're just saying that we should fight those battles within the framework of law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, in another speech, Mr. Koh also for the first time outlined portions of the administration's legal rationale for targeted killings using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which some scholars have criticized. His remarks, however, focused on issues like whether it was lawful to single out specific enemy figures for killing -- not defining the limits of who may be deemed an enemy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Feldman, the Harvard professor, said the detention debate also had ''serious consequences'' for the targeted killings policy because, ''If we're at war with you, then we can detain you -- but we can also try to kill you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That said, he cautioned, additional factors complicate the analysis of selecting lawful targets. Among them, it is not clear whether Mr. Obama is more willing in classified settings to assert that, as commander in chief, he can use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to defend the country against perceived threats that cannot be linked to the Congressionally authorized war against Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And even in detention matters, Bush-era theories have remained attractive to some. This January, two appeals court judges appointed by Mr. Bush -- Janice Rogers Brown and Brett M. Kavanaugh, both of whom had been singled out by Democrats after their nominations as too ideological -- reopened the debate by unexpectedly declaring, in another Guantanamo case, that the laws of armed conflict did not limit the president's war powers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Justice Department, career litigators who defend against Guantanamo lawsuits wanted to embrace that reasoning, arguing it would help them win. Judges have sided with detainees seeking release in some 34 of 46 cases to date -- though the decisions largely turned on skepticism about specific evidence, not the general legal theory about who was detainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But political appointees -- including Mr. Barron, Mr. Koh and even Mr. Johnson -- criticized the reasoning of the appeals court ruling as vulnerable to reversal and argued that the administration should not abandon its respect for the laws of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In classified briefs filed in several detainee cases this month, officials said, the Justice Department adopted an ambivalent stance. It cited the ruling as a precedent while also reasserting its own contradictory argument that the laws of war matter. The debate would go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We'll see how the cases develop,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in an interview in February, in the midst of that latest round. But, he added, ''I don't think we are going to deviate from our argument.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOINT BASE BALAD, Iraq -- Early this year a ''fob in a box'' -- military slang for 80 shipping containers with all the tents, showers and construction material needed to set up a remote forward operating base -- was put on trucks here for the trip from one war to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Left over and never used in Iraq, the fob rumbled north to Turkey, east through Georgia and Azerbaijan, by ship across the Caspian Sea to Kazakhstan, then south on the old Soviet rail lines of Uzbekistan into northern Afghanistan. There -- the end of a seven-nation, 2,300-mile, two-and-a-half-month odyssey -- it was assembled just weeks ago as home for several hundred of the thousands of American forces entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In trying to speed 30,000 reinforcements into Afghanistan while reducing American forces in Iraq by 50,000, American commanders are orchestrating one of the largest movements of troops and materiel since World War II. Military officials say that transporting so many people and billions of dollars' worth of equipment, weapons, housing, fuel and food in and out of both countries between now and an August deadline is as critical and difficult as what is occurring on the battlefield.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials, who called the start of the five-month logistics operation ''March Madness,'' say it is like trying to squeeze a basketball through a narrow pipe, particularly the supply route through the Khyber Pass linking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So many convoys loaded with American supplies came under insurgent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year that the United States military now tags each truck with a GPS device and keeps 24-hour watch by video feed at a military base in the United States. Last year the Taliban blew up a bridge near the pass, temporarily suspending the convoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Hannibal trying to move over the Alps had a tremendous logistics burden, but it was nothing like the complexity we are dealing with now,'' said Lt. Gen. William G. Webster, the commander of the United States Third Army, using one of the extravagant historical parallels that commanders have deployed for the occasion. He spoke at a military base in the Kuwaiti desert before a vast sandscape upon which were armored trucks that had been driven out of Iraq and were waiting to be junked, sent home or taken on to Kabul, Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The general is not moving elephants, but the scale and intricacy of the operation are staggering. The military says there are 3.1 million pieces of equipment in Iraq, from tanks to coffee makers, two-thirds of which are to leave the country. Of that, about half will go on to Afghanistan, where there are already severe strains on the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Overcrowding at Bagram Air Base, the military's main flight hub in Afghanistan, is so severe that beds are at a premium and troops are jammed into tents alongside runways. Cargo planes, bombers, jet fighters, helicopters and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are stacked up in the skies, waiting to land. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All lethal supplies -- weapons, armored trucks, eight-wheeled Stryker troop carriers -- come in by air to avoid </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but everything else goes by sea and land. The standard route from Iraq to Afghanistan is south from Baghdad and down through Kuwait, by ship through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz to Karachi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, then overland once again. The ''fob in a box'' went on an experimental and potentially less expensive journey through Turkey to link up with a new northern route through Central Asia, which was opened last year for supplies going to Afghanistan from Europe and the United States as an alternative to the risky trip through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both routes circle Iran, by far the most direct way to get from Baghdad to Kabul, but off limits because of the country's hostile relationship with the United States. ''These are the cards that we're dealt,'' said Gen. Duncan J. McNabb, who oversees all military logistics as the leader of the United States Transportation Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonlethal supplies flowing into Afghanistan include cement, lumber, blast barriers, septic tanks and rubberized matting, all to expand space at airfields and double, to 40, the number of forward operating bases in a country that has an infrastructure closer to the 14th century than the 21st.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. David H. Petraeus of the United States Central Command, in another grand historical parallel, recently called the construction under way ''the largest building boom in Afghanistan since Alexander built Kandahar,'' a reference to the conqueror of Afghanistan in the fourth century B.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Food shipments alone are enough to feed an army. The Defense Logistics Agency, which provides meals for 415,000 troops, contractors and American civilians each day in both wars, shipped 1.1 million frozen hamburger patties to Afghanistan  in March alone, compared with 663,000 burgers in March 2009. The agency also supplied 27 million gallons of fuel to forces in Afghanistan this month, compared with 15 million gallons a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commanders say that their chief worry is that the equipment and supplies will not arrive in sync with the troops. Their biggest enemy, they say, is the short time between now and August, the deadline set in separate plans for each war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early last year, President Obama and military commanders agreed on a withdrawal plan to reduce United States forces in Iraq to 50,000 by Aug. 31 ( 97,000 United States troops are there now), with all American forces out by 2011. Late last year, he pushed commanders to speed up the infusion of new troops into Afghanistan -- military planners had originally said it would take 18 months -- so that 30,000 new troops would get there by August. So far, about 6,000 of those reinforcements have arrived. Once they all get there, there will be close to 100,000 United States troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a great sense of urgency in getting in and getting effective,'' said Vice Adm. Alan S. Thompson, the director of the Defense Logistics Agency. ''The administration is concerned about being able to show results quickly.'' There are obvious strains, he said, but ''I think it's doable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, General McNabb, in yet another reference to Alexander the Great, said that when he took over the transportation command in 2008, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates reminded him of the well-known words attributed to the famous conqueror: ''My logisticians are a humorless lot; they know if my campaign fails they are the first ones I will slay.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gates had his own words of advice. ''He just said, 'Hey, it's a tough job, better figure it out,' '' General McNabb said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A stepped-up campaign of American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past three months has battered Al Qaeda and its Pakistani and Afghan brethren in the tribal area of North Waziristan, according to a mid-ranking militant and supporters of the government there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have cast a pall of fear over an area that was once a free zone for Al Qaeda and the Taliban, forcing militants to abandon satellite phones and large gatherings in favor of communicating by courier and moving stealthily in small groups, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, operated by the C.I.A., fly overhead sometimes four at a time, emitting a beelike hum virtually 24 hours a day, observing and tracking targets, then unleashing missiles on their quarry, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have sharpened tensions between the local tribesmen and the militants, who have dumped bodies with signs accusing the victims of being American spies in Miram Shah, the main town in North Waziristan, they said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The impact of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the militants' operations -- on freedom of movement, ability to communicate and the ease of importing new recruits to replace those who have been killed -- has been difficult to divine because North Waziristan, at the nether reaches of the tribal area, is virtually sealed from the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of those interviewed would allow their names to be used for fear for their safety, and all were interviewed separately in a city outside the tribal areas. The supporters of the government worked in positions where they had access to information about the effects of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along with that of the militant, the accounts provided a rare window on how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have transformed life for all in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By all reports, the bombardment of North Waziristan, and to a lesser extent South Waziristan, has become fast and furious since a combined Taliban and Qaeda suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a C.I.A. base in Khost, in southern Afghanistan, in late December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the first six weeks of this year, more than a dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed up to 90 people suspected of being militants, according to Pakistani and American accounts. There are now multiple </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on some days, and in some weeks the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occur every other day, the people from North Waziristan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have become so ferocious, ''It seems they really want to kill everyone, not just the leaders,'' said the militant, who is a mid-ranking fighter associated with the insurgent network headed by Jalaluddin and Sirajuddin Haqqani. By ''everyone'' he meant rank-and-file fighters, though civilians are being killed, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tactics used just a year ago to avoid the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not be relied on, he said. It is, for instance, no longer feasible to sleep under the trees as a way of avoiding the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''We can't lead a jungle existence for 24 hours every day,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Militants now sneak into villages two at a time to sleep, he said. Some homeowners were refusing to rent space to Arabs, who are associated with Al Qaeda, for fear of their families' being killed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants have abandoned all-terrain vehicles in favor of humdrum public transportation, one of the government supporters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Arabs, who have always preferred to keep at a distance from the locals, have now gone further underground, resorting to hide-outs in tunnels dug into the mountainside in the Datta Khel area adjacent to Miram Shah, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Definitely Haqqani is under a lot of pressure,'' the militant said. ''He has lost commanders, a brother and other family members.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While unpopular among the Pakistani public, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have become a weapon of choice for the Obama administration after the Pakistani Army rebuffed pleas to mount a ground offensive in North Waziristan to take on the militants who use the area to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military says it is already overstretched fighting militants on other fronts. But the militants in North Waziristan -- the Haqqani network backed by Al Qaeda -- are also longtime allies of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence services. The group may yet prove useful for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to exert influence in postwar Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army maintains a division of soldiers in North Waziristan, but, the militant said, the Pakistani soldiers do little to hinder militant operations, which, though under greater pressure from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have by no means stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Training sessions on how to make improvised explosive devices for use against American and NATO soldiers in Afghanistan continue, the militant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one eight-day ''crash course'' in March, the militant said he learned how to mix explosive chemicals and how to load a car with explosives that would be used in suicide bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In public, the Pakistani government opposes the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, citing a violation of sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under American pressure, however, the Pakistani intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, has provided important intelligence for targets, American and Pakistani officials have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But increasingly the Americans appear to have developed their own sources, the militant said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An influx of young Arabs turned up in North Waziristan recently, presumably to replace some of the older Arabs who had been killed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But many militants assumed that some of these Arabs were actually American agents, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al Qaeda is very careful who they take among the new Arab recruits because they are informants for America,'' the militant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps the most disturbing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the Haqqanis was the killing of Sirajuddin Haqqani's younger brother, Mohammad, on Feb. 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One government supporter in the area said he witnessed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''I was walking when I saw two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, one going in one direction, one in another direction. I had a feeling they were preparing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were ''two blasts'' when a car was hit about 1,200 feet in front of him, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There was total dust, everything was hazy,'' he said. Suddenly, Haqqani fighters appeared out of nowhere. ''All these vehicles rushed up, cordoned the site so no outsider could come. They took away the dead bodies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question of civilian deaths is an almost daily worry, all four men said. ''Civilians are worried because there is hardly a house without a fighter,'' the militant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two of the government supporters said they knew of civilians, including friends, who had been killed by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But, they said, they are prepared to sacrifice the civilians if it means North Waziristan will be rid of the militants, in particular the Arabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''On balance, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have killed 100, 200, 500 civilians,'' said one of the men. ''If you look at the other guys, the Arabs and the kidnappings and the targeted killings, I would go for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama took the stage in Cairo last June, promising a new relationship with the Islamic world, Muslims in America wondered only half-jokingly whether the overture included them. After all, Mr. Obama had kept his distance during the campaign, never visiting an American mosque and describing the false claim that he was Muslim as a ''smear'' on his Web site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly a year later, Mr. Obama has yet to set foot in an American mosque. And he still has not met with Muslim and Arab-American leaders. But less publicly, his administration has reached out to this politically isolated constituency in a sustained and widening effort that has left even skeptics surprised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Muslim and Arab-American advocates have participated in policy discussions and received briefings from top White House aides and other officials on health care legislation, foreign policy, the economy, immigration and national security. They have met privately with a senior White House adviser, Valerie Jarrett, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss civil liberties concerns and counterterrorism strategy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The impact of this continuing dialogue is difficult to measure, but White House officials cited several recent government actions that were influenced, in part, by the discussions. The meeting with Ms. Napolitano was among many factors that contributed to the government's decision this month to end a policy subjecting passengers from 14 countries, most of them Muslim, to additional scrutiny at airports, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That emergency directive, enacted after a failed Dec. 25 bombing plot, has been replaced with a new set of intelligence-based protocols that law enforcement officials consider more effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also this month, Tariq Ramadan, a prominent Muslim academic, visited the United States for the first time in six years after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reversed a decision by the Bush administration, which had barred Mr. Ramadan from entering the country, initially citing the U.S.A. Patriot Act. Mrs. Clinton also cleared the way for another well-known Muslim professor, Adam Habib, who had been denied entry under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arab-American and Muslim leaders said they had yet to see substantive changes on a variety of issues, including what they describe as excessive airport screening, policies that have chilled Muslim charitable giving and invasive F.B.I. surveillance guidelines. But they are encouraged by the extent of their consultation by the White House and governmental agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For the first time in eight years, we have the opportunity to meet, engage, discuss, disagree, but have an impact on policy,'' said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in Washington. ''We're being made to feel a part of that process and that there is somebody listening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the post-9/11 era, Muslims and Arab-Americans have posed something of a conundrum for the government: they are seen as a political liability but also, increasingly, as an important partner in countering the threat of homegrown terrorism. Under President George W. Bush, leaders of these groups met with government representatives from time to time, but said they had limited interaction with senior officials. While Mr. Obama has yet to hold the kind of high-profile meeting that Muslims and Arab-Americans seek, there is a consensus among his policymakers that engagement is no longer optional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration's approach has been understated. Many meetings have been private; others were publicized only after the fact. A visit to New York University in February by John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, drew little news coverage, but caused a stir among Muslims around the country. Speaking to Muslim students, activists and others, Mr. Brennan acknowledged many of their grievances, including ''surveillance that has been excessive,'' ''overinclusive no-fly lists'' and ''an unhelpful atmosphere around many Muslim charities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These are challenges we face together as Americans,'' said Mr. Brennan, who momentarily showed off his Arabic to hearty applause. He and other officials have made a point of disassociating Islam from terrorism in public comments, using the phrase ''violent extremism'' in place of words like ''jihad'' and ''Islamic terrorism.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the administration's solicitation of Muslims and Arab-Americans has drawn little fanfare, it has not escaped criticism. A small but vocal group of research analysts, bloggers and others complain that the government is reaching out to Muslim leaders and organizations with an Islamist agenda or ties to extremist groups abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They point out that Ms. Jarrett gave the keynote address at the annual convention for the Islamic Society of North America. The group was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, a Texas-based charity whose leaders were convicted in 2008 of funneling money to Hamas. The society denies any links to terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think dialogue is good, but it has to be with genuine moderates,'' said Steven Emerson, a terrorism analyst who advises government officials. ''These are the wrong groups to legitimize.'' Mr. Emerson and others have also objected to the political appointments of several American Muslims, including Rashad Hussain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February, the president chose Mr. Hussain, a 31-year-old White House lawyer, to become the United States' special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The position, a kind of ambassador at large to Muslim countries, was created by Mr. Bush. In a video address, Mr. Obama highlighted Mr. Hussain's status as a ''close and trusted member of my White House staff'' and ''a hafiz,'' a person who has memorized the Koran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within days of the announcement, news reports surfaced about comments Mr. Hussain had made on a panel in 2004, while he was a student at Yale Law School, in which he referred to several domestic terrorism prosecutions as ''politically motivated.'' Among the cases he criticized was that of Sami Al-Arian, a former computer-science professor in Florida who pleaded guilty to aiding members of a Palestinian terrorist group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first, the White House said Mr. Hussain did not recall making the comments, which had been removed from the Web version of a 2004 article published by a small Washington magazine. When Politico obtained a recording of the panel, Mr. Hussain acknowledged criticizing the prosecutions but said he believed the magazine quoted him inaccurately, prompting him to ask its editor to remove the comments. On Feb. 22, The Washington Examiner ran an editorial with the headline ''Obama Selects a Voice of Radical Islam.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Muslim leaders watched carefully as the story migrated to Fox News. They had grown accustomed to close scrutiny, many said in interviews, but were nonetheless surprised. In 2008, Mr. Hussain had co-authored a paper for the Brookings Institution arguing that the government should use the peaceful teachings of Islam to fight terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Rashad Hussain is about as squeaky clean as you get,'' said Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is Muslim. Mr. Ellison and others wondered whether the administration would buckle under the pressure and were relieved when the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, defended Mr. Hussain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The fact that the president and the administration have appointed Muslims to positions and have stood by them when they've been attacked is the best we can hope for,'' said Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was notably different during Mr. Obama's run for office. In June 2008, volunteers of his campaign barred two Muslim women in headscarves from appearing behind Mr. Obama at a rally in Detroit, eliciting widespread criticism. The campaign promptly recruited Mazen Asbahi, a 36-year-old corporate lawyer and popular Muslim activist from Chicago, to become its liaison to Muslims and Arab-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bloggers began researching Mr. Asbahi's background. For a brief time in 2000, he had sat on the board of an Islamic investment fund, along with Sheikh Jamal Said, a Chicago imam who was later named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land case. Mr. Asbahi said in an interview that he had left the board after three weeks because he wanted no association with the imam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after his appointment to the Obama campaign, Mr. Asbahi said, a Wall Street Journal reporter began asking questions about his connection to the imam. Campaign officials became concerned that news coverage would give critics ammunition to link the imam to Mr. Obama, Mr. Asbahi recalled. On their recommendation, Mr. Asbahi agreed to resign from the campaign, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is still unsettled by the power of his detractors. ''To be in the midst of this campaign of change and hope and to have it stripped away over nothing,'' he said. ''It hurts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the moment Mr. Obama took office, he seemed eager to change the tenor of America's relationship with Muslims worldwide. He gave his first interview to Al Arabiya, the Arabic-language television station based in Dubai. Muslims cautiously welcomed his ban on torture and his pledge to close Guantanamo within a year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his Cairo address, he laid out his vision for ''a new beginning'' with Muslims: while America would continue to fight terrorism, he said, terrorism would no longer define America's approach to Muslims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Back at home, Muslim and Arab-American leaders remained skeptical. But they took note when, a few weeks later, Mohamed Magid, a prominent imam from Sterling, Va., and Rami Nashashibi, a Muslim activist from Chicago, joined the president at a White-House meeting about fatherhood. Also that month, Dr. Faisal Qazi, a board member of American Muslim Health Professionals, began meeting with administration officials to discuss health care reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The invitations were aimed at expanding the government's relationship with Muslims and Arab-Americans to areas beyond security, said Mr. Hussain, the White House's special envoy. Mr. Hussain began advising the president on issues related to Islam after joining the White House counsel's office in January 2009. He helped draft Mr. Obama's Cairo speech and accompanied him on the trip. ''The president realizes that you cannot engage one-fourth of the world's population based on the erroneous beliefs of a fringe few,'' Mr. Hussain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other government offices followed the lead of the White House. In October, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke met with Arab-Americans and Muslims in Dearborn, Mich., to discuss challenges facing small-business owners. Also last fall, Farah Pandith was sworn in as the State Department's first special representative to Muslim communities. While Ms. Pandith works mostly with Muslims abroad, she said she had also consulted with American Muslims because Mrs. Clinton believes ''they can add value overseas.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite this, American actions abroad -- including civilian deaths from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the failure to close Guantanamo -- have drawn the anger of Muslims and Arab-Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even though their involvement with the administration has broadened, they remain most concerned about security-related policies. In January, when the Department of Homeland Security hosted a two-day meeting with Muslim, Arab-American, South Asian and Sikh leaders, the group expressed concern about the emergency directive subjecting passengers from a group of Muslim countries to additional screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, pointed out that the policy would never have caught the attempted shoe bomber Richard Reid, who is British. ''It almost sends the signal that the government is going to treat nationals of powerless countries differently from countries that are powerful,'' Ms. Khera recalled saying as community leaders around the table nodded their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Napolitano, who sat with the group for more than an hour, committed to meeting with them more frequently. Ms. Khera said she left feeling somewhat hopeful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think our message is finally starting to get through,'' she said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failed plot to bomb three New York City subway lines during the morning rush last September was spawned in 2008 by two senior Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who sent three New Yorkers back home to carry out a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> federal officials said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The failed plot to bomb three New York City subway lines during the morning rush last September was hatched in 2008 by two senior Qaeda leaders in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where they met personally with three would-be suicide attackers from Queens to urge them to carry out a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> federal authorities said Friday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last October, in the weeks after one of the three men, Najibullah Zazi, was arrested, the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said that the plot represented one of the most serious threats to the United States since 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A federal prosecutor, speaking in United States District Court in Brooklyn on Friday, disclosed what he said was the role of the two senior Qaeda leaders for the first time and identified them as Saleh al-Somali, the group's head of external operations, and Rashid Rauf, a key operative. Both were reported killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The prosecutor, Jeffrey H. Knox, the assistant United States attorney overseeing the case against the three men from Queens, made the disclosure during a court proceeding in which one of the two other men, Zarein Ahmedzay, 25, an Afghan immigrant, pleaded guilty to the bomb plot and other crimes. Mr. Zazi, who moved to Denver from Queens early last year and worked as an airport shuttle bus driver, had pleaded guilty to the same crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his guilty plea, Mr. Ahmedzay, a short, bearded man, quoted from the Koran before describing his role in the bomb plot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, appearing at ease, he suggested that a Zionist conspiracy represents a greater threat to the United States than Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And I believe that the real enemies of this country are the ones destroying this country from within,'' he said. ''And I believe these are the special group, the Zionist Jews, I believe, who want a permanent shadow government within the government of the United States of America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The judge interrupted him. The three men traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August 2008 and had planned to cross the border into Afghanistan to join the Taliban and kill American soldiers in order to overthrow what he called the ''corrupt and imposter Karzai government'' and ''establish the perfect justice of Allah,'' Mr. Ahmedzay said during his guilty plea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They eventually met a Qaeda figure in Peshawar, then traveled to Waziristan for training. There, they met with Mr. Rauf and Mr. al-Somali, although they did not learn their true identities, the Justice Department said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A news release issued in Washington by the Justice Department about the guilty plea did not say why the disclosure about the Qaeda leaders was made on Friday. Spokesmen for the agency and for the office of the Brooklyn United States attorney, Benton J. Campbell, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ahmedzay told the judge that the meeting with the Qaeda leaders occurred shortly after he and his two friends from Queens arrived at the group's compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We told these two individuals that we wanted to wage jihad in Afghanistan, but they said that we would be more useful to them and to the jihad if we returned to New York and conducted operations there,'' he said, adding in response to a question from the judge that the three young men understood the Qaeda leaders to be referring to suicide bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ahmedzay said he and his friends told the men that they needed time to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We discussed the matter amongst ourselves and we agreed to go forward with the plan,'' he said. ''I personally believed that conducting an operation in the United States would be the best way to end the wars.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the leaders wanted his input because of his familiarity with New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They said the most important thing was to hit well-known structures and to maximize the number of casualties,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he said that he himself had selected the subways as their target, rather than a large structure like a building, because of the amount of explosives that Mr. Zazi, who was the only one of the three to undergo explosives training in Waziristan, believed he could make. All three men, he said, agreed to the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ahmedzay said that at one point later he had doubts about going forward with the bombing, but resolved to carry it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three men were charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction,  and to commit murder in a foreign country,  and giving support to Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zazi has been cooperating with prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ahmedzay's lawyer, Michael Marinaccio, would not discuss whether his client was cooperating with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plea by Mr. Ahmedzay leaves Adis Medunjanin, 25, as the only remaining defendant in the case facing trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE highly classified C.I.A. program to kill militants in the tribal regions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with missiles fired from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the world's worst-kept secret.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has long tried to maintain plausible deniability that it is behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warfare in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a country that pollsters consistently find is one of the most anti-American in the world. For reasons of its own, the Pakistani government has also sought to hide the fact that it secretly agreed to allow the United States to fly some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out of a base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants on its territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are good reasons for the United States, which conducted 53 such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2009 alone, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to finally acknowledge the existence of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, there is the matter of Pakistani civilian casualties caused by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In a poll last summer, only 9 percent of Pakistanis approved of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A key reason for this unpopularity is the widespread perception that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overwhelmingly kill civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A survey we have made of reliable press accounts indicates that since January 2009, the reported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed at least 520 people, of whom around 410 were described as militants, suggesting that the civilian death rate is about 20 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's possible, however, that the number is even lower. An American counterterrorism official told The  Times in December that the civilian fatality rate is only 5 percent, saying that ''just over 20'' civilians and more than 400 militants were killed in 2009. Should the American government's claims about the small number of civilian deaths be verified, some of the Pakistani hostility toward the United States might dissipate. This would be much easier if the now-classified videotapes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were made available to independent researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Acknowledging the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program would also help advance our efforts -- and improve our profile -- in the region by providing an excellent example of the deepening United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategic partnership. Since January 2009, up to 85 reported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed militants who are responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis. A good deal of the intelligence that enables these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes from the Pakistanis themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last, Pakistanis once considered any military offensive against the Taliban as fighting America's war. But because of the cumulative weight of the Taliban's atrocities against politicians, soldiers, police and civilians, Pakistanis now believe that battling the militants is in the country's own interest. As a result, over the past year, the public's support for the Pakistani Army's efforts in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan has surged. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came clean about its involvement with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, public backing for the program might similarly increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, by acknowledging the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Obama administration would also have to admit that civilians are sometimes killed in these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Afghan civilians are killed by American forces, their families are often compensated by the United States. Surely, the families of Pakistani civilians killed in American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deserve the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is by Sabrina Tavernise,Carlotta Gall and Ismail Khan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The Pakistani military, long reluctant to heed American urging that it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pakistani militant groups in their main base in North Waziristan, is coming around to the idea that it must do so, in its  own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western officials have long believed that North Waziristan is the single most important haven for militants with Al Qaeda and the Taliban fighting American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has nurtured militant groups in the area for years in order to exert influence beyond its borders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The developing shift in thinking -- described in recent interviews with Western diplomats and Pakistani security officials -- represents a significant change for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military, which has moved against Taliban militants who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Pakistani state, but largely left those fighting in Afghanistan alone. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That distinction is becoming harder to maintain, Pakistani and Western officials say, as the area becomes an alphabet soup of dangerous militant groups that have joined forces to extend their reach deeper inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a scary phenomenon,'' one Western diplomat said. ''All these groups are beginning to morph together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The consensus is gathering against a background of improved United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations. The Obama administration's efforts with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are beginning to bear fruit, officials said, while the countries' armies have begun working together more closely, particularly since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stepped up its military efforts, according to a Pentagon report to Congress released this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, any operation in North Waziristan by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> badly stretched military would still be months away, Pakistani and Western officials said. And even if it is undertaken, the offensive may not completely sever </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship with the militants, like Sirajuddin Haqqani, who serve its interests in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The area has long been a sanctuary for Mr. Haqqani, a longtime asset of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence services who is also one of the most dangerous figures in the insurgency against American forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, however, it has also become home to Hakimullah Mehsud, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enemy No. 1, who is now believed to have survived an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in January, according to the Western diplomat and Pakistani intelligence officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He and his supporters fled a Pakistani military operation in South Waziristan that began last October. Though </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military said the operation was completed last month, its soldiers are still dying there in rising numbers, as Mr. Mehsud and his forces </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at them from their new base. In recent weeks, at least 19 soldiers have been killed in areas where the military had all but claimed victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To make matters worse, families who left during the operation are reluctant to return to their homes, saying they are afraid of vengeful leaders still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They know a lot of these guys have fled to North Waziristan,'' said a Western diplomat in Islamabad. ''That's patently obvious. And sooner or later,'' the diplomat continued, ''they're going to have to go in there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a separate interview, a senior Pakistani official concurred. ''The source of the problem is in North Waziristan, and it will have to be addressed,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because he was not allowed to speak publicly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The growing consensus on North Waziristan comes after a year in which the Pakistani military has opened several fronts against the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, beginning with a campaign in the Swat Valley last spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighting has cost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about 2,700 soldiers since 2001, nearly triple the total number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in the same period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Militants struck back, hitting the military's headquarters in Rawalpindi, a mosque where military families prayed, and the offices of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence agencies in three cities. The number of Pakistani civilians killed last year in Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exceeded civilian deaths even in Afghanistan, helping shift public opinion against the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think it has become very dramatic that these people are out after them,'' the diplomat said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighting -- coupled with intense American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the western tribal region -- has splintered the militant groups, which are now a poisonous mix of Pashtun tribesmen, Arabs, Uzbeks and ethnic Punjabis, known for their brutality against Shiites and their close links to Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fracturing is so profound that one Pakistani government official in the tribal region said that the Pakistani Taliban now consisted of several parts operating independently, and that the groups ''do not necessarily take orders from Hakimullah Mehsud.'' But the widening military campaign has also given them common cause. Operations by the militants have become more fluid. ''All these groups are helping each other out and selling their services to the highest bidder,'' the diplomat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials recognize that the evolving nature of the militants has made them more dangerous -- and made the necessity of going after them in North Waziristan increasingly unavoidable. ''Their nexus with the Punjabi Taliban have given them greater reach,'' a Pakistani law enforcement official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even as there is a growing consensus that North Waziristan is now the source of the problem, there is a continuing debate in the military over when and how to tackle it. Publicly the Pakistani military is saying that it is already fighting on several fronts, and that it does not have the resources to push into North Waziristan for at least several months. Western officials say they believe that the Pakistani military is doing as much as it can under the circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is also an understanding that opening a new front in North Waziristan -- with its tangle of tribes, Qaeda militants, antistate groups and Haqqani supporters, thought to be in the thousands -- will be a formidable task. ''To go after Haqqani, it takes a very sizable military operation,'' the diplomat said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some officials say an operation could come sooner, not least because officers on the ground are calling for it. More frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emanating from North Waziristan ''are likely to lead to a reaction sooner rather than later as field commanders feel the pressure to protect their troops,'' said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia program at the Atlantic Council in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others argue that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should wait and see how the American-led military offensive in southern Afghanistan plays out this summer. One senior military officer who favors Pakistani military action sooner derisively called that option ''sitzkrieg,'' Mr. Nawaz said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whatever the case, the military would most likely avoid a frontal invasion, some officials suggested, and instead bolster the forces it already maintains in the area, about 10,000 soldiers.  Pakistani forces in North Waziristan, which include the paramilitary Frontier Corps, are mostly confined to their barracks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the prospect of a shift on North Waziristan, there is no apparent change in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attitude toward the leadership council of the Afghan Taliban, which manages the insurgency from in and around the city of Quetta, in southwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, several diplomats said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan Taliban, under Mullah Muhammad Omar, remains </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main tool for leverage in Afghanistan. The arrest of the Taliban's top operational commander, Abdul Ghani Baradar, in January has not led to a broader crackdown against the Afghan insurgents. ''Does it indicate a shift in policy?'' the Western diplomat said, referring to the arrest of Mr. Baradar. ''No. But it's still a good thing.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban reported killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> four months ago, was shown alive and well in an Internet video posting early Monday, warning of suicide revenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on United States cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the first time Mr. Mehsud had been seen since his supposed death in January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video was posted hours after the Pakistani Taliban issued an Internet video asserting responsibility for the Times Square car bomb, a claim that many experts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States dismissed as lacking any credibility because the group has never before conducted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban, an umbrella group of militants, has previously made claims of responsibility for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States that have not been proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonetheless, the videos, produced by the Pakistani Taliban's media arm, Umar Studio, were sure to be an embarrassment to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government, which has suggested that it broke the back of the movement after months of fighting in the border areas that is the militants' stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out a bombing campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the last two years, as well as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan, has links to Al Qaeda and shares a haven in North Waziristan, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, with Qaeda leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first Internet posting, claiming responsibility for the Times Square car bomb, came Sunday in a video on YouTube by Tehreek-e-Taliban, which means Movement of Taliban, with an audio message said to be from Qari Hussein Mehsud, a prominent leader of the umbrella group who is known to have trained cohorts of suicide bombers to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video opened with congratulations to Muslims on the ''jaw-breaking blow to Satan's USA,'' and a note saying, ''We Tehreek-e-Taliban with all the Pride and Bravery, take full responsibility for the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the USA.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hours later came the second video showing Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of Tehreek-e-Taliban, who warned that suicide bombers would soon be directing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at American cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video asserts that it was made on April 4, said the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist Web sites and translates the contents for subscribers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud, flanked by two armed fighters whose faces were covered with white scarves, warned that his movement would soon retaliate against the United States for the many Muslim leaders ''martyred'' in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The time is very near when our fidaeen  will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the American states in their major cities,'' he said, referring to suicide fighters. He went on to say that in a month's time the Muslim community would see the fruit of those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Our fidaeen have penetrated the terrorist America, we will give extremely painful blows to the fanatic America,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban movement in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suffered substantially in fighting with the Pakistani military in the tribal areas over recent months, but Pakistani and American officials recently admitted that Hakimullah Mehsud and the Taliban's suicide bomber trainer, Qari Hussain, had survived </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fact that their media arm is watching and reacting to international events and posting videos on YouTube indicates that at least the media arm of the Pakistani Taliban is still functioning, despite American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Pakistani military operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group does have links to Al Qaeda and may have trained foreign nationals to conduct operations abroad, although is not known for operations beyond Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group's most spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was by a Jordanian double agent, Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, who killed eight people, including four senior C.I.A. officials, in a suicide bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at in a military base in Khost, eastern Afghanistan, in December. A video showing Hakimullah Mehsud and the Jordanian together claiming responsibility before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was disseminated on jihadi Web sites afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the Pakistani Taliban has also made far-fetched claims of responsibility for other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States, including a shooting on an immigrant center in Binghamton, N.Y., in April 2009, although no connection to the Taliban was found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is by Mark Mazzetti, Sabrina Tavernise and Jack Healy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani-American man arrested in the failed Times Square car bombing has admitted his role in the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said he received explosives training in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the authorities said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The man, Faisal Shahzad, 30, was arrested as he tried to flee the country in a Dubai-bound jet late Monday. Hours later, there were reports that seven or eight people had been arrested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as officials in both countries sought to determine the origins and scope of the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad was charged on Tuesday with several terrorism-related crimes. American intelligence officials said that while any ties Mr. Shahzad had to international terrorist groups remained murky, investigators were strongly looking at possible links to the Pakistani Taliban in the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the role is confirmed, it would be the group's first effort to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States and the first sign of the group's ability to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets beyond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban is a different organization from the Taliban groups that the United States is battling in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad's ability to board an international flight despite being the target of a major terrorism investigation was the result of at least two lapses in the response by the government and the airline, Emirates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad, a naturalized United States citizen from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who lived in Bridgeport, Conn., was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and other federal charges, several related to explosives. He was interrogated without initially being read his Miranda rights under a public safety exception, and he provided what the Federal Bureau of Investigation called ''valuable intelligence and evidence.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He continued talking after being read his rights, the F.B.I. said. The authorities charged him as a civilian, but he did not appear in court and no hearing has been scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is clear that this was a terrorist plot aimed at murdering Americans in one of the busiest places in the country,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference on Tuesday in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad booked a ticket on his way to Kennedy Airport and bought it with cash when he got there, officials said. He had boarded the plane but was taken off before it taxied away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Investigators had been trying to find Mr. Shahzad after determining that he was the man who bought a Nissan Pathfinder from a Connecticut woman last month and had parked it just off Broadway on Saturday night packed with gasoline, propane, fertilizer and fireworks. No one was hurt, but officials said the bomb could have been deadly on the crowded streets if it had ignited. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said Mr. Shahzad had been placed on a no-fly list on Monday afternoon, but they declined to explain how he had been allowed to board the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Isuzu Trooper that Mr. Shahzad had apparently driven to the airport was found in a parking lot. Inside the Trooper, investigators discovered a Kel-Tec 9-millimeter pistol, with a folding stock and a rifle barrel, along with several spare magazines of ammunition, an official said. Fearing the Izuzu might be rigged to explode, officials briefly cordoned off the area around it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of the passengers were taken off the plane, and they, their luggage and the Boeing 777 were screened before the flight was allowed to depart, about seven hours late, at 6:29 a.m. Two other men were also interviewed by the authorities but released, according to one law enforcement official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holder said Mr. Shahzad had been providing ''useful information'' to federal investigators since he was pulled off the plane. Besides saying that he had received training in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Shahzad said he had acted alone, a claim that was still being investigated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, developments unfolded quickly. Officials identified one of those arrested as Tauhid Ahmed and said he had been in touch with Mr. Shahzad through e-mail and had met him either in the United States or in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another man arrested, Muhammad Rehan, had spent time with Mr. Shahzad during a recent visit there, Pakistani officials said. Mr. Rehan was arrested in Karachi just after morning prayers at a mosque known for its links with the militant group Jaish-e-Muhammad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Investigators said Mr. Rehan told them that he had rented a pickup truck and driven with Mr. Shahzad to the northwestern city of Peshawar, where they stayed from July 7 to July 22, 2009. The account could not be independently verified. Mr. Shahzad spent four months in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, the authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials promised to aid the United States ''in bringing such culprits to justice,'' the Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, said in a telephone interview as he announced the seven or eight arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad is believed to be originally from Kashmir and is among a handful of Pakistani-Americans who have recently faced terrorism accusations in the United States or abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban on Sunday released a video taking credit for the Times Square </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but American officials cautioned on Tuesday that the investigation was still in its early stages, and said it could take days before enough evidence emerged to point to any one group for its role in the plot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For months, terrorist groups have pledged to exact revenge for the Central Intelligence Agency's campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Pakistani mountains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed the Pakistani Taliban's leader, Baitullah Mehsud, and American intelligence officials believe that the group has over the years cultivated close ties to Qaeda leaders. Any ties between Mr. Shahzad and Pakistani militants could add new urgency to American demands that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> root out the web of Al Qaeda and local groups that use the tribal areas to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at United States troops in Afghanistan and other targets farther abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States, which has provided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with billions of dollars in counterterrorism aid since 2001, has pressed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to crack down on militants inside its borders, and an American official said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> response to this attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have serious implications for the country's strategic relationship with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A detailed 10-page court document outlining the criminal charges describes new details about Mr. Shahzad's actions in the days leading up to the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including how he bought the Nissan Pathfinder that would ultimately help lead investigators to him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It says that Customs and Border Protection records show that Mr. Shahzad returned from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Feb. 3, 2010, after a five-month visit there, flying back on a one-way ticket from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He told customs inspectors, the complaint said, that he was visiting his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The complaint, sworn out by Andrew P. Pachtman, an F.B.I. agent assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, says that Mr. Shahzad used a prepaid cellular telephone to contact a Connecticut woman who had placed an online advertisement to sell the vehicle. It described how the phone led investigators to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He received four calls from a number in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hours before he bought the vehicle, the complaint says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The prepaid cellular phone, according to the complaint, was also used to call a fireworks store in Pennsylvania that sells M-88 firecrackers like those that were used as part of the bomb. The phone was last used on April 28, according to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Connecticut towns of Shelton and Bridgeport, where Mr. Shahzad had lived, residents described Mr. Shahzad as quiet and unremarkable. One of the last to see him was his landlord, Stanislaw Chomiak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About three months ago, Mr. Shahzad signed a one-year lease on a second-floor two-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport. Mr. Chomiak usually saw Mr. Shahzad only when the rent was due, but Mr. Chomiak described his tenant as a nice guy who furnished his apartment sparsely and had claimed he made a living selling jewelry in New Haven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the evening of the attempted bombing in Times Square, the landlord received a phone call from Mr. Shahzad, who said he was riding the train back from New York City and needed to be let into his apartment because he had lost his keys. Mr. Chomiak lent Mr. Shahzad spare keys, with the two men agreeing to meet up the next day to return them, Mr. Chomiak said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He looked nervous, but I thought, of course he's nervous, he just lost his keys,'' Mr. Chomiak, 44, said in an interview at his home, about 15 miles outside of Bridgeport. The men did not end up meeting until about 4 p.m. on Monday, and Mr. Shahzad returned the keys. It was the last time the landlord saw him, and less than eight hours later, Mr. Shahzad was boarding the flight to Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An official in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Ministry said Mr. Shahzad came to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in April 2009 and departed on Aug. 5 on an Emirates flight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference on Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the attempted bombing ''an act that was designed to kill innocent civilians and designed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fear into the hearts of Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, a Pakistani-American man, David C. Headley, pleaded guilty to helping plan the 2008 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India. And last December, five young men from Virginia, two of them with Pakistani backgrounds, were arrested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on accusations of plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against targets there and in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At his news conference, Mr. Bloomberg warned against any backlash against Pakistanis or Muslims in New York, saying, ''We will not tolerate any bias.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- American officials said Wednesday that it was very likely that a radical group once thought unable to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States had played a role in the bombing attempt in Times Square, elevating concerns about whether other militant groups could deliver at least a glancing blow on American soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said that after two days of intense questioning of the bombing suspect, Faisal Shahzad, evidence was mounting that the group, the Pakistani Taliban, had helped inspire and train Mr. Shahzad in the months before he is alleged to have parked an explosives-filled sport utility vehicle in a busy Manhattan intersection on Saturday night. Officials said Mr. Shahzad had discussed his contacts with the group, and investigators had accumulated other evidence that they would not disclose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, Mr. Shahzad, the 30-year-old son of a retired senior Pakistani Air Force officer, waived his right to a speedy arraignment, a possible sign of his continuing cooperation with investigators. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As his interrogation continued, Department of Homeland Security officials directed airlines to speed up their checks of new names added to the no-fly list, a requirement that might have prevented Mr. Shahzad from boarding a flight to Dubai on Monday night before his arrest at Kennedy International Airport. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The failed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has produced a flurry of other proposals to tighten security procedures, including calls by members of Congress to more closely scrutinize passengers who buy tickets with cash, as Mr. Shahzad did. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, proposed stripping terrorism suspects of American citizenship, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg asked Congress to block the sale of firearms and explosives to those on terrorist watch lists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials, speaking about the continuing inquiry only on condition of anonymity, gave few details about what Mr. Shahzad had told investigators, and said their understanding of the plot would evolve as a dragnet spanning two continents gathered more evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One senior Obama administration official cautioned that ''there are no smoking guns yet'' that the Pakistani Taliban had directed the Times Square bombing. But others said that there were strong indications that Mr. Shahzad knew some members of the group and that they probably had a role in training him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a video on Sunday, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One issue that investigators are vigorously pursuing is who provided Mr. Shahzad cash to buy the S.U.V. and his plane ticket to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. ''Somebody's financially sponsoring him, and that's the link we're pursuing,'' one official said. ''And that would take you on the logic train back to Pak-Taliban authorizations,'' the official said, referring to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said it had become increasingly difficult to separate the operations of the militant groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. The region, they said, has become a stew of like-minded organizations plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Pakistani cities, across the border into Afghanistan, and on targets in Western Europe and the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda, groups operating in the tribal areas are the Haqqani Network and the Kashmiri groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is no doubt among intelligence officials that the barrage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past year has made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban, which goes by the name Tehrik-i-Taliban, increasingly determined to seek revenge by finding any way possible to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which was accelerated in 2008 and expanded by President Obama last year, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Washington in part because it was perceived as eliminating dangerous militants while keeping Americans safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in December on a C.I.A. base in Afghanistan, and now possibly the failed S.U.V. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Manhattan, are reminders that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> very success may be provoking a costly response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last March, when the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud boasted that his group was planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Washington that would ''amaze everyone in the world,'' many American officials dismissed his claims as empty bravado. His network, they said, had neither the resources nor the reach to pull off an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> far beyond its base in the mountains of western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday has forced something of a reassessment, especially as American officials see militant groups determined to score a propaganda victory by pulling off even the crudest of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the Pakistani Taliban was involved in the Times Square bombing plot, the organization is only the latest militant group to expand beyond a local political agenda and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States. The Christmas Day attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner, for instance, was traced to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, whose primary targets had previously been the Saudi and Yemeni governments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for such a group, trying for the biggest prize in the jihadist universe -- a successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil -- could have significant payoffs, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The message may be, '' 'The U.S. is pounding us with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but we're powerful enough to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> back'; it's certainly enough to attract ever more recruits to replace those they're losing,'' Mr. Hoffman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban has used a relentless campaign of violence to undermine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secular government. The group has been blamed for the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, as well as bombings in Islamabad, Lahore and elsewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As casualties from the Taliban mounted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2008, officials there pleaded with Washington to begin striking the group with C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. American counterterrorism officials had never considered the group to be a top priority, but last year the Obama administration approved targeted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Pakistani Taliban leaders, in part to win Islamabad's tacit approval for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elsewhere in the tribal areas. Mr. Mehsud himself was killed in a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American officials bristled at the idea that the United States had not taken the Pakistani Taliban threat seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've been pounding their leadership, including figures like Baitullah Mehsud, and their training camps and other facilities,'' one American counterterrorism official said. ''Those actions have probably taken other people like Shahzad off the board.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Denis McDonough, the chief of staff for the National Security Council, said the Times Square attempted bombing showed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States faced a common enemy, calling it ''a pretty stark reminder that the same collection of terrorists that are threatening them are threatening us.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration has been in intensive contact with the Pakistani government, delivering the message that ''there are clear links to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that we would fully expect them to do what they should do,'' the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said. Pakistani officials have arrested about a dozen people they believe may be linked to the plot, the authorities have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, the American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, met with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and spoke by phone with the interior minister, A. Rehman Malik. The administration's special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Richard C. Holbrooke, also spoke by phone with Mr. Qureshi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The key here is that we're touching the right bases politically, and we're getting the right signals back,'' a senior official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tracking of Mr. Shahzad and his links to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began with a fortunate match of phone numbers, a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One number that he had provided when he last entered the United States, in February, was stored in a Customs and Border Protection database. It turned out to match a number on the list of calls to and from a prepaid cellphone that investigators knew belonged to the purchaser of the S.U.V. found on Times Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only when they matched the phone numbers did investigators learn ''that that was the guy we were looking for,'' said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The name match allowed security officials to discover Mr. Shahzad aboard the flight to Dubai minutes before takeoff on Monday night. He had been added to the no-fly list at 12:30 p.m. that day, when airlines were directed to check the list for updates. But Emirates airline did not look at the updated list, and sold Mr. Shahzad a ticket for cash at 7:35 p.m. on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Airlines had been required to check the no-fly list for updates only every 24 hours. The new rule requires that they check within two hours of receiving notification that a high-priority name has been added to the list, Homeland Security officials said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The Pakistani Taliban, which American investigators suspect were behind the attempt to bomb Times Square, have in recent years combined forces with Al Qaeda and other groups, threatening to extend their reach and ambitions, Western diplomats, intelligence officials and experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the group's formation in 2007, the main mission of the Pakistani Taliban has been to maintain their hold on territory in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to train fighters for jihad against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan and, increasingly, to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Pakistani state as the military pushes into these havens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military offensives and intensifying American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have degraded their capabilities. But the Pakistani Taliban have sustained themselves through alliances with any number of other militant groups, splinter cells, foot soldiers and guns-for-hire in the areas under their control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those groups have ''morphed,'' a Western diplomat said in a recent interview. Their common agenda, training and resource sharing have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish one from another. The alliances have also added to their skills and tactics and list of shared targets. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They trade bomb makers and people around,'' a senior United States intelligence official said Thursday in an interview. ''It's becoming this witches' brew.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The senior intelligence official said that in recent years the overall ability and lethality of these groups had dropped, but that the threat to individual countries like the United States had increased somewhat because the groups cooperated against a range of targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not least among the groups is Al Qaeda, which is exerting growing influence over the others. The Pakistani Taliban increasingly serve as its fig leaf, some experts said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban is the local partner of Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Amir Rana, the director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Institute for Peace Studies, who has tracked militant networks for years. ''It has no capacity for an international agenda on its own.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda was one of a number of groups, including the Afghan Taliban, that relocated across the border to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas after the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has said for months that it has broken the back of the Pakistani Taliban since it began operations in the Swat Valley, Bajaur and South Waziristan, among other places. But the top leadership of the militant group remains at large and has sought new refuge largely in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a video released on Sunday, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing. But on Thursday a spokesman for the group disavowed responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Tehrik-i-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has had no links with Faisal Shahzad whatsoever,'' the spokesman, Azam Tariq, said in a phone call to reporters in Peshawar from an undisclosed location. ''We never imparted training to him, nor had he ever come to us.'' The Pakistani Taliban are formally known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he did reiterate the claim of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, that the group had placed suicide bombers in the United States, who, he said, would carry out their mission at an opportune time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban have tried to instill unity among the tribal and criminal militant groups that sprang up in the border regions. That has met with limited success. But they facilitate all the groups in that they hold territory, particularly in North and South Waziristan, where they  run training camps and provide sanctuary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The various tribes and clans within the Pakistani Taliban tend to be tied to their local areas and do not have the broad reach to recruit and run operatives beyond their territory. ''Even Tehrik-i-Taliban is divided into many factions, or every faction has at some level collaboration and coordination,'' Mr. Rana said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, leaders within the Taliban run training camps in many places along </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> western border area, and it is possible that the bombing suspect, Faisal Shahzad, received instruction there with any one of the groups, analysts said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are training camps all over North and South Waziristan,'' the Western diplomat said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ties between the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda stretch back to the Pakistani Taliban's earliest leaders, said Brig. Mahmood Shah, who served as the senior security official in the tribal areas until 2005. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the first, Nek Muhammad,  who was killed in an American airstrike in 2004, was known to be a Qaeda facilitator, providing logistics and lodging for Arabs in Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2008, Brigadier Shah said, the Pakistani Taliban leader at the time, Baitullah Mehsud, and Al Qaeda's No. 2, the Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahri, met in  South Waziristan. That meeting represented an important shift for the Pakistani Taliban, which had until then answered to the Afghan Taliban and militant commanders loyal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the U.S. that Baitullah Mehsud came directly under Al Qaeda,'' Brigadier Shah said. ''The Pakistani government was very sure that he was Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who controls a large fief in North Waziristan, also recently indicated support for Al Qaeda's agenda when answering questions in an open forum on a jihadist Web site, praising jihadi fighters in Iraq and the Palestinian territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adding to the mix, these groups have been fortified by a growing number of militants who have moved to the tribal areas from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest province, Punjab. The Punjabi groups were originally founded and sponsored by the Pakistani military to support the fight with India over the control of Kashmir. But many have turned against the state since the army's siege against militants at the Red Mosque in  Islamabad in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Punjabi groups have surpassed many of their peers in the technical ability and the viciousness of their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But members can often move among the groups or be members of groups simultaneously, Mr. Rana said. They cross-fertilize each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, it is possible that the Times Square bombing suspect, Mr. Shahzad, began his journey to the tribal areas for training by making contact first, possibly in the southern port of Karachi, with militants from one of these groups, Jaish-e-Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, a Pakistani security official said four Jaish militants, whom he did not name, had been picked up and were being interrogated by American and Pakistani officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Mr. Shahzad could easily have been recruited or sought out by any one of the Punjabi groups, which have deep influence in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The kind of knowledge that he demonstrated in his bomb making is very simple knowledge, so how did he come by that? He could have interacted with some militant; it does not need long training,'' said Hasan Askar Rizvi, a military analyst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He may have gone to Waziristan for inspiration or motivation, but did not necessarily get the training there,'' he added. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In the weeks after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the eloquent 30-year-old imam of a mosque outside Washington became a go-to Muslim cleric for reporters scrambling to explain Islam. He condemned the mass murder, invited television crews to follow him around and patiently explained the rituals of his religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We came here to build, not to destroy,'' the cleric, Anwar al-Awlaki, said in a sermon. ''We are the bridge between Americans and one billion Muslims worldwide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first glance, it seemed plausible that this lanky, ambitious man, with the scholarly wire-rims and equal command of English and Arabic, could indeed be such a bridge. CD sets of his engaging lectures on the Prophet Muhammad were in thousands of Muslim homes. American-born, he had a sense of humor, loved deep-sea fishing, had dabbled in get-rich-quick investment schemes and dropped references to ''Joe Sixpack'' into his sermons. A few weeks before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he had preached in the United States Capitol.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nine years later, from his hide-out in Yemen, Mr. Awlaki has declared war on the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil,'' he said in a statement posted on extremist Web sites in March. Though he had spent 21 of his 39 years in the United States, he added, ''I eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His mix of scripture and vitriol has helped lure young Muslims into a dozen plots. He cheered on the Fort Hood gunman and had a role in prompting the attempted airliner bombing on Dec. 25, intelligence officials say. And last week, Faisal Shahzad, who is charged in the attempted bombing in Times Square, told investigators that Mr. Awlaki's prolific online lectures urging jihad as a religious duty helped inspire him to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a time of new concern about the attraction of Western Muslims to violent extremism, there is no figure more central than Mr. Awlaki, who has harnessed the Internet for the goals of Al Qaeda. Counterterrorism officials are gravely concerned about his powerful appeal for many others who are following his path to radicalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's a magnetic character,'' said Philip Mudd, a veteran of the C.I.A.'s Counterterrorism Center who just stepped down after nearly five years as a top F.B.I. intelligence adviser. ''He's a powerful orator in a revolutionary movement.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Convinced that he is a lethal threat, the United States government has responded in kind. This year Mr. Awlaki became the first American citizen on the C.I.A.'s list of terrorists approved as a target for killing, a designation that has only enhanced his status with admirers like Shahidur Rahman, 27, a British Muslim of Bangladeshi descent who studied with Mr. Awlaki in London in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other clerics equivocated about whether terrorist violence could be reconciled with Islam, Mr. Rahman said, but even seven years ago Mr. Awlaki made clear that he had few such qualms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He said suicide is not allowed in Islam,'' Mr. Rahman said in an interview, ''but self-sacrifice is different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are two conventional narratives of Mr. Awlaki's path to jihad. The first is his own: He was a nonviolent moderate until the United States attacked Muslims openly in Afghanistan and Iraq, covertly in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Yemen, and even at home, by making targets of Muslims for raids and arrests. He merely followed the religious obligation to defend his faith, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What am I accused of?'' he asks  in a recent video bearing the imprint of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. ''Of calling for the truth? Of calling for jihad for the sake of Allah? Of calling to defend the causes of the Islamic nation?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A contrasting version of Mr. Awlaki's story, explored though never confirmed by the national Sept. 11 commission, maintains that he was a secret agent of Al Qaeda starting well before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when three of the hijackers turned up at his mosques. By this account, all that has changed since then is that Mr. Awlaki has stopped hiding his true views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tale that emerges from visits to his mosques, and interviews with two dozen people who knew him, is more complex and elusive. A product both of Yemen's deeply conservative religious culture and freewheeling American ways, he hesitated to shake hands with women but patronized prostitutes. He was first enthralled with jihad as a teenager -- but the cause he embraced, the defeat of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, was then America's cause too. After a summer visit to the land of the victorious mujahedeen, he brought back an Afghan hat and wore it proudly around the Colorado State campus in Fort Collins where he studied engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, Mr. Awlaki seems to have tried out multiple personas: the representative of a tolerant Islam in a multicultural United States (starring in a WashingtonPost.com video explaining Ramadan); the fiery American activist talking about Muslims' constitutional rights (and citing both Malcolm X and H. Rap Brown); the conspiracy theorist who publicly doubtedthe Muslim role in the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (The F.B.I., he wrote a few days afterward, simply blamed passengers with Muslim names.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All along he remained a conservative, fundamentalist preacher who invariably started with a scriptural story from the seventh century and drew its personal or political lessons for today, a tradition called salafism, for the Salafs, or ancestors, the leaders of the earliest generations of Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, after the Yemeni authorities, under American pressure, imprisoned him in 2006 and 2007, Mr. Awlaki seems to have hardened into a fully committed ideologist of jihad, condemning non-Muslims and cheerleading for slaughter. His message has become indistinguishable from that of Osama bin Laden -- except for his excellent English and his cultural familiarity with the United States and Britain. Those traits make him especially dangerous, counterterrorism officials fear, and he flaunts them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Jihad,'' Mr. Awlaki said  in a March statement, ''is becoming as American as apple pie and as British as afternoon tea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Skinny Teenager With Brains'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Twenty years ago, long before the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the wars that followed, a shy freshman named Anwar turned up at the little mosque in a converted church a short walk from the Colorado State campus. His American accentwas misleading: born in New Mexico in 1971, when his father was studying agriculture there, he had lived in the United States until the age of 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he had spent his adolescence in Yemen, where memorizing the Koran was a matter of course for an educated young man, and women were largely excluded from public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His father, Nasser, was a prominent figure who would serve as agriculture minister and chancellor of two universities and who was close to President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the country's authoritarian leader. Anwar was sent to Azal Modern School, among the country's most prestigious private schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I recall Anwar as a skinny teenager with brains,'' said Walid al-Saqaf, a neighbor in the 1980s in Sana, the Yemeni capital. For boys of their generation, Afghanistan and its fight to oust the godless Soviet Army was the greatest cause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There was constant talk of the heroes who were leaving Yemen to join the fight and become martyrs and go to paradise,'' recalled Mr. Saqaf, now a doctoral student in Sweden. In the Awlakis' neighborhood, families would gather to watch the latest videotapes of the mujahedeen, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Nasser al-Awlaki had other ideas for his son, who studied civil engineering in Colorado in preparation for the kind of technocratic career his father had pursued. There was one odd note, given the family's relative wealth: just after arriving, Anwar applied for aSocial Security number and claimed falsely he had been born in Yemen, evidently to qualify for scholarship money reserved for foreign citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yusuf Siddiqui, a fellow student who was active with Mr. Awlaki in the mosque and the Muslim Student Association, said there were regular reminders of his Yemeni upbringing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you made some pop culture reference, he might not recognize it,'' Mr. Siddiqui said. Once, Anwar astonished his Americanized friends by climbing a nearby mountain barefoot. ''He just said, 'That's how we do it in Yemen,''' Mr. Siddiqui recalled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Accustomed to Yemeni mores, he was not comfortable interacting with women. Once, when a female American student stopped by the Muslim Student Association to ask for help with math homework, ''He said to me in a low tone of voice, 'Why don't you do it?''' Mr. Siddiqui said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Awlaki was neither among the most conservative Muslim students nor among the libertines who tossed aside religious restrictions on drinking and sex. He ran successfully for president of the Muslim Student Association against a Saudi student who was far stricter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I remember Anwar saying, 'He would want your mom to cover her face. I'm not like that,''' Mr. Siddiqui said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His vacation trip to Afghanistan, around the time the Soviet-backed Communist government fell from power, appears to have brought a new interest in the nexus of politics and religion. He wore an Eritrean T-shirt and the Afghan hat and quoted Abdullah Azzam, a prominent Palestinian scholar who provided theological justification for the Afghan jihad and was later known as a mentor to Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, at the Islamic Center of Fort Collins, the little mosque where volunteers took turns giving the Friday sermon, Mr. Awlaki discovered a knack for preaching. If he could boast of no deep scholarship, he knew the Koran and the sayings of the prophet, spoke fluent English and had a light touch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was very knowledgeable,'' said Mumtaz Hussain, 71, a Pakistani immigrant active in the mosque for two decades. ''He was an excellent person -- very nice, dedicated to religion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He expressed no anti-American sentiments, said Mr. Hussain, whose son served in the National Guard. ''This is our motherland now. People would not tolerate sermons of that kind,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Years later, on his blog, Mr. Awlaki would compare Thomas Gradgrind, Charles Dickens's notoriously utilitarian headmaster in ''Hard Times,'' ''to some Muslim parents who are programmed to think that only medicine or engineering are worthy professions for their children.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It sounds like a hint at his own experience, and some family acquaintances say there was tension between Anwar and his father over career choices. But in 1994, Mr. Awlaki married a cousin from Yemen -- whom by custom he did not introduce to his male friends -- left behind engineering, and took a part-time job as imam at the Denver Islamic Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'He Had a Beautiful Tongue'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like many an evangelical Christian pastor, Mr. Awlaki preached against vice and sin, lauded family values and parsed the scripture, winning fans and rising to successively larger mosques. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Denver, however, there was an episode that might have been an omen. A Saudi student at the University of Denver told an elder that he had decided, with Mr. Awlaki's encouragement, to travel to Chechnya to join the jihad against the Russians. The elder, a Palestinian American in his 60s, thought it ill advised and confronted Mr. Awlaki in a loud argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He had a beautiful tongue,'' recalled the elder, who asked not to be named. ''But I told him: 'Don't talk to my people about jihad.' He left two weeks later.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At 25, he landed for five years at Arribat al-Islami, a stucco building with blue-green tile under a towering palm tree at the edge of San Diego. ''He lit up when he was with the youth,'' said Jamal Ali, 40, an airport driver. He played soccer with younger children and took teenagers paintballing. ''I saw him evolving in trying to understand where he fit into Islam,'' Mr. Ali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lincoln W. Higgie III, 71, an art dealer who lived across quiet Saranac Street from the mosque and the small adjoining house where Mr. Awlaki lived with his wife and two toddlers, recalls an engaging neighbor who apologized about parking problems that came with the flood of Friday worshipers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursdays, Mr. Higgie remembered, Mr. Awlaki liked to go fishing for albacore, and he would often bring over a sample of the catch, deliciously prepared by his wife. The Awlakis' son and daughter would play on Mr. Higgie's floor, chasing his pet macaw, while the men compared notes on their travels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I remember he was very partial to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul,'' Mr. Higgie said. He detected no hostility to non-Muslims, no simmering resentment against America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his private life, he was not always puritanical. Even as he preached about the sanctity of marriage amid the temptations of American life (''especially in Western societies, every haram is available,'' he said, using the Arabic word for the forbidden), he was picked up twice by the San Diego police for soliciting prostitutes; he was given probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He displayed a very American entrepreneurial streak, exploring a possible business importing Yemeni honey and attending seminars in Las Vegas focused on investing in gold and minerals (and once losing $20,000 lent by relatives). Eventually a regular at the mosque proposed a venture that would prove hugely successful: recording Mr. Awlaki's lectures on CD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Starting in 2000, Mr. Awlaki would record a series of highly popular boxed sets -- three, totaling 53 CDs, devoted to the ''Life of Muhammad'' alone; others covering the lesser prophets of Islam (including Moses and Jesus), the companions of the prophet and an account of the hereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The recordings appear free of obvious radicalism. (IslamicBookstore.com has added a notice to its Web listings of Mr. Awlaki's work, saying the recording ''has been reviewed and does not contain any extremist statements.'') </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shakir Muhammad, a Fort Collins engineer who is active in the mosque there, said he became a fan of the CD sets, finding them enthralling even on repeated listening. Only once did a passage give him pause; Mr. Awlaki discussed suicidal violence and did not quite condemn it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I thought, 'This guy may be for it,''' Mr. Muhammad said. ''It bothered me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Mysterious Goodbye</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One day in August 2001, Mr. Awlaki knocked at the door of Mr. Higgie, his neighbor, to say goodbye. He had moved the previous year to Virginia, becoming imam at the far bigger Dar al-Hijrah mosque, and he had returned to pick up a few things he had left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Mr. Higgie tells it, he told the imam to stop by if he was ever in the area -- and got a strange response. ''He said, 'I don't think you'll be seeing me. I won't be coming back to San Diego again. Later on you'll find out why,''' Mr. Higgie said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next month, when Al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington, Mr. Higgie remembered the exchange and was shaken, convinced that his friendly neighbor had some advance warning of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, the F.B.I. had first taken an interest in Mr. Awlaki in 1999, concerned about brushes with militants that to this day remain difficult to interpret. In 1998 and 1999, he was a vice president of a small Islamic charity that an F.B.I. agent later testified was ''a front organization to funnel money to terrorists.'' He had been visited by Ziyad Khaleel, a Qaeda operative who purchased a battery for Osama bin Laden's satellite phone, as well as by an associate of Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik, who was serving a life sentence for plotting to blow up New York landmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still more disturbing was Mr. Awlaki's links to two future Sept. 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhazmi. They prayed at his San Diego mosque and were seen in long conferences with the cleric. Mr. Alhazmi would follow the imam to his new mosque in Virginia, and 9/11 investigators would call Mr. Awlaki Mr. Alhazmi's ''spiritual adviser.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The F.B.I., whose agents interviewed Mr. Awlaki four times in the days after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concluded that his contacts with the hijackers and other radicals were random, the inevitable consequence of living in the small world of Islam in America. But records of the 9/11 commission at the National Archives make clear that not all investigators agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One detective, whose name has been redacted, told the commission he believed Mr. Awlaki ''was at the center of the 9/11 story.'' An F.B.I. agent, also unidentified, said that ''if anyone had knowledge of the plot, it would have been'' the cleric, since ''someone had to be in the U.S. and keep the hijackers spiritually focused.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 9/11 commission staff members themselves had sharp arguments about him. ''Do I think he played a role in helping the hijackers here, knowing they were up to something?'' said one staff member, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. ''Yes. Do I think he was sent here for that purpose? I have no evidence for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The separate Congressional Joint Inquiry into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected that Mr. Awlaki might have been part of a support network for the hijackers, said Eleanor Hill, its director. ''There's no smoking gun. But we thought somebody ought to investigate him,'' Ms. Hill said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alarmed about Mr. Awlaki's possible Sept. 11 connections, a State Department investigator, Raymond Fournier, found a circuitous way to charge Mr. Awlaki with passport fraud, based on his false claim after entering the United States in 1990 that he had been born in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A warrant was issued, but prosecutors in Colorado rescinded it, concluding that no criminal case could be made. Mr. Awlaki returned from a trip abroad in October 2002 -- an act some colleagues say was evidence for his innocence of any 9/11 role -- for what would prove to be his last stay in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During that trip, he visited Ali al-Timimi, a Virginia cleric later convicted for encouraging Muslims to join the fight against American troops in Afghanistan. Mr. Awlaki ''attempted to get al-Timimi to discuss issues related to the recruitment of young Muslims,'' according to a motion filed in his criminal case. Mr. Timimi wondered if Mr. Awlaki might be trying to entrap him at the F.B.I.'s instigation, his friends say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if Mr. Awlaki was cooperating with the government, it would have astonished his associates. As the American authorities rounded up Muslim men after 9/11, he had grown furious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After raids in March 2002 on Muslim institutions and community leaders in Virginia, Mr. Awlaki led a chorus of outrage, noting that some of the targets were widely viewed as moderates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So this is not now a war on terrorism, we need to all be clear about this, this is a war on Muslims!'' Mr. Awlaki declared, his voice shaking with anger. ''Not only is it happening worldwide, but it's happening right here in America that is claiming to be fighting this war for the sake of freedom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Around that time, Johari Abdul-Malik, a former Howard University chaplain who was joining the staff at Mr. Awlaki's Virginia mosque, met him at a cafe. Mr. Awlaki said he planned to leave the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I tried to convince him that the atmosphere was not as bad as he thought, that it was a positive time for outreach,'' Mr. Abdul-Malik recalled. But Mr. Awlaki was shaken by what he saw as an anti-Muslim backlash. And always fond of the limelight, Mr. Abdul-Malik said, Mr. Awlaki was looking for a bigger platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He said he might have a TV show for the gulf,'' Mr. Abdul-Malik said. ''He might run for Parliament in Yemen. Or he might teach.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Never Trust a Kuffar'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a bare lecture room in London, where Mr. Awlaki moved after leaving the United States, he addressed his rapt, young followers, urging them never to believe a non-Muslim, or kuffar in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The important lesson to learn here is never, ever trust a kuffar,'' he said, chopping the air, his lecture caught on video. ''Do not trust them!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unbelievers are ''plotting to kill this religion,'' he declared. ''They're plotting night and day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If he had the same knowing tone and touches of humor as in earlier sermons, his message was more conspiratorial. You can't believe CNN, the United Nations, or Amnesty International, he told his students, because they, too, were part of the war on Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We need to wisen up and not be duped,'' Mr. Awlaki said. ''Malcolm X said, 'We've been bamboozled.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of his young British Muslim listeners, accustomed to preachers with heavy accents and an otherworldly focus, were entranced by his mix of the ancient and the contemporary, his seamless transition from the 29 battles of the Prophet Muhammad to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ''He was the main man who translated the jihad into English,'' said Abu Yahiya, 27, a Bangladeshi-British student of Mr. Awlaki's lectures in 2003. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a personal level, said Mr. Rahman, one of the students who studied with Mr. Awlaki in 2003, Mr. Awlaki made it clear that they could no longer pretend to be Muslims while going clubbing at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I could not be Mohammed in the morning and 'Mo' in the evening,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Awlaki's demand that they make a choice, devoting themselves to a harsh, fundamentalist strain of Islam, offered clarity, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would hit the audience automatically in their hearts and minds,'' Mr. Rahman said. When others claimed the popular cleric was brainwashing them, Mr. Rahman said, ''When you got a lot of dirt in your brain, you need a washing. I believe he did brainwash me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Awlaki's fame grew, his CDs kept selling, and he traveled around Britain lecturing. But he had a hard time supporting himself, according to people who knew him, and in 2004 he had moved to Yemen to preach and study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-2006, after he intervened in a tribal dispute, Mr. Awlaki was imprisoned for 18 months by the Yemeni authorities. By his later account on his blog, he was in solitary confinement nearly the entire time and used it to study the Koran, to read literature (he enjoyed Dickens but disliked Shakespeare) and eventually, when it was permitted, to study Islamic scholarship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notably, he was enraptured by the works of Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian whose time in the United States helped make him the father of the modern anti-Western jihadist movement in Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because of the flowing style of Sayyid I would read between 100 and 150 pages a day,'' Mr. Awlaki wrote. ''I would be so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me in my cell speaking to me directly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two F.B.I. agents questioned him in the Yemeni prison, and Mr. Awlaki blamed the United States for his prolonged incarceration. He was right; John D. Negroponte, then the director of national intelligence, told Yemeni officials that the United States did not object to his detention, according to American and Yemeni sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by the end of 2007, American officials, some of whom were disturbed at the imprisonment without charges of a United States citizen, signaled that they no longer insisted on Mr. Awlaki's incarceration, and he was released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was different after that -- harder,'' said a Yemeni man who knows Mr. Awlaki well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Awlaki started his own Web site, reaching a larger audience than ever. But finding that he was constantly followed by Yemeni security in Sana, the capital, he moved to the house of an uncle in Shabwa, the rugged southern province and his tribe's traditional turf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last October, friends said, he heard the distant whine of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft circling overhead. Worried that he was endangering his relatives, he fled to the mountains. While his role is unclear in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network's Yemeni affiliate, American officials believe he has become ''operational,'' plotting, not just inspiring, terrorism against the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From his hide-out, Mr. Awlaki sends out the occasional video message. But his reported influence on the Times Square bombing suspect, Mr. Shahzad, suggests that no matter what happens to him, his electronic legacy is secure. His message will endure in hundreds of audio and video clips that his followers have posted to the Web, a mix of religious stories and incitement, awaiting the curious and the troubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Awlaki's transformation has left a trail of bewilderment, apprehension and fury among many people who knew and worshiped with him in the United States. Mr. Siddiqui, his college friend, said he was ''surprised and disappointed.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's turning his back not only on the country where he was born but on his Muslim brothers and sisters in this country,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abdul-Malik said that his former fellow imam at the Virginia mosque ''is a terrorist, in my book'' and that Mr. Awlaki and his like-thinkers were trying to reduce Islam to a ''medieval narrative. It's the Hatfields and the McCoys: you hit me, I hit you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Muslim families have asked whether they should keep Mr. Awlaki's scriptural CDs, Mr. Abdul-Malik said. He tells them it is their decision, but he has advised shops not to carry even the earlier, benign Awlaki material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The Obama administration has delivered new and stiff warnings to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the failed Times Square car bombing that it must urgently move against the nexus of Islamic militancy in the country's lawless tribal regions, American and Pakistani officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, met with the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, at his headquarters here on Friday and urged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to move more quickly in beginning a military offensive against the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda in North Waziristan, Americans and Pakistanis familiar with the visit said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of continuing diplomatic efforts here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani-American man who admitted to the Times Square </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faisal Shahzad, 30, told American investigators that he had received training in North Waziristan, the main base for the Pakistani Taliban, Al Qaeda and other militant groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new pressure from Washington was characterized by both the Pakistani and American officials as a sharp turnaround from the relatively polite encouragement adopted by the Obama administration in recent months. And it comes amid increasing debate within the administration about how to expand the American military's influence -- and even a boots-on-the-ground presence -- on Pakistani soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the bombing in Times Square failed, Mr. Shahzad's ability to move back and forth between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has heightened fears in the Obama administration that another attempt at a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are saying, 'Sorry, if there is a successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we will have to act' '' within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, one of the American officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That issue has been a source of growing tension between the countries. Pakistani officials, already alarmed by the increase in American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have been extremely sensitive about any hint that American ground troops could become involved in the fight. And attempts by the United States to increase the presence of Special Operations forces there even in an advisory or training role have been met with great resistance by the Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has stepped up its campaigns against militants in the past year, including an offensive in South Waziristan that has been praised by American officials. It has said that it is preparing to take up the fight against militants in North Waziristan. But Pakistani officials have insisted that the expanded campaign will happen completely on their own terms, and they have warned the Obama administration not to push so hard that it uses up the good will it has tried to foster here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Americans' urgency has been increasing on multiple fronts. With an intensified American military campaign raging against the Taliban next door in Afghanistan, and now with the renewed evidence of Pakistani sources for plots to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil, it was clear the Pakistani government had to do more, and more urgently, a senior American official said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Kayani, with whom General McChrystal has forged a positive relationship, was essentially told, '' 'You can't pretend any longer that this is not going on,' '' another American official said. '' 'We are saying you have got to go into North Waziristan.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Anne Patterson, met </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, after the failed bombing and used ''forceful'' language to convey the American point that the Pakistanis had to move more assertively against the militants threaded through the society, a Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The element of threat is definitely different from the last few months,'' said Tariq Fatemi, a former Pakistani ambassador who also served in the United States. .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration was planning to use the failed terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to impress on the Pakistanis of the urgency of getting American development aid in place in the tribal areas where militancy thrives, and into Karachi, the biggest city, where radical religious schools, known as madrasas, are popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Last week's incident makes it more urgent and more true'' of the need to bring stability and security to these areas where the militants have multiplied, an American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About $150 million was appropriated by Congress for assistance to the tribal areas in the coming period for reconstruction and other projects. But a host of problems, including American insistence on being able to monitor the money being spent, has made it a slow process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since Mr. Shahzad's arrest in the Times Square </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> each country has, to some extent, blamed the other. Many Pakistanis insist that Mr. Shahzad is an American citizen who was radicalized in the United States by the difficulties he found living there as a Muslim. The Americans stress that Mr. Shahzad has traveled more than a dozen times back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the United States since 1999, and appeared to have received his military training in the epicenter of militancy, North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad's background as the son of a senior Pakistani military officer has embarrassed the Pakistani Army, the most powerful institution in the country, and which receives generous financing from the United States. Mr. Shahzad's father was a vice marshal in the Pakistani Air Force, and it appears that Mr. Shahzad grew up around senior military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Shahzad told American investigators that he was trained in bomb making in North Waziristan, the Pakistani Army tried to play down that claim, portraying it as unlikely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban took initial responsibility for the bombing attempt. Days later, though, their spokesman denied any involvement, a statement that may have been prompted by fears that their early claim of ownership of Mr. Shahzad might result in a direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the North Waziristan enclave by the Americans, or the Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- When President Obama decided last year to narrow the scope of the nine-year war in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he and his aides settled on a formulation that sounded simple: Eviscerate Al Qaeda, but just ''degrade'' the Taliban, reversing that movement's momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, after the bungled car-bombing attempt in Times Square with suspected links to the Pakistani Taliban, a new, and disturbing, question is being raised in Washington: Have the stepped-up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- notably the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- actually made Americans less safe? Have they had the perverse consequence of driving lesser insurgencies to think of targeting Times Square and American airliners, not just Kabul and Islamabad? In short, are they inspiring more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on America than they prevent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a hard question.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the time of Mr. Obama's strategy review, the logic seemed straightforward. Only Al Qaeda had the ambitions and reach to leap the ocean and take the war to America's skies and streets. In contrast, most of the Taliban and other militant groups were regarded as fragmented, regional insurgencies whose goals stuck close to the territory their tribal ancestors have fought over for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Six months and a few attempted bombings later, including the near-miss in New York last weekend, nothing looks quite that simple. As commanders remind each other, in all wars the enemy gets a vote, too. Increasingly, it looks like these enemies have voted to combine talents, if not forces. Last week, a senior American intelligence official was saying that the many varieties of insurgents now make up a ''witches' brew'' of forces, sharing money handlers, communications experts and, most important in recent times, bomb makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, each group still has a separate identity and goal, but those fine distinctions seem less relevant than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The notion that the various groups are at least thinking alike worries Bruce Riedel, who a year ago was a co-author of President Obama's first review of strategy in the region. ''There are two separate movements converging here,'' said Mr. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. ''The ideology of global jihad has been bought into by more and more militants, even guys who never thought much about the broader world. And that is disturbing, because it is a force multiplier for Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Riedel also notes, ''The pressure we've put on them in the past year has also drawn them together, meaning that the network of alliances is getting stronger, not weaker.'' So what seemed like a mission being narrowed by Mr. Obama, focusing on Al Qaeda and its closest associates (which included the Pakistani Taliban), ''now seems like a lot broader mission than it did a year ago.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Figuring out cause-and-effect when it comes to the motivations of Islamic militants is always tricky. Whenever he was asked whether America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were goading Islamic militants into new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bush used to shoot back that neither war was under way on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. When President Obama came into office, the conventional wisdom held that the mere arrival of a black president with some Muslim relatives and an eagerness to engage the Islamic world would be bad news for Al Qaeda and Taliban recruiters. One rarely hears that argument now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A year after Mr. Obama's now-famous speech to the Muslim world from Cairo, Pakistanis talk less about outreach than Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And White House officials say they suspect that their strategy of raising pressure may explain the amateurish nature of the recent bombing attempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants, they argue, no longer enjoy the luxury of time to train their bombers. To linger at training camps is to invite being spotted by a Predator. The tale told to interrogators by Faisal Shahzad, the suspect in the Times Square case, suggests that he hooked up with one set of militants and was passed off to another, and given only cursory bomb-making training. ''He wasn't the greatest student, but they weren't stellar teachers, either,'' a senior administration official said last week, after reviewing the interrogation record. What Mr. Shahzad had was the one thing the insurgents most covet: easy, question-free ability to leave and enter the United States on a valid passport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, the United States might more effectively identify citizens who pose a threat. But, similarly, terrorist groups could find ways to more effectively train recruits. As Mr. Riedel notes: ''You don't need a Ph.D. in electrical engineering to build a car bomb. You don't even need to be literate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, the Pakistani Taliban have set off plenty of car bombs that worked well against the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies. It was those bombings that finally convinced the Pakistani government to go after the group. In Washington, officials differentiate between the relatively young Pakistani Taliban and the Afghan Taliban, which have deep political roots in its country. ''The Pakistani Taliban gets treated like Al Qaeda,'' one senior official said. ''We aim to destroy it. The Afghan Taliban is different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, one Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last summer while receiving a massage on the roof of an apartment building. His successor was believed killed in a similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until he showed up on a recent video. As one American intelligence official said, ''Those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have made it personal for the Pakistani Taliban -- so it's no wonder they are beginning to think about how they can </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> back at targets here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the disappointment of many liberals who thought they were electing an antiwar president, Mr. Obama clearly rejects the argument that if he doesn't stir the hornets' nest, American cities will not get stung. His first year in office he authorized more Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- more than 50 -- than President Bush did in his last four years in office. In December, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama stated that sometimes peace requires war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people,'' he said. Negotiations ''could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, recent history and the politics of a polarized Washington are pushing Mr. Obama to step up the pressure. The civil war that paved the way for the Afghan Taliban began when President George H. W. Bush pulled out of Afghanistan once the Soviets left. The Taliban took power and began sheltering Osama bin Laden on Bill Clinton's watch; as vice president, Dick Cheney often criticized Mr. Clinton's approach to terrorism, saying he dealt with it as a criminal justice issue, not an act of war. The second Bush administration drove the Taliban from power, but the early histories of the Bush years largely agree that the Taliban saw their opportunity to return when the American war on terror refocused on Iraq. Even the United States, they concluded, could not give its all to two wars at once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That narrative helped form Mr. Obama's argument, throughout his presidential campaign, that the Afghan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, not the Sunni triangle in Iraq, was the center of global terrorism. That, he said, was where all </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States and its allies had emanated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, six months after setting his course, Mr. Obama is discovering, on the streets of New York, the deeper meaning of his own words.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missiles struck a region known as Datta Khel on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Afghanistan border where Taliban and Qaeda fighters prepare for operations against United States and NATO troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unusually intense </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the third since a failed car bombing in Times Square 10 days ago. Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American charged in the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has told American investigators that he visited North Waziristan to train with the Pakistani Taliban. There was no indication that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday were retaliation for the bombing attempt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to his account, a missile hit a vehicle carrying four militants, and other missiles slammed into tents erected by the militants in the nearby Zair Ghundai area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everybody here lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But with the arrival of Hamid Karzai, the mendacity blossomed into absurdity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question for the Obama White House is not whether it can grow to appreciate the caped capo who runs Afghanistan. (President Obama can't stand him.) The question is whether Karzai will fall for all the guff they're throwing at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Gen. Stanley McChrystal were paraded into the White House press room to pretend as though their dispute about the efficacy of the surge, given Karzai's serious flaws as a partner, has been put to rest. (It hasn't.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration crooned a reassuring lullaby to the colicky Karzai: that it has a long-term commitment in Afghanistan (it doesn't) and an endgame there (it doesn't) and that it knows that the upcoming Kandahar offensive will work (it doesn't).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked by a reporter about the change from sticks to carrots, Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who has had contentious sessions with Karzai, replied: ''No, I certainly don't think it's changed.'' (It has.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For their part, the Afghans promise to work on stemming corruption and stopping the poppy trade. (They won't.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration is trying to delay the inconvenient truth that Karzai wants reconciliation with Taliban leaders; this makes the U.S. cringe, thinking of Mullah Omar and other 9/11 killers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like a lover who has learned from bitter experience that his fickle mistress responds better to sweets than rants, the administration has abruptly switched from nagging the corrupt Afghan president to nuzzling him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday evening, Karzai was honored at a starry State Department reception along with his ministers -- or at least the ones he could get into the country. He didn't bring his brother, the C.I.A. pal and drug lord, or other especially sleazy government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama, who last month was threatening to rescind the invitation to the maddening dandy, will have an Oval Office meeting and Rose Garden press conference with Karzai on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan leader was also due to be feted Wednesday night at a private dinner at the home of Vice President Biden, who once stalked out of a Karzai supper at the palace in Kabul when the Afghan president claimed there was no corruption, and got furious again last month when Karzai said he would join the Taliban if foreign interference continued. (Translation: Stop upbraiding me, Obama, you're stuck with me.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, Karzai is slated to get a special treat  --  a long, intimate walk in a Georgetown garden with Hillary Clinton  -- the one person in the administration who prides herself on getting along with him. Romantic strolls through gardens, the administration has decided, are the best way to move the corrupt coxcomb to its point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last October, when Karzai was trying to purloin the election with a million illegal votes, John Kerry persuaded him to agree to a runoff by taking a long walk through rosebushes and the presidential mosque on the palace grounds in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Kerry and Hillary bonded with Karzai by confiding how they, too, had felt very wounded by a bruising election experience. ''Sometimes there are tough things,'' Kerry told the Afghan leader. Yeah, like if you had to steal an election twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is training jihadis to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York, belying again W.'s chuckleheaded contention that we have to wage war against terrorists abroad so we don't have to face them at home.  Our battles meant to diminish enemies replenish them. The inept Times Square bomber was infuriated by U.S. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon, the public and administration allies are all expressing frustration with Afghanistan.  A majority in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll says Afghanistan is not worth the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A report by the Center for American Progress run by John Podesta, Bill Clinton's chief of staff who helped lead the Obama transition, faulted the administration, saying it ''has not yet outlined a clear plan for transferring control to the Afghan state or sufficiently prioritized the reforms needed to ensure that it can one day stand on its own.'' A Pentagon report also shows that General McChrystal's boast that he could wheel ''a government in a box'' into Marja was premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon said there had been ''some success in clearing insurgents from their strongholds'' but ''progress in introducing governance and development to these areas to move toward hold and build operations has been slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The insurgents' tactic of re-infiltrating the cleared areas to perform executions has played a role in dissuading locals from siding with the Afghan government, which has complicated efforts to introduce effective governance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A walk in the garden, it's not. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we want Times Square to be safer from terrorists, we need to start by helping make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safer as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People with links to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been behind a hugely disproportionate share of international terror incidents over the last two decades: the 1993 and 2001 World Trade Center </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Reid's failed shoe bombing in 2001; the so-called Bojinka plot in 1995 to blow up 12 planes simultaneously; the 2005 London train and bus bombings; the 2001 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Indian Parliament; and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on two luxury hotels and a Jewish center in Mumbai in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So it came as little surprise that the suspect in the attempted car bombing in Times Square, Faisal Shahzad, is a Pakistani-American. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why does an ostensible ''ally'' seem to constitute more of a threat than, say, Iran? Or Lebanon or Syria or Iraq? Or Egypt, birthplace of the Muslim Brotherhood brand of militant Islam? Or the West Bank and Gaza, where resentment of America's Middle East policies is centered? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One answer, I think, is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American-backed military leader of the 1970s and 1980s, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, drove the country off course, seeking to use fundamentalism as a way to buttress the regime. Instead of investing in education and infrastructure, he invested in religious sanctimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The public education system, in particular, is a catastrophe. I've dropped in on Pakistani schools where the teachers haven't bothered to show up (because they get paid anyway), and where the classrooms have collapsed (leaving students to meet under trees). Girls have been particularly left out. In the tribal areas, female literacy is 3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's an instructive contrast with Bangladesh, which was part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until it split off in 1971. At that time, Bangladesh was Pakistani's impoverished cousin and seemed pretty much hopeless. Henry Kissinger famously described Bangladesh as an ''international basket case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But then Bangladesh began climbing a virtuous spiral by investing in education, of girls in particular. It now has more girls in high school than boys, according to Unicef. This focus on education has bolstered its economy, reduced population growth rates, nurtured civil society and dampened fundamentalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Educated girls formed the basis of a garment industry, making shirts for Americans. This brought in currency, boosted employment and provided an economic lifeline to the country. Those educated girls went to work for poverty-fighting organizations like BRAC and the Grameen Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, you can hear American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buzzing faintly overhead, a reminder of our focus on military solutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and hard power have their place, but not to the exclusion of schools and soft power. An important 2008 study from Rand, ''How Terrorist Groups End,'' concluded that ''military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I can't tell you how frustrating it is on visits to rural </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to see fundamentalist Wahabi-funded madrassas as the only game in town. They offer free meals, and the best students are given further scholarships to study abroad at fundamentalist institutions so that they come back as respected ''scholars.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We don't even compete. Medieval misogynist fundamentalists display greater faith in the power of education than Americans do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's hope this is changing under the Obama administration. It's promising that the Kerry-Lugar-Berman aid package provides billions of dollars for long-term civilian programs in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, although it's still unclear how it will be implemented. One useful signal would be for Washington to encourage Islamabad to send not only troops to North Waziristan but also teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We continue to be oblivious to trade possibilities. Pro-American Pakistanis fighting against extremism have been pleading for years for the United States to cut tariffs on Pakistani garment exports, to nurture the textile industry and stabilize the country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, told me that his top three goals are ''market access, market access, market access.'' But Washington wants to protect North Carolina textile mills, so we won't cut tariffs on Pakistani goods. The technical word for that: myopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Education and lower tariffs are not quick fixes, sometimes not even slow fixes. But they are tools that can help, at the margins, bring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> back from the precipice. It has been reassuring to see the work of people like Greg Mortenson, whose brave school-building in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan was chronicled in ''Three Cups of Tea.'' Ditto for Developments in Literacy, or D.I.L., which builds schools for girls in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that are the most exhilarating things I've seen there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It costs $1,500 to sponsor a D.I.L. classroom for a year, and that's just about the best long-term counterterrorism investment available. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In ''Where To From Here?'' (Week in Review, May 9), you pose a vital policy question: Is the Obama administration's heavy reliance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Taliban leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan inspiring more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on America than they prevent?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there is another downside to a policy based on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aside from engendering more recruits for the global jihad movement: the loss of intelligence from assassinated Taliban and Qaeda leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a growing nexus between American citizens and terrorist groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the United States needs all the information it can muster on the nature of these links, including recruitment practices, training methods and possible future plots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration needs to begin placing a greater priority on capturing and interrogating senior Taliban and Qaeda leaders, rather than executing them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's decision to authorize the killing by the Central Intelligence Agency of a terrorism suspect who is an American citizen has set off a debate over the legal and political limits of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a mainstay of the campaign against terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The notion that the government can, in effect, execute one of its own citizens far from a combat zone, with no judicial process and based on secret intelligence, makes some legal authorities deeply uneasy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To eavesdrop on the terrorism suspect who was added to the target list, the American-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who is hiding in Yemen, intelligence agencies would have to get a court warrant. But designating him for death, as C.I.A. officials did early this year with the National Security Council's approval, required no judicial review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Congress has protected Awlaki's cellphone calls,'' said Vicki Divoll, a former C.I.A. lawyer who now teaches at the United States Naval Academy. ''But it has not provided any protections for his life. That makes no sense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials take the view that no legal or constitutional rights can protect Mr. Awlaki, a charismatic preacher who has said it is a religious duty to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States and who the C.I.A. believes is actively plotting violence. The attempted bombing of Times Square on May 1 is the latest of more than a dozen terrorist plots in the West that investigators believe were inspired in part by Mr. Awlaki's rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''American citizenship doesn't give you carte blanche to wage war against your own country,'' said a counterterrorism official who discussed the classified program on condition of anonymity. ''If you cast your lot with its enemies, you may well share their fate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama, who campaigned for the presidency against George W. Bush-era interrogation and detention practices, has implicitly invited moral and legal scrutiny of his own policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But like the debate over torture during the Bush administration, public discussion of what officials call targeted killing has been limited by the secrecy of the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program. Representative John F.  Tierney, who on April 28 held the first Congressional hearing focused on the lawfulness of targeted killing, said he was determined to air the contentious questions publicly and possibly seek legislation to govern such operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reported targeting of Mr. Awlaki ''certainly raises the question of what rights a citizen has and what steps must be taken before he's put on the list,'' said Mr. Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of a House subcommittee on national security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Counterterrorism officials, with the support of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, say the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have proved to be an extraordinarily successful weapon against militants in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the location of all the known C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> except one in Yemen in 2002. By their count, the missiles have killed more than 500 militants since 2008, and a few dozen nearby civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the fullest administration statement to date, Harold Koh, the State Department's legal adviser, said in a March 24 speech the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda and its allies were lawful as part of the military action authorized by Congress after the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as under the general principle of self-defense. By those rules, he said, such targeted killing was not assassination, which is banned by executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the disclosure last month by news organizations that Mr. Awlaki, 39, had been added to the C.I.A. kill list shifted the terms of the legal debate in several ways. He is located far from hostilities in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the perpetrators of 9/11 are believed to be hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is alleged to be affiliated with a Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda. Intelligence analysts believe that only recently he began to help plot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including the failed attempt to bomb an airliner on Dec. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most significantly, he is an American, born in New Mexico, arguably protected by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee not to be ''deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'' In a traditional war, anyone allied with the enemy, regardless of citizenship, is a legitimate target; German-Americans who fought with the Nazis in World War II were given no special treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Ms. Divoll, the former C.I.A. lawyer, said some judicial process should be required before the government kills an American away from a traditional battlefield. In addition, she offered a practical argument for a review outside the executive branch: avoiding mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She noted media reports that C.I.A. officers in 2004 seized a German citizen, Khaled  el-Masri, and held him in Afghanistan for months before acknowledging that they had grabbed the wrong man. ''What if we had put him on the kill list?'' she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another former C.I.A. lawyer, John Radsan, said prior judicial review of additions to the target list might be unconstitutional. ''That sort of review goes to the core of presidential power,'' he said. But Mr. Radsan, who teaches at the William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, said every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be subject to rigorous internal checks to be ''sure beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the target is an enemy combatant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for the question of whether Mr. Awlaki is a legitimate target, Mr. Radsan said the cleric might not resemble an American fighting in a Nazi uniform. ''But if you imagine him making radio speeches for the Germans in World War II, there's certainly a parallel,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the legal debate is the question of whether killing Mr. Awlaki would be a good idea. Many Muslim activists and scholars say it would accord him martyr status and amplify his violent message. Mohamed Elibiary, a Muslim community advocate in Texas who advises law enforcement on countering extremism, said helping the Yemeni authorities arrest Mr. Awlaki would make more sense. ''I'm not saying this guy shouldn't be treated as an enemy,'' Mr. Elibiary said. ''But there are smarter and stupider ways of eliminating your enemy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say an arrest may not be possible. ''If we need to stop dangerous terrorists who hide in remote parts of the world, inaccessible to U.S. troops, law enforcement, or any central government,'' said the counterterrorism official, ''what do you do -- cover your ears and wait for a truly devastating explosion in Times Square?'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article was reported by Andrea Elliott, Sabrina Tavernise and Anne Barnard, and written by Ms. Elliott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just after midnight on Feb. 25, 2006, Faisal Shahzad sent a lengthy e-mail message to a group of friends. The trials of his fellow Muslims weighed on him -- the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the plight of Palestinians, the publication in Denmark of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad was wrestling with how to respond. He understood the notion that Islam forbids the killing of innocents, he wrote. But to those who insist only on ''peaceful protest,'' he posed a question: ''Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from west. Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet by some measures, Mr. Shahzad -- a Pakistani immigrant who was then 26 years old -- seemed to be thriving in the West. He worked as a financial analyst at Elizabeth Arden, the global cosmetics firm. He had just received his green card, making him a legal resident in the United States. He owned a gleaming new house in Shelton, Conn. His Pakistani-American wife would soon become pregnant with their first child, whom they named Alisheba, or ''beautiful sunshine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four years later, Mr. Shahzad stands accused of planting a car bomb in Times Square on a balmy spring evening. After his arrest two days later, on May 3, while trying to flee to Dubai, the few details that surfaced about his life echoed a familiar narrative about radicalization in the West: his anger toward his adopted country seemed to have grown in lockstep with his personal struggles. He had lost his home to foreclosure last year. At the same time he was showing signs of a profound, religiously infused alienation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the roots of Mr. Shahzad's militancy appear to have sprouted long before, according to interviews with relatives, friends, classmates, neighbors, colleagues and government officials, as well as e-mail messages written by Mr. Shahzad that were obtained by The New York Times. His argument with American foreign policy grew after 9/11, even as he enjoyed America's financial promise and expansive culture. He balanced these dueling emotions with an agility common among his Pakistani immigrant friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Mr. Shahzad became more religious, starting around 2006, he was also turning away from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of his youth, friends recalled, distancing himself from the liberal, elite world of his father, Bahar ul-Haq, a retired vice marshal in the Pakistani Air Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while in recent years Mr. Shahzad struggled to pay his bills, it is unclear that his financial hardship played a significant role in his radicalization. He still owned his home and held a full-time job when he began signaling to friends that he wanted to leave the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In April 2009, the same month Mr. Shahzad got his United States citizenship, he sent an e-mail message to friends that foreshadowed his militant destiny. He criticized the views of a moderate Pakistani politician, writing, ''I bet when it comes to defending the lands, his opinion would be we should do dialogue.'' The politician had ''bought into the Western jargon'' of calling the mujahedeen, or foreign fighters, ''extremist,'' wrote Mr. Shahzad, who urged the recipients of the message to find ''a proper Sheikh to understand the Quran.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the recipients responded by asking Mr. Shahzad which sheikhs he followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Writing in Urdu, Mr. Shahzad replied, ''My sheikhs are in the field.'' A few months later, he abruptly quit his job and left for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where, officials say, he was later trained in bomb-making by the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But precisely what combination of influences -- political, religious and personal -- drove Mr. Shahzad to violence remains a mystery, even to those close to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We all know these things, what the geopolitical problems are,'' said Mr. Shahzad's father-in-law, M. A. Mian, 55. ''Every day we sit in our living rooms with our friends and we discuss these issues.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But to go to this extreme, this is unbelievable,'' he said, adding: ''He has lovely children. Two really lovely children. As a father I would not be able to afford to lose my children.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military Upbringing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Faisal Shahzad grew up somewhat rootless. He identified proudly with his tribal Pashtun heritage, yet knew little of his father's ancestral village, Mohib Banda, a collection of mud huts ringed by sugar and wheat fields in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Shahzad's father, Mr. Haq, had entered the Pakistani Air Force as a common airman before climbing the ranks as a fighter pilot who excelled at midair acrobatics, with posts in England and Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time Mr. Shahzad was 12, his father had been transferred from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to the Pakistani city of Quetta, followed by Rawalpindi. As the son of a senior military officer, Mr. Shahzad was swaddled in privilege, tended to by chauffeurs, servants and armed guards in an insular world made up almost exclusively of military families. Mr. Shahzad's household was a blend of strict and liberal; Mr. Haq, who spoke British-accented English and drank alcohol socially, was stern with his children and quick to anger, friends and former colleagues recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Shahzad entered high school in the mid-1990s, his family had settled in Karachi, a throbbing mega-city in the south. By then, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had plunged into chaos. As political instability and sectarian violence roiled the country, many Pakistanis blamed the United States. After propping up the Pakistani military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, in the 1980s, the American government was now imposing hefty sanctions in retaliation for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear program. The economy stalled as anti-Americanism spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad came of age during </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> state-sponsored jihad against India's military in the breakaway region of Kashmir -- a conflict that granted legendary status to Pakistani jihadists. ''We used to see the mujahedeen as heroes,'' said one graduate of Mr. Shahzad's high school, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. ''When I look back, I think, 'What was I thinking? What were we all doing?' But in that era, it made sense. We all wanted to do something.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear how formative these events were for Mr. Shahzad, who continued to lead a somewhat sheltered existence, living with his family in a neighborhood of stately homes fringed by palm trees and bougainvillea. His school, located on a military base, taught the same rigid curriculum -- with an anti-Western slant and a strict form of Islamic studies -- imposed nationally by General Zia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After graduating, Mr. Shahzad enrolled in Greenwich University, a business school in Karachi known for drawing affluent underachievers with fancy cars. Mr. Shahzad proved a mediocre student. (In high school, he had gotten D's in English composition and microeconomics, according to a transcript.) But what he lacked in academic prowess he made up for in ambition, friends recalled; he was determined to finish his degree in the United States. Taking advantage of a partnership between his college and the University of Bridgeport, in Connecticut, Mr. Shahzad applied for a student visa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Jan. 16, 1999, at the age of 19, Mr. Shahzad left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a new life in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Driven to Success</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The wide, maple-shaded streets leading to the University of Bridgeport seem a long way from Karachi. The quiet, tidy campus overlooks a tranquil stretch of the Long Island Sound, where ferries pass in the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Shahzad started classes there, more than a third of the college's students were foreigners -- 15 of them from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Shahzad stood out. He walked with a confident air, showing off his gym-honed muscles in tight T-shirts. He carried the air of a privileged upbringing, coming off as aloof and, at times, snobbish. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the Pakistani students stuck together, playing cricket and collecting free meals at the campus mosque, Mr. Shahzad had a wider circle of friends and a fuller social calendar. A skilled cook, he drew students to his dorm room with the scent of his simmering lobia, a Pakistani lentil dish. He worked out obsessively and, on weekends, hit New York City's Bengali-theme nightclubs. He loved women, recalled a former classmate, and ''could drink anyone under the table.'' He showed little interest in Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad rarely seemed pressed for cash -- he had a large television in his dorm room and drove a Mitsubishi Galant. But he still looked for work. Nimble with his hands -- he would later take to gardening and painting -- he landed a job designing intricate gold pendants for a jeweler at a mall in Milford. While Mr. Shahzad did not seem to distinguish himself academically, he came across as witty, street smart and ''fast on his feet,'' recalled one classmate. He and his Pakistani peers were chasing the same dream, the classmate said: ''Back then, it was all about fast cars and becoming something.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Shahzad seemed eager to carve out a life in his host country, his anger at America flared early. The classmate recalled walking into Mr. Shahzad's apartment a few days after the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11 to find him staring at news footage of the planes hitting the towers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They had it coming,'' Mr. Shahzad said, according to the friend, a Pakistani-American. The friend said Mr. Shahzad believed that Western countries had conspired to mistreat Muslims. ''He would just go off,'' said the friend, adding that he paid little heed to Mr. Shahzad's eruptions, dismissing them as a product of his fierce Pashtun pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was always saying, 'If these people come to my land, it's not going to be good,' '' the friend recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By late 2001, Mr. Shahzad seemed focused on his American future. Having graduated from the University of Bridgeport with a bachelor's degree in computer applications and information systems, he was working as a clerk for Elizabeth Arden in Stamford. The following year, while holding the same job, Mr. Shahzad began taking night courses at the University of Bridgeport's business school. He had bought a black Mercedes, as well as a $205,000 condominium in Norwalk. Two years later, Mr. Shahzad sold the apartment at a $56,000 profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His broker, Keven Courbois, was struck by Mr. Shahzad's sense of responsibility, given that he was only 25. ''I thought it was great: Look at this guy who is handling a condo on his own,'' Mr. Courbois said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At times, Mr. Shahzad seemed deeply frustrated with his job at Elizabeth Arden, complaining to a friend that the company never raised his $50,000 salary. (The company declined to discuss Mr. Shahzad's employment.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July 2004, three months after selling his condo, Mr. Shahzad bought the gray, two-story house in Shelton, in a quiet, hilly neighborhood of well-tended flower beds and rambling older homes. He was preparing for marriage. His parents agreed on a suitable match: Huma Mian, an ebullient 23-year-old from Denver who had recently graduated with a degree in accounting, and whose Pakistani-American father was a prominent oil industry engineer and economist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Dec. 25, 2004, they held a lavish wedding in Peshawar, Mr. Shahzad's ancestral turf, celebrating with a rare touch of modernity: the women and men danced together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad's ''bachelor days'' were behind him, the former classmate recalled. He was ready to settle down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New Religiosity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two years later, when Mr. Shahzad wrote the e-mail message telling friends that Muslims must defend themselves from ''foreign infidel forces,'' he seemed to be living a stable suburban life. That June, he took a new job as an analyst at the Affinion Group, a financial marketing firm in Norwalk, telling a friend that his annual income had jumped to $70,000. Two months later, he finished his master's degree in business. On weekends, Mr. Shahzad hosted barbecues, mowed his lawn and played badminton in the yard. His wife was pregnant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad had long been critical of American foreign policy. ''He was always very upset about the fabrication of the W.M.D. stunt to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iraq and killing noncombatants such as the sons and grandson of Saddam Hussein,'' said a close relative. In 2003, Mr. Shahzad had been copied on a Google Groups e-mail message bearing photographs of Guantanamo Bay detainees, handcuffed and crouching, below the words ''Shame on you, Bush. Shame on You.'' The following year, Igor Djuric, a real estate agent who helped him buy his house, recalled that Mr. Shahzad was angered by President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If anything struck Mr. Shahzad's friends and family as different, it was his new religiosity. He no longer drank, and was praying five times a day, stopping into mosques in Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport. Some of his friends thought nothing of it; plenty of Pakistani immigrants went through more spiritual phases. What set Mr. Shahzad apart, they said, was not his Islamic devotion, but the particular religious frame through which he had begun to interpret world events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His 2006 e-mail message echoed the same arguments found on militant Internet forums: that the West is at war with Islam, and Muslims are suffering humiliation because they have strayed from their religious duty to fight back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The crusade has already started against Islam and Muslims with cartoons of our beloved Prophet,'' wrote Mr. Shahzad, who went on to quote verses from the Koran as proof of what ''Allah commands about fighting for Islam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During casual conversations with friends, Mr. Shahzad had taken to citing Islamic theology. He was a fan of Ibn Taymiyyah, a 14th-century scholar who inspired a puritanical following, and Abul Ala Mawdudi, a chief architect of the Islamic revival and founder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest Islamic political party, Jamaat-e-Islami. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On visits home, Mr. Shahzad began to clash with his father. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haq had long been wary of political Islam, and found his son's evolution troubling, friends recalled in interviews. The scrutiny went both ways. Mr. Shahzad glared when Mr. Haq once asked him to fetch water to mix with his whiskey, a family friend recalled. ''He wanted to change his father,'' said the classmate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By late 2008, Mr. Shahzad seemed to oscillate between contentment and frustration. He doted on his two small children, even changing diapers to the amazement of his more patriarchal relatives. But he felt demeaned at work, complaining of a manager who used to ''insult him,'' a close relative recalled. He felt that American Muslims were treated differently after 9/11, said the classmate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He used to say that when they refer to us, they say 'Americans of Pakistani origin' -- they don't say 'Americans with German origin,' '' the relative recalled. ''These kinds of things, they were all the time cooking in his head.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2008, Mr. Shahzad gave perhaps the clearest indication yet that he was heading down a militant path. He asked his father for permission to fight in Afghanistan, friends of the father and the relative recalled. Mr. Haq denied the request and appealed to the friends for help in managing his son, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The following year brought a turning point. Back in Connecticut, Mr. Shahzad told his former classmate that he was ready to leave the United States. He was tired of his commute. He found it stressful to keep up mortgage payments on a single income, even though he had urged his wife not to work, said Dr. M. Saud Anwar, a pulmonologist in Connecticut who shares acquaintances with Mr. Shahzad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was like, 'Why am I paying so much for everything -- why am I even here?' '' the classmate recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As time went on, Mr. Shahzad's pride kept him from asking for money from either his family or his wife's, according to a close relative and the classmate. His plan was to wait until he became an American citizen, so he could find lucrative work with an American company in the Middle East and live among Muslims, the classmate recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad got his citizenship on April 17, 2009. That same month, he sent the e-mail message to friends saying that his ''sheikhs are in the field.'' (Dr. Anwar provided portions of the e-mail message, which he obtained from Mr. Shahzad's friend, to The Times and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Return to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the next few months, Mr. Shahzad and his wife held yard sales. The marriage appeared to be strained; Mr. Shahzad was pressuring his wife to wear a hijab, Dr. Anwar said. He also insisted that the family return to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while he searched for a job in the Middle East; his wife wanted him to find the job first, recalled the close relative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 2, Mr. Shahzad called his wife from Kennedy Airport. He said that he was leaving for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and that it was her choice whether she wanted to follow him, the relative recalled. Ms. Mian refused. Later that month, she packed up her children and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where her parents were living. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad stayed with his parents in Peshawar. He appears to have stopped paying his mortgage; the bank foreclosed on his Connecticut home in September. One month later, at a family gathering in Peshawar, Mr. Shahzad seemed angered by the American-led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along the border between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, a close friend said. He was ''condemning the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the government for not doing anything about it,'' the friend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haq was reassured about his son's plans when Mr. Shahzad agreed to start working in the family's farming business. ''He bluffed them,'' said one of the father's friends. In December, he left home, saying he would be back in a couple of days, the relative recalled. He never returned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By then, according to federal investigators, Mr. Shahzad had set himself on a course to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Times Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he returned to the United States on Feb. 3, he circled back to his first days in America. Looking for work, he dropped by to see the jeweler who had hired him in college. He took out a lease on a small apartment just miles from the university campus. His movements over the next few months remain largely a mystery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, his landlord, Stanislaw Chomiak, walked through Mr. Shahzad's apartment, pointing out the spot where he had been building a wooden replica of a mosque. He looked around, as if searching for clues. Mr. Shahzad had been nice, pleasant -- a perfect kind of tenant. He had even lined the burners of the stove with aluminum so they would not get tarnished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Where are you going to find a guy like this?'' the landlord said. ''Nice guy and look what happens.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One fate the conservative commentator Daniel Pipes doesn't have to worry about is drowning in conceptual complexity. He keeps his theories simple. His theory about why Faisal Shahzad tried to blow up a bomb in Times  Square last week is ''jihadi intent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pipes writes dismissively of other explanations - that Shahzad is emotionally unstable, say, or that the bomb was payback for American military action in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In Pipes's universe, apparently, these explanations are rivals to the ''jihadi intent'' explanation, and couldn't figure in an account of how Shahzad came to have jihadi intent in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic seems to agree that jihadism is a kind of prime mover of terrorism. After bloggers noted that Shahzad had lost his home to foreclosure, Goldberg rejected the idea that ''the country's financial crisis, and not, say, jihadist ideology, is at the root of Shahzad's desire to commit murder in Times Square.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'd like to invite Pipes and Goldberg to imagine an alternative universe, a universe in which behaviors - such as planting a bomb - don't have a single ''root'' cause. In this universe, bomb-planting behavior is kind of like the bombs themselves: a number of ingredients have to come together before things get explosive. If you figure out what those ingredients are, and which of them you can control, maybe you can make bomb-planting behavior less common.In the universe I'm positing, the following scenario is conceivable:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani guy moves to America, goes to college, gets a job, starts a family. He grows unhappy. Maybe he's having financial problems (though I'm skeptical, for reasons outlined by Charles Lane here, that Shahzad's home foreclosure actually signifies as much); or maybe the problem is just that he doesn't find his social niche. And maybe he was a bit unstable to begin with - which would make it harder to find his niche and might intensify his reaction to not finding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyway, for whatever reason, he feels alienated in America. He stays in touch with people and events back home in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and this gives him another reason to dislike America: American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are firing missiles into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sometimes killing women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks to the Internet, it doesn't take him long to find like-minded folks, or to come under the influence of a radical imam operating out of Yemen. ''Jihadi intent'' is taking shape, and eventually he comes into the fold of actual jihadis, a faction of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They give him what he hadn't found in America: a sense of belonging, a sense of  purpose. The basic ingredients of bomb-planting behavior are now in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm not sure this is the story of Faisal Shahzad; we don't yet know enough to say. But this story is consistent with the facts disclosed about him so far - and, more to the point, stories like this do unfold in the world we inhabit. Various things fuel ''jihadi intent,'' and they may include the policy of firing missiles into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, this policy does seem to have been part of Shahzad's motivation. He reportedly told investigators he was upset about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obviously (I hope), to say that American policies may cause terrorism isn't to say that America is to blame for terrorism. It's just to say those policies may have downsides. And, obviously, those policies may have upsides as well; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disrupt terrorist logistics, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spelling out my reasons for thinking the downsides often outweigh the upsides is a subject for another column. For now my main point is that war-on-terror hawks need to confront the downsides, rather than act as if establishing the role of ''jihadi intent'' or ''jihadist ideology'' somehow ends the debate. They need to seriously ask whether the policies they favor have, while killing terrorists abroad, created terrorists both abroad and - more disturbingly - at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These possibly counterproductive hawkish policies go beyond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a fact that is unwittingly underscored by the hawks themselves. They're the first to highlight the role played by that imam in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in inspiring Shahzad and other terrorists. But look at the jihadist recruiting narrative al-Awlaki's peddling. He says America is at war with Islam, and to make this case he recites the greatest hits of hawkish policy: the invasion of Iraq, the troop escalation in Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of these policies - not just the last of them - may have helped incite Shahzad. Back in 2004, a real estate agent recalls, he was oddly outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq war. And last year he asked his father for permission to fight Americans in Afghanistan. Only when denied that opportunity did he turn toward Times  Square. (This is evidence against the theory that he was from early on a ''plant'' in America.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So too with the two other high-profile terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against America over the past year: the Fort Hood shooting and the would-be underwear bombing. Both perpetrators had found in hawkish policies cause to buy into the jihadi recruiting narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, was enraged by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the aspiring underwear bomber, before he became an aspiring underwear bomber, was giving glimpses of his inchoate ''jihadi intent'' as a student at University College London. There he sponsored a conference on the war on terror, and on the poster advertising the conference was a picture of a prisoner at Guantanamo - hooded, handcuffed and kneeling. A jihadist pinup, courtesy of Dick Cheney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unfortunately, President Obama isn't discarding the Bush-Cheney playbook that has given jihadist recruiters such effective talking points. Quite the contrary: the White House thinks the moral of the Shahzad story may be that we should get more aggressive in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, possibly putting more boots on the ground. And already Obama has authorized the assassination of al-Awlaki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even leaving aside the constitutional questions (al-Awlaki is an American citizen), doesn't Obama see what a gift the killing of this imam would be to his cause? Just ask the Romans how their anti-Jesus-movement strategy worked out. (And Jesus's followers didn't have their leader's sermons saved in ready-to-go video and audio files; al-Awlaki's resurrection would be vivid indeed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When you look at how much real-world evidence there is against the views of war-on-terror hawks, it's not surprising that they would construct their own little universe, a place where ''jihadi intent'' is an uncaused cause, and our only hope is to kill or intimidate the people who, through some magical process that defies comprehension, have been possessed by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is surprising is that Barack Obama, who became the Democratic nominee for president largely because he had opposed the Iraq war, seems increasingly to be taking his cues from the people who so disastrously supported it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Dennis C. Blair, whose often tumultuous tenure as director of national intelligence was marked by frequent clashes with White House officials and other spy chiefs in America's still fractured intelligence apparatus, announced Thursday that he was resigning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His exit after little more than a year comes as the White House is facing thorny decisions about Iran's nuclear program, the future of Afghanistan and the spread of militancy from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. It also fuels new doubts about the success, and wisdom, of the major intelligence overhaul in 2004 that created the spymaster position. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House did not announce Thursday who would succeed Mr. Blair, but a senior administration official said the likely candidate was James R. Clapper Jr., a retired Air Force lieutenant general and the Pentagon's top intelligence official. Mr. Blair's replacement will be the fourth intelligence director in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The departure of Mr. Blair, a retired admiral, had been rumored for months, but was made official when President Obama called him Thursday and asked him to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Blair's relationship with the White House was rocky since the start of the Obama administration, and he fought a rear-guard action against efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency to cut down the size and power of the national intelligence director's staff. He is the first high-ranking member of the Obama national security team to depart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Blair's departure could strengthen the hand of the C.I.A operatives, who have  bristled at directives from Mr. Blair's office. In recent months, Mr. Blair has been outspoken about reining in the C.I.A.'s covert activities, citing their propensity to backfire and tarnish America's image. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration has largely embraced the C.I.A. operations, especially the agency's campaign to kill militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Born out of the intelligence debacle before the Iraq war, the intelligence director's post was intended to force greater cooperation within a hidebound intelligence bureaucracy, and to ensure that America's spies were better equipped to prevent a repeat of the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet most intelligence experts agree that the job has been  troubled from the start, having little actual power over the operations and budget of a sprawling intelligence infrastructure that the Pentagon and C.I.A. still dominate. The vast majority of America's annual intelligence budget, nearly $50 billion, is spent on spy satellites and high-tech listening devices under Pentagon control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement released Thursday evening, Mr. Blair praised intelligence operatives for working ''tirelessly to provide intelligence support for two wars and to prevent an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on our homeland.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement Thursday, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Blair for ''a remarkable record of service to the United States,'' and said he had ''served with great integrity, intellect, and commitment to our country and the values that we hold dear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said that Mr. Obama called Mr. Blair on Thursday to ask for his resignation, but that the two men had several discussions in person about the subject this week. Their relationship has been characterized as professional but not close, and some administration officials said Mr. Blair often felt cut out of discussions about important security matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions among the White House, the intelligence director and Congressional oversight committees escalated after a young Nigerian man nearly detonated a bomb on a trans-Atlantic flight on Dec. 25. White House officials openly criticized Mr. Blair and his staff for a litany of missed signals that could have prevented the man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, from boarding the plane. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They laid particular blame on the National Counterterrorism Center, one agency that Mr. Blair supervises. A report released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee was particularly critical of the NCTC's failures to piece together the information that could have put Mr. Abdulmutallab on a ''no-fly'' list. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said that Mr. Blair had also angered the White House in recent months by pushing for closer intelligence ties to France, an arrangement opposed by Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some intelligence experts and Republican lawmakers say they believe that the White House has tried to micromanage America's spy agencies, and there was a particularly tense relationship between Mr. Blair and John O. Brennan, the White House counterterrorism director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Blair also fought battles inside the intelligence ranks. Last summer, he clashed with Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, over the appointment of the senior American spies overseas. Mr. Panetta went so far as to issue a memorandum to C.I.A. operatives telling them to disregard a directive that Mr. Blair had sent a day earlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Blair, a Navy officer for decades, considered Mr. Panetta's move an act of insubordination, intelligence officials said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARACHI, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In this violent city of 18 million people, where the country's wealthiest live just miles from thousands of extremist religious schools and their Taliban supporters, lies the urban front line of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struggle with Islamic militancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A thousand miles to the north, the Pakistani Army is fighting the Taliban in barren tribal lands, and the Central Intelligence Agency has unleashed an air war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the infrastructure that propels the insurgency -- recruits, money, hiding places, and ideological underpinning -- is embedded across this grubby city on the Arabian Sea,  according to politicians and militants alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It remains unclear whether Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani-American who is accused of planting a car bomb in Times Square, set out from Karachi for his journey to the tribal area of North Waziristan, where, according to American officials, he got training from the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he lived in a middle-class area of Karachi in the 1990s, and it would have been easy enough for him to find conduits to the Pakistani Taliban among this city's more than 3,500 religious schools, or even to go to the Pakistani Taliban here directly, according to people familiar with his circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani authorities have arrested two men in Karachi who they say were linked to Mr. Shahzad and are now questioning them in Islamabad, Pakistani officials say. One was close to Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical religious party that is staunchly anti-American and whose supporters have harbored operatives of Al Qaeda, a Karachi police official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second man was arrested at a mosque funded by Jaish-i-Muhammad, an Islamic extremist group that has been backed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence agencies, and has recently joined forces with the Pakistani Taliban in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jaish and a multitude of other hard-line Islamic groups have helped make Karachi, with its overlay of radical Islamic edicts -- cinemas barely exist, alcohol is essentially banned -- a welcoming rear base for the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is also a sanctuary for the Afghan Taliban, who the Americans are fighting in Afghanistan and who are clients of the Pakistanis. Despite the arrest of a senior commander for the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, on the outskirts of Karachi in January, some senior members still stay in the wealthy area of the Defense Housing Authority and have free passage in and out of the city, according to local politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chaos and crime that bedevil Karachi, mainly the result of gang warfare among armed wings of the political parties, create a near perfect place for fighters of the Pakistani Taliban to plan and to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amid this violence, the Taliban organize, recruit and raise funds, even as the Pakistani military has opened a series of offensives in the north  that have chased Taliban fighters to other areas, like North Waziristan and Orakzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently the army has launched an offensive in Orakzai, too, and many fighters were retreating to Karachi, a common tactic for the Taliban, according to Jan Mohammed, 21, a fighter from the Pakistani Taliban, who came to Karachi two months ago from Orakzai. ''We have about 500 to 600 fighters here from Orakzai, waiting for orders,'' he said. Some of the wounded Taliban -- those who could make the journey sitting up in a car -- were brought to Karachi for treatment, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another, more senior Taliban fighter in his early 30s, who has lived in Karachi for more than six months, boasted, ''We are well organized here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost all Taliban are from the Pashtun ethnic group whose ancestral homes are in the tribal areas. About five million Pashtun have migrated to Karachi over the years, and while many of the Pashtun in the city do not agree with the Taliban, their presence in the city gives the Taliban cover, the senior fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighters are organized in cells according to the geographical area they came from in the tribal areas, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A veteran Taliban official, known as the emir, serves as the central commander in Karachi, and he receives orders on financial matters and strategy from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban high command, now in North Waziristan, the senior fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This fighter, who said he changed his address every few days in the city, declined to give his name for fear of being discovered by the Karachi authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After an interview, the police stopped the fighter, dressed in Pakistani garb of shirt and baggy trousers, as he hailed a pedicab, he said later. When he showed the police a business card with the name of his trading company, he was allowed to move on, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Taliban fighters are seasonal, and use Karachi as a winter bolt-hole to earn money, often in lowly jobs. They migrate to the tribal areas or move onto Afghanistan in the summer. Last week, a Taliban organizer in South Waziristan said by telephone that he had just received a batch of fighters from Karachi who were heading to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Karachi is important to the Taliban because it is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wall Street. The city's trucking industry, dominated by Pashtun businessmen, carries almost all the supplies the United States Army uses in Afghanistan -- weapons, vehicles, fuel, food and water. Some of the huge amounts of money involved in that transportation splash back to the Taliban, politicians and trucking businessmen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The militants put business first and by default they are benefiting,'' said Ali Mohammed, who runs a company that takes supplies to Afghanistan. ''They are paid very well by the trucking companies'' not to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the convoys, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, the militants ran a parallel trade by truck to supply themselves along many of the same routes, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the trucking companies carried drugs from Kandahar, the Taliban heartland in southern Afghanistan and a center of opium poppy cultivation, to Karachi and returned with weapons for the militants fighting American and NATO forces, Mr. Mohammed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of the rich Pashtun businessmen of Karachi donate to the Taliban, said the senior fighter. ''Money is not a problem for us,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They like to give to get a place in heaven.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Karachi is also an  ideological motor for the insurgency,  powered by a vast circuit of unregistered religious schools, known as madrasas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the militant groups, like Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have sponsored madrasas here for many years, where they imbue a hatred of all things Western and provide the justification for militancy, community leaders said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Sohrab Goth, a bleak sprawl of one-story concrete houses, a madrasa called Jaamia Farooqia is the alma mater for the Pakistani Taliban's chief suicide bomb instructor, Qari Hussain. Many graduates from Jaamia Farooqia have headed to the tribal areas as recruits for the Pakistani Taliban, the senior fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But  pressure on the Taliban from the police, often considered corrupt and violent, is mounting, the senior fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a highly publicized case last October, the police, recently supplemented with more counterterrorism squads, arrested the senior Taliban commander in Karachi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The house of the commander, Akhtar Zaman, was filled with weapons, the police said, and Mr. Zaman remains in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new commander is a younger, less seasoned man from South Waziristan. He has just installed himself at a madrasa in Baldia town, a ramshackle area of narrow alleys and dust-flecked palm trees, dominated by Pashtuns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In keeping with a lower profile, he rebuffed a request for an interview. So far, said the senior fighter, he is  keeping the madrasa free of weapons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that three men who had been detained by the United States military for years without trial in Afghanistan had no recourse to American courts. The decision was a broad victory for the Obama administration in its efforts to hold terrorism suspects overseas for indefinite periods without judicial oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detainees, two Yemenis and a Tunisian who say they were captured outside Afghanistan, contend that they are not terrorists and are being mistakenly imprisoned at the American military prison at Bagram Air Base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously that the three had no right to habeas corpus hearings, in which judges would review evidence against them and could order their release. The court reasoned that Bagram was on the sovereign territory of another government and emphasized the ''pragmatic obstacles'' of giving hearings to detainees ''in an active theater of war.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ruling dealt a severe blow to wider efforts by lawyers to extend a landmark 2008 Supreme Court ruling granting habeas corpus rights to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A lower court judge had previously ruled that the three Bagram detainees were entitled to the same rights, although he had found that others captured in Afghanistan and held there were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lawyer for the detainees, Tina Foster, said that if the precedent stood, Mr. Obama and future presidents would have a free hand to ''kidnap people from other parts of the world and lock them away for the rest of their lives'' without having to prove in court that their suspicions about such prisoners were accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The thing that is most disappointing for those of us who have been in the fight for this long is all of the people who used to be opposed to the idea of unlimited executive power during the Bush administration but now seem to have embraced it during this administration,'' she said. ''We have to remember that Obama is not the last president of the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an influential lawmaker in the long-running debate over detentions, called the ruling a ''big win'' and praised the administration for appealing the lower court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Allowing a noncitizen enemy combatant detained in a combat zone access to American courts would have been a change of historic proportions,'' he said. ''It also would have dealt a severe blow to our war effort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a reason we have never allowed enemy prisoners detained overseas in an active war zone to sue in federal court for their release. It simply makes no sense and would be the ultimate act of turning the war into a crime.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not entirely clear how the ruling might affect detention policies for terrorism suspects caught outside Afghanistan or Iraq. While the Obama administration has stepped up the use of Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill terrorism suspects and has relied on other countries, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to hold and interrogate suspects who are captured alive, it is not known whether the United States has directly captured anyone outside Afghanistan or Iraq recently -- and, if so, where it has taken them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Justice Department spokesman, Dean Boyd, would not comment on the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Rivkin, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Special Forces Association urging the court to side with the government, said the ruling would have broad significance by removing doubts over whether the United States could capture and interrogate terrorism suspects without worrying about having to collect, in dangerous situations, evidence that would later stand up in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is an excellent decision,'' said Mr. Rivkin, who was a White House lawyer in the administration of the first President Bush. ''It has restored a considerable degree of sanity to what threatened to be a crazy legal regime that would have deprived the United States, for the first time in history, of the opportunity to capture and detain -- outside of the United States, in theaters of war -- high-value combatants. That has been solved, and it will apply to many other situations in the future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case was brought on behalf of a Tunisian man who says he was captured in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2002, a Yemeni man who says he was captured in Thailand in 2002, and another Yemeni man who says he was captured in 2003 at another location outside Afghanistan that has not been disclosed. (The government has disputed the second Yemeni's claim.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men's case was originally heard by Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. The Bush and Obama administrations had both urged Judge Bates not to extend habeas corpus rights beyond Guantanamo, arguing that courts should not interfere with military operations inside active combat zones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in April 2009, Judge Bates ruled that there was no difference between the three men who had filed suit and Guantanamo prisoners. His decision was limited to non-Afghans captured outside Afghanistan -- a category that fits only about a dozen of the roughly 800 detainees at Bagram, officials have said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In urging the appeals court to let Judge Bates's decision stand, lawyers for the detainees argued that reversing it would mean that the government would be able ''to evade judicial review of executive detention decisions by transferring detainees into active combat zones, thereby granting the executive the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the appeal panel's decision reversing Judge Bates, Chief Judge David B. Sentelle said there had been no such gamesmanship in the decision to bring the three detainees to Bagram because it happened years before the Supreme Court's Guantanamo rulings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he left the door open to approving habeas corpus rights for prisoners taken to prisons other than Guantanamo in the future, writing, ''We need make no determination on the importance of this possibility, given that it remains only a possibility; its resolution can await a case in which the claim is a reality rather than speculation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Foster vowed to keep fighting. But Mr. Rivkin said that the detainees' chances for overturning the decision were dim because the three appeals judges spanned the ideological spectrum: Chief Judge Sentelle, appointed by President Ronald Reagan; Judge Harry T. Edwards, appointed by President Jimmy Carter; and Judge David S. Tatel, appointed by President Bill Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It could also be difficult to win a reversal by the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices supported giving habeas rights to detainees in the Guantanamo case. Among the narrow majority in that case was Justice John Paul Stevens, who is retiring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The nominee to replace him, Elena Kagan, who as solicitor general signed the government's briefs in the case, would most likely recuse herself from hearing an appeal of the decision, and a four-four split would allow it to stand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- One of the leading figures in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban insurgency was believed killed during a clash with the Afghan police, who said his followers appeared to be trying to establish a new sanctuary in Afghanistan's Nuristan Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The victim was said to be Maulana Fazlullah, leader of the Taliban uprising in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swat Valley, who apparently fled to Afghanistan after a Pakistani counteroffensive wrested the valley from Taliban control last year. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan officials depicted a determined and unusually large-scale effort by the Pakistani insurgents to take over Barg-e-Matal district of Nuristan, a remote, mountainous province United States ground forces recently abandoned as part of a plan to concentrate on more easily defended and heavily populated areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. Zaman Mamozai, head of the Afghan Border Police in eastern Afghanistan, said the fighting, which began Monday but had still not ended late on Thursday, involved a group of 400 to 500 Pakistani Taliban, along with Arab fighters with Al Qaeda and some Afghan insurgents, who launched a series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police and government headquarters in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though impossible to confirm, the presence of such a large contingent of Pakistani Taliban and Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan would underscore the difficulty of ultimately denying havens to the groups, even as the Pakistani military roots them out from parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Mamozai said the authorities believed that Mr. Fazlullah was one of seven Taliban militants killed in the Barg-e-Matal district of Nuristan Province in a continuing battle with the border police, but they were awaiting forensic identification of his remains to be certain. The police recovered the seven bodies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the Nuristan provincial police chief, General Qasim, the militants' bodies were recovered after another counterattack that began late on Wednesday night and ended at dawn, including Pakistanis as well as Chechens and Arabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We could not defeat them ourselves because we had fewer border police,'' said General Qasim, who like many Afghans uses only one name. The defenders consisted of a battalion of 200 officers from the border police and 250 from the national police, he said. General Qasim said that local residents took up arms to support the police because they were enraged by reports that Mr. Fazlullah had called for all fighting-age men in the district to be killed and their women taken prisoner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fazlullah's death had previously been reported last year in Afghanistan, but was later refuted. If confirmed this time, he would be the highest-ranking Pakistani Taliban leader killed since last August. The Pakistanis had offered a bounty of 50 million Pakistani rupees (about $600,000) for his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Serious fighting is still going on so we haven't been able to take their bodies for forensic identification,'' General Mamozai said. He said that the authorities had intercepted Taliban radio communications confirming Mr. Fazlullah's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Mamozai said that Mr. Fazlullah's second in command from Swat, a man known only as Hakimullah, was also reported among the bodies recovered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last August, a missile fired from a C.I.A.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, when it destroyed a house in South Waziristan, also killing his wife and other family members, the authorities said at the time; the Taliban later confirmed the deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His successor as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was also reported killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last January, but a videotaped message from him surfaced months later denying that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fazlullah, believed to be in his 20s, was a former ski lift operator and the son of a radical imam. Nicknamed ''Radio Mullah,'' he is known for his jihadist oratory broadcast over clandestine radio stations, and his image as a brave fighter attracted thousands of recruits to the Taliban cause in Swat. At one time, some 4,500 Taliban militants, taking advantage of a peace agreement with the Pakistani authorities, set up a parallel government in the rugged Swat Valley, imposing harsh Islamic law on the local residents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the Pakistani Army launched its offensive against the Taliban in Swat last spring, Mr. Fazlullah escaped, along with most of the rest of the Taliban leadership. The Pakistani authorities believe Mr. Fazlullah first went to Bajaur in the tribal area bordering Afghanistan, and then escaped to Kunar, just south of Nuristan Province. There, the Pakistanis believe he was given cover by the Afghan provincial authorities, a Pakistani military official said Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fazlullah's death would probably hinder the re-emergence of the Taliban in Swat, where he had particular local appeal. He was associated with the umbrella organization of the Pakistani Taliban that is fighting the army in other tribal areas, but his influence was largely limited to Swat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan are separate organizations but have close ties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere in eastern Afghanistan, a would-be suicide bomber apparently on his way to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an Afghan Army base in the Behsud District of Nangarhar Province was involved in a car accident that disabled his vehicle, according to Colonel Ghafoor, a spokesman for the provincial police headquarters who goes by one name. The bomber fled before the police arrived and found the car wired to explode. NATO troops safely defused the bomb, Colonel Ghafoor said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama's first formal national security strategy describes a coming era in which the United States will have to learn to live within its limits -- a world in which two wars cannot be sustained for much longer and  the rising powers inevitably begin to erode some elements of American influence around the globe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama argues that the United States is confident enough to live with that reality and that after nearly a decade of organizing its national security policy around counterterrorism, it must return to a broader agenda. ''The burdens of a young century cannot fall on American shoulders alone,'' Mr. Obama says in the introduction of the strategy released on Thursday. ''Indeed, our adversaries would like to see America sap our strength by overextending our power.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this document, required by Congress, is also bound to reignite the argument over the way Mr. Obama has redirected American foreign policy over the past 16 months. His critics -- inclined to portray him as too eager to apologize for America's failings and too willing to surrender the nation's role as the single, indispensable superpower -- are likely to extract elements of the new document to bolster their case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But to Mr. Obama's  team, it is a document that recognizes the world as it is and ends a era of illusion in which Washington confused projecting power with achieving results. ''We are no less powerful,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday at the Brookings Institution. ''We are shifting from mostly direct application and exercise of American power,'' she said, to one of indirection, that requires patience and partners, and gets results more slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In a world like this, American leadership isn't needed less,'' she said. ''It is needed more. And the simple fact is that no global problem can be solved without us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 52-page document tries to blend the idealism of Mr. Obama's campaign promises with the realities of his confrontations with a fractious and threatening world.  It describes an America ''hardened by war'' and ''disciplined by a devastating economic crisis,'' and it concludes that the United States cannot sustain extended wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan while fulfilling other commitments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That line is just one of many subtle slaps at former President George W. Bush. While Mr. Bush's 2002 document explicitly said the United States would never allow the rise of a rival superpower, Mr. Obama argues that America faces no real military competitor but that global power is increasingly diffuse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Mrs. Clinton and the principal author of the report, Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, argued that Mr. Obama recognized that reality when he pressed the Group of 8 nations -- the largest industrialized economies and Russia -- to cede more power to the Group of 20, which includes fast-emerging powers like China, India and Brazil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Obama has put a renewed focus on the Afghan war and increased C.I.A.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the strategy rejects Mr. Bush's focus on counterterrorism as the organizing principle of  security policy. Those efforts ''to counter violent extremism'' -- Mr. Obama avoids the word Islamic -- ''are only one element of our strategic environment and cannot define America's engagement with the world.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He goes on to argue that ''the gravest danger to the American people and global security continues to come from weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons.'' But he also dwells on cyberthreats, climate change and America's dependence on fossil fuels as fundamental national security issues, issues that received little or no attention in Mr. Bush's document, although Mr. Bush focused on them more in his second term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is a rather dramatic departure from the most recent prior national security strategy,'' said Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The differences are clearest in a section on the use of force, which makes no mention of pre-emptive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against countries or nonstate actors who may pose a threat, as Mr. Bush did in 2002. But Mr. Obama does not explicitly rule out striking first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While the use of force is sometimes necessary, we will exhaust other options before war whenever we can, and carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs and risks of inaction,'' he says. When it is necessary, he adds, ''we will seek broad international support.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush's aides had said they would not seek a ''permission slip'' for such actions. Mr. Obama phrases that idea  more softly, saying ''the United States must reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend our nation and our interests, yet we will also seek to adhere to standards that govern the use of force.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama also defines security more broadly than his predecessor did, making the case, for example, that reducing the budget deficit is critical to sustaining American power. Mrs. Clinton focused much of her Brookings presentation on that theme, arguing that American commanders and diplomats see the long-term national debt as one of the largest threats to American influence and to the country's ability to project power abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, for all its self-conscious rejection of the Bush era, the document reflects elements of continuity. For example, it does not disavow using the state secrets act to withhold information from courts in terrorism cases, although it argues for prudent and limited use. It also insists that ''we will maintain the military superiority that has secured our country, and underpinned global security, for decades.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It does not make the spread of democracy the priority that Mr. Bush did, but it embraces the goal more robustly than is typical for Mr. Obama, a reflection of a struggle in his administration about how to handle a topic  so associated with Mr. Bush. Mr. Obama commits to ''welcoming all peaceful democratic movements'' and to ''supporting the development of institutions within fragile democracies.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A senior United Nations official is expected to call on the United States next week to stop Central Intelligence Agencydrone </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against people suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda, complicating the Obama administration's growing reliance on that tactic in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said Thursday that he would deliver a report on June 3 to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva declaring that the ''life and death power'' of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be entrusted to regular armed forces, not intelligence agencies. He contrasted how the military and the C.I.A. responded to allegations that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had killed civilians by mistake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''With the Defense Department you've got maybe not perfect but quite abundant accountability as demonstrated by what happens when a bombing goes wrong in Afghanistan,'' he said in an interview. ''The whole process that follows is very open. Whereas if the C.I.A. is doing it, by definition they are not going to answer questions, not provide any information, and not do any follow-up that we know about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Alston's views are not legally binding, and his report will not assert that the operation of combat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by nonmilitary personnel is a war crime, he said. But the mounting international concern over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes as the Obama administration legal team has been quietly struggling over how to justify such counterterrorism efforts while obeying the laws of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, top lawyers for the State Department and the Defense Department have tried to square the idea that the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program is lawful with the United States' efforts to prosecute Guantanamo Bay detainees accused of killing American soldiers in combat, according to interviews and a review of military documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the laws of war, soldiers in traditional armies cannot be prosecuted and punished for killing enemy forces in battle. The United States has argued that because Qaeda fighters do not obey the requirements laid out in the Geneva Conventions -- like wearing uniforms -- they are not ''privileged combatants'' entitled to such battlefield immunity. But C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators also wear no uniforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paula Weiss, a C.I.A. spokeswoman, called into question the notion that the agency lacked accountability, noting that it was overseen by the White House and Congress. ''While we don't discuss or confirm specific activities, this agency's operations take place in a framework of both law and government oversight,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''It would be wrong to suggest the C.I.A. is not accountable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the Obama administration legal team confronted the issue as the Pentagon prepared to restart military commission trials at Guantanamo Bay. The commissions began with pretrial hearings in the case of Omar Khadr, a Canadian detainee accused of killing an Army sergeant during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002, when Mr. Khadr was 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon delayed issuing a 281-page manual laying out commission rules until the eve of the hearing. The reason, officials say, is that government lawyers had been scrambling to rewrite a section about murder because it has implications for the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An earlier version of the manual, issued in 2007 by the Bush administration, defined the charge of ''murder in violation of the laws of war'' as a killing by someone who did not meet ''the requirements for lawful combatancy'' -- like being part of a regular army or otherwise wearing a uniform. Similar language was incorporated into a draft of the new manual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the Khadr hearing approached, Harold Koh, the State Department legal adviser, pointed out that such a definition could be construed as a concession by the United States that C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators were war criminals. Jeh Johnson, the Defense Department general counsel, and his staff ultimately agreed with that concern. They redrafted the manual so that murder by an unprivileged combatant would instead be treated like espionage -- an offense under domestic law  not considered a war crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''An accused may be convicted,'' the final manual states, if he ''engaged in conduct traditionally triable by military commission (e.g., spying; murder committed while the accused did not meet the requirements of privileged belligerency) even if such conduct does not violate the international law of war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under that reformulation, the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators -- who reportedly fly the aircraft from agency headquarters in Langley, Va. -- might theoretically be subject to prosecution in a Pakistani courtroom. But regardless, the United States can argue to allies that it is not violating the laws of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Alston, the United Nations official, said he agreed with the Obama legal team that ''it is not per se illegal'' under the laws of war for C.I.A. operatives to fire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missiles ''because anyone can stand up and start to act as a belligerent.'' Still, he emphasized, they would not be entitled to battlefield immunity like soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mary Ellen O'Connell, a University of Notre Dame law professor who has criticized the use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> away from combat zones, also agreed with the Obama administration's legal theory in this case. She said it could provide a ''small modicum'' of protection for C.I.A. operatives, noting that Germany had a statute allowing it to prosecute violations of the Geneva Conventions, but it does not enforce domestic Pakistani laws against murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, Mr. Koh delivered a speech in which he argued that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program was lawful because of the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and the principle of self-defense. He did not address several other murky legal issues, like whether Pakistani officials had secretly consented to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Alston, who is a New York University law professor, said his report would analyze such questions in detail, which may increase pressure on the United States to discuss them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American military on Saturday released a scathing report on the deaths of 23 Afghan civilians, saying that ''inaccurate and unprofessional'' reporting by Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators helped lead to an airstrike in February on a group of innocent men, women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report said that four American officers, including a brigade and battalion commander, had been reprimanded, and that two junior officers had also been disciplined. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who apologized to President Hamid Karzai after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced a series of training measures intended to reduce the chances of similar events.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which three vehicles were destroyed, illustrated the extraordinary sensitivity to the inadvertent killing of noncombatants by NATO forces. Since taking command here last June, General McChrystal has made protection of civilians a high priority, and has sharply restricted airstrikes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The overwhelming majority of civilian deaths in Afghanistan are caused by insurgents, but the growing intensity of the fighting this year has sent civilian casualties to their highest levels since 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal's concern is that NATO forces, in their ninth year of operations in Afghanistan, are rapidly wearing out their welcome. Opinion polls here appear to reflect that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When we make a mistake, we must be forthright,'' General McChrystal said in a statement. ''And we must do everything in our power to correct that mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The civilian deaths highlighted the hazards in relying on remotely piloted aircraft to track people suspected of being insurgents. In this case, as in many others where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are employed by the military, the people steering and spotting the targets sat at a console in Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred on the morning of Feb. 21, near the village of Shahidi Hassas in Oruzgan Province, a Taliban-dominated area in southern Afghanistan. An American Special Operations team was tracking a group of insurgents when a pickup truck and two sport utility vehicles  began heading their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Predator operators reported seeing only military-age men in the truck, the report said. The ground commander concurred, the report said, and the Special Operations team asked for an airstrike. An OH-58D Kiowa helicopter fired Hellfire missiles and rockets, destroying the vehicles and killing 23 civilians. Twelve others were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report, signed by Maj. Gen. Timothy P. McHale, found that the Predator operators in Nevada and ''poorly functioning command posts'' in the area failed to provide the ground commander with evidence that there were civilians in the trucks. Because of that, General McHale wrote, the commander wrongly believed that the vehicles, then seven miles away, contained insurgents who were moving to reinforce the fighters he and his men were tracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred because the ground force commander lacked a clear understanding of who was in the vehicles, the location, direction of travel, and the likely course of action of the vehicles,'' General McHale wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ''tragic loss of life,'' General McHale found, was compounded by the failure of the ground commander and others to report in a timely manner that they might have killed civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and similar aircraft carry powerful cameras that beam real-time images to their operators, and some are armed with missiles, as well. The C.I.A. operates its own </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operation, mostly focused on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and separate from the military's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this case, the military Predator operators in Nevada tracked the convoy for three and a half hours, but failed to notice any of the women who were riding along, the report said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to military officials in Washington and Afghanistan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters on the case, intelligence analysts who were monitoring the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> video feed sent computer messages twice, warning the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators and ground command posts that children were visible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators reported that the convoy contained only military-age men. ''Information that the convoy was anything other than an attacking force was ignored or downplayed by the Predator crew,'' General McHale wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immediately after the initial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Kiowa helicopter's crew spotted brightly colored clothing at the scene, and, suspecting that civilians might have been in the trucks, stopped firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Special Operations team turned over the bodies to local Afghans. Even so, General McHale said, officers on the ground failed to report the possibility of civilian casualties in a timely way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On receiving the results of the investigation, General McChrystal recommended a battery of additional training exercises for military personnel coming to Afghanistan, and additional training for those already here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to reprimanding the four officers and admonishing the other two, General McChrystal asked Air Force commanders to open an investigation into the Predator operators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The operational leader for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan was killed in an American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas in the last two weeks, according to a statement the group issued late Monday that American officials believe is correct.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militant leader, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, an Egyptian, was a top financial chief for Al Qaeda as well as one of the group's founders, and was considered by American intelligence officials to be the organization's No. 3 leader, behind Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, another Egyptian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His death will only be a severe curse by his life upon the infidels,'' Al Qaeda said in a statement issued to jihadist Web sites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors statements by jihadists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A United States official said  American intelligence analysts believed the statement from Al Qaeda was accurate. They said the death of Mr. Yazid, also known as Saeed al-Masri, was a significant setback to Al Qaeda's ability to help plan and support cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and allied forces in Afghanistan from its haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In terms of counterterrorism, this would be a big victory,'' said the American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Al-Masri was the group's chief operating officer, with a hand in everything from finances to operational planning. He was also the organization's prime conduit to bin Laden and Zawahri.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His death would be a major blow to Al Qaeda, which in December lost both its internal and external operations chiefs,'' the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Yazid, 54,  appeared in numerous video releases from as-Sahab, the media arm of Al Qaeda, since his first appearance on May 26, 2007, when he was formally introduced to the jihadist online community, according to SITE. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after the suicide bombing against the C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, in December, in which seven C.I.A. operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed, Mr. Yazid issued a statement praising the work of the  bomber, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, and said that the bombing was revenge for the killings of a number of top militant leaders in C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under President Obama, the C.I.A. has steadily increased the number of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against targets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas by remotely piloted Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. As of May 28, the C.I.A. had carried out 38 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year, compared with 53 for all of 2009, according to The Long War Journal, a Web site that tracks the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. has previously killed many of Mr. Yazid's predecessors in Al Qaeda's No. 3 slot. Mr. Yazid was reported to have been killed by an airstrike in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before, in August 2008, only to reemerge and resume his operations. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A senior United Nations official said on Wednesday that the growing use of armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the United States to kill terrorism suspects was undermining global constraints on the use of military force. He warned that the American example would lead to a chaotic world as the new weapons technology inevitably spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a 29-page report  to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the official, Philip Alston, the United Nations special representative on extrajudicial executions, called on the United States to exercise greater restraint in its use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in places like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Yemen, outside the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report -- the most extensive effort by the United Nations to grapple with the legal implications of armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- also proposed a summit meeting of ''key military powers'' to clarify legal limits on such killings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, Mr. Alston said the United States appeared to think that it was ''facing a unique threat from transnational terrorist networks'' that justified its effort to put forward legal justifications that would make the rules ''as flexible as possible.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that example, he said, could quickly lead to a situation in which dozens of countries carry out ''competing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outside their borders against people ''labeled as terrorists by one group or another.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm particularly concerned that the United States seems oblivious to this fact when it asserts an ever-expanding entitlement for itself to target individuals across the globe,'' Mr. Alston said in an accompanying statement. ''But this strongly asserted but ill-defined license to kill without accountability is not an entitlement which the United States or other states can have without doing grave damage to the rules designed to protect the right to life and prevent extrajudicial executions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Alston is scheduled to present his findings to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday. While not legally binding, his report escalates the volume of international concerns over a tactic that has become the Obama administration's weapon of choice against Al Qaeda and its allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Alston's report would call on the United States to stop using Central Intelligence Agency-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and limit the technology to regular military forces because they are open and publicly accountable for their conduct -- for example, by investigating missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that kill civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Days later, news emerged that a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas was believed to have killed Al Qaeda's third-ranking leader, apparently a major success. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Alston acknowledged that the United States could make ''a reasonable legal argument'' that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against such a figure in those circumstances was lawful and appropriate, but he argued that the escalating number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still raised concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''is a very convenient one because there you have got a very clearly acceptable target, but we're not told who the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are against and what efforts are being made to comply with the rules,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report calls on nations like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to publicly disclose the scope and limits of any permission granted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on their territories. It also calls on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators like the United States to disclose the legal justification for such killings, the criteria and safeguards used when selecting targets, and the process for investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that kill civilians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A White House spokesman declined to comment on the report, but pointed to a speech in March by the State Department legal adviser, Harold Koh, that partly outlined the Obama administration's legal rationale. Mr. Koh said the United States obeyed legal limits on the use of force when selecting targets, and he defended </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killings as lawful because of the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and because of the nation's right to self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A state that is engaged in an armed conflict or in legitimate self-defense is not required to provide targets with legal process before the state may use lethal force,'' he said. ''Our procedures and practices for identifying lawful targets are extremely robust, and advanced technologies have helped to make our targeting even more precise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United Nations report agrees that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killings can be lawful in battlefield combat. But it says that the United States is stretching the limits of who can be lawful targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, it criticized the United States for singling out drug lords in Afghanistan suspected of giving money to the Taliban, a policy it said was contrary to the traditional understanding of the laws of war. Similarly, it said, terrorism financiers, propagandists and others who are not fighters should face criminal prosecution, not summary killing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also said that a targeted killing outside of an armed conflict ''is almost never likely to be legal.'' In particular, it rejected ''pre-emptive self-defense'' as a justification for killing terrorism suspects far from combat zones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This expansive and open-ended interpretation of the right to self-defense goes a long way towards destroying the prohibition on the use of armed force contained in the U.N. Charter,'' Mr. Alston said. ''If invoked by other states, in pursuit of those they deem to be terrorists and to have attacked them, it would cause chaos.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a United States official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been an ''effective, exact and essential'' tactic for reaching militants in inaccessible areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose government does not want the United States military fighting in its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The United States has an inherent right to protect itself and will not refrain from doing so based on someone else's exceptionally narrow -- if not faulty -- definition of self-defense,'' the official said. The report noted that Russia and Israel had also claimed a right in recent years to single out people they deemed terrorism suspects, and Mr. Alston said 40 other countries already had </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology -- with several already seeking armed versions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Warning that the technology is making targeted killings much easier and more frequent, the report urged major military nations to meet with human rights specialists to work out agreements on murky legal issues, such as when a farmer who sets roadside bombs at night may be a target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report also raised concerns that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators might not have the same respect for the laws of war as soldiers in the field who have ''been subjected to the risks and rigors of battle.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because operators are based thousands of miles away from the battlefield, and undertake operations entirely through computer screens and remote audio-feed, there is a risk of developing a 'PlayStation'  mentality to killing,'' it said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, the military released a report faulting military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators for ''inaccurate and unprofessional'' reporting that led to an airstrike in February that killed 23 Afghan civilians, including women and children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama has picked Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr. as director of national intelligence, tapping a retired officer with decades of experience to improve coordination of the nation's sprawling spy apparatus amid increasing threats at home and escalating operations abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama plans to announce his choice in the Rose Garden on Saturday, two weeks after forcing Adm. Dennis C. Blair out of the spymaster job, according to administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to disclose the decision before the formal ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The selection amounts to pushing the reset button for the president as he tries to recalibrate an intelligence structure that has undergone continued revamping since the debacle leading up to the Iraq war, yet by most accounts still lacks the cohesion necessary in an evolving war with terrorists. Even as intelligence agencies expand their role overseas with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and increased focus on Yemen and Somalia, they have faced a spate of attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Clapper, 69, who retired in 1995 after 32 years in the Air Force, rose from a signals intelligence officer to undersecretary of defense for intelligence, overseeing all military spy operations. In picking him, the president found an intelligence veteran who clashed with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and was pushed out of office as a result, only to return to the Pentagon as a top lieutenant to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If confirmed by the Senate, General Clapper will be the fourth official since 2005 to oversee the nation's 16 intelligence agencies, a job created in the aftermath of the Iraq intelligence failures. Some intelligence officials have portrayed the job as a bureaucratic nightmare. Essentially, it involves coordinating some very powerful intelligence chiefs, including the C.I.A. director, who have bigger budgets, their own power bases and access to administration officials and members of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Obama concluded that General Clapper's experience would enable him to fix a dysfunctional situation. ''He has a mandate to work it better and that will require some changes,'' said a senior administration official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He knows the inside of the business better than anybody I know,'' said John J. Hamre, a former deputy defense secretary and now president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But General Clapper will have to figure out how to refashion the job created by Congress to be more effective. ''You can't administratively fix birth defects in legislation,'' Mr. Hamre said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Clapper may face a fight to get confirmed. The choice generated consternation in the Senate, where some Democrats and Republicans complained that he is too closely aligned to the military, has resisted strengthening the office he has been selected for, and has not cultivated close ties on Capitol Hill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has served honorably and with distinction for a long time, but he's focused too much on Defense Department issues,'' Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, said in a telephone interview on Friday. ''And I don't believe that he's been forthcoming and open with the Intelligence Committee.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democratic chairwoman of the intelligence committee, was traveling on Friday and unavailable for comment, her office said. But Ms. Feinstein also expressed reservations when General Clapper emerged as an early front-runner to succeed Mr. Blair last month, saying it would be better to appoint a civilian to the job.  However, several leading candidates --  including Mr. Hamre; Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director; and former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska  -- all made clear they were not interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other senators said that General Clapper lacked a forceful enough personality and management style to assert control over the sprawling American intelligence apparatus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are problems within the intelligence community that must be addressed in a very strong and direct way,'' Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican on the committee, said through a spokeswoman. ''I have real reservations about General Clapper being that person.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But General Clapper has an independent streak and has not been afraid to challenge bosses in the past. When Congress was debating the creation of the director of national intelligence job, General Clapper was director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the little-known part of the nation's spy infrastructure that analyzes maps and secret satellite imagery. He told Congress that he would support transferring his agency from the Pentagon to the control of the new intelligence director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That position contradicted the views of Mr. Rumsfeld, who eventually forced out General Clapper in 2006. But Mr. Rumsfeld was pushed out by President George W. Bush later that year and was replaced by Mr. Gates, who rehired the retired general for the Pentagon's top intelligence job in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2008, General Clapper oversaw the dismantling of a controversial military intelligence office that lawmakers and civil liberties groups said was part of a Pentagon effort to expand into domestic spying. Mr. Rumsfeld created the unit, called the Counterintelligence Field Activity Office, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to counter the operations of foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups in the United States and abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the secretive office came under sharp criticism in 2005 after it was revealed that it was managing a database that included information about antiwar protests planned at churches, schools and Quaker meeting halls. General Clapper ordered an end to the database, called Talon, and most of the office's operations were merged into the military's Defense Intelligence Agency, which General Clapper led from 1991 to 1995. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The director of national intelligence is supposed to oversee the nation's separate spy agencies and serve as the president's primary adviser on matters of intelligence. But in practice, the director's authority has been murky, particularly since the vast majority of America's annual intelligence budget of nearly $50 billion is out of his direct control because it goes to spy satellites and high-tech listening devices operated by the Pentagon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has also been unclear how much control the director has over the C.I.A., which has grown in power as it has taken on an expanded role in secret wars in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yemen and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, General Clapper's predecessor was seen as being on the losing end of internal battles with Mr. Panetta.   over who would appoint station chiefs around the world. Mr. Blair had little chemistry with Mr. Obama, officials said, and the president criticized the coordination of intelligence sharing after the botched effort to blow up a Northwest Airlines passenger jet last Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president decided to make a change and sat down with General Clapper in the Oval Office on May 5, when he asked the retired general for his views of the future of intelligence operations and the director's job specifically, according to an administration official briefed on the session. General Clapper followed up with a letter about his vision that impressed the president, the official said. Mr. Blair resigned under pressure on May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those who know him say that General Clapper is expected to work smoothly with Mr. Panetta and John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's counterterrorism chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Jim is a true intelligence professional,'' said Gen. Michael V. Hayden, a former C.I.A. director.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama urged the Senate to quickly confirm his new pick for director of national intelligence, Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., asking that the retired Air Force general's nomination not become hostage to Washington politics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has a quality I prize among all my advisers -- an ability to tell me what we need to know, as opposed to just what we want to hear,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday, standing next to General Clapper in the Rose Garden to announce his selection. ''Mr. Obama said General Clapper, a 69-year-old Vietnam veteran who rose from the position of signal intelligence officer to under secretary of defense for intelligence, ''understands the importance of working with our partners in Congress.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Clapper has a long history in Washington; he clashed with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and was pushed out of office as a result, only to return to the Pentagon as a top lieutenant to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The announcement of General Clapper as the next director of national intelligence came just two weeks after Mr. Obama forced Adm. Dennis C. Blair out of the spymaster job. The selection is an attempt by the president to try to recalibrate an intelligence structure that has undergone continued revamping since the intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq war, yet by most accounts still lacks the cohesion necessary to deal with evolving terrorist threats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as intelligence agencies expand their role overseas with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an increased focus on Yemen and Somalia, they have been confronted by renewed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If confirmed by the Senate, General Clapper will be the fourth official since 2005 to oversee the nation's 16 intelligence agencies -- a job that many intelligence officials have said is a bureaucratic nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama may have to expend some of his political capital to get General Clapper confirmed. In the Senate, representatives of both the Democratic and Republican Parties complain that General Clapper is too close to the military. But several leading civilian candidates for the job, including Leon E. Panetta, the Central Intelligence Agency director, and former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska made clear that they were not interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Clapper followed Mr. Obama to the lectern to deliver remarks  -- and they were short in the extreme. After calling himself ''humbled, honored and daunted'' by the magnitude of the position and promising to make sure that America's intelligence apparatus works, he joked that the national intelligence position and intelligence in general were ''like my grandchildren'': ''Better seen than heard.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lahore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FOR many Pakistanis, the deaths of more than 80 members of the Ahmadi religious sect in mosque </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two weeks ago raised questions of the nation's future. For me, it recalled a command from my schoolboy past: ''Write a Note on the Two-Nation Theory.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a way of scoring easy points on the history exam, and of using new emotions and impressive-sounding words. I began my answer like this: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Two-Nation Theory is the Theory that holds that the Hindus and Muslims of the Indian Subcontinent are Two Distinct and Separate Nations. It is a Theory that is supported by Numerous Facts and Figures. During the War of Independence of 1857 the Muslim rulers of India were defeated by the British. Suddenly the Hindus, who had always held a grudge against the Muslims for conquering them, began to collaborate with the new British rulers. They joined British schools, worked in British offices and began to make large amounts of money, while the Muslims, who were Discriminated Against, became poorer and poorer. It was now Undisputable that the Hindus and the Muslims were Two Distinct and Separate Nations, and it was becoming necessary for the Muslims to demand a Distinct and Separate Homeland for themselves in the Indian Subcontinent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To that point, my ''note'' had only built up the atmosphere of mistrust and hostility between Hindus and Muslims. It had yet to give examples of the Distinctness and Separateness of the two communities (such as that Hindus worshipped the cow but Muslims ate it), of Hindu betrayals and conspiracies (they wanted Hindi, not Urdu, to be the national language). And it had still to name and praise the saddened Muslim clerics, reformers and poets who had first noted these ''undisputable'' differences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I got points for every mini-note that I stretched into a full page, which was valid if it gave one important date and one important name, each highlighted for the benefit of the teacher. This was because the teacher couldn't really read English, and could award points only to answers that carefully showcased their Facts and Figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the exam I would go home. Here the Two-Nation Theory fell apart. I was part-Shiite (my mother's family), part-Sunni (my father's family) and part-nothing (neither of my parents was sectarian). There were other things: the dark-skinned man who swabbed the floors of the house was a Christian; the jovial, foul-mouthed, red-haired old woman who visited my grandmother every few months was rumored to be an Ahmadi. (It was a small group, I had been told, that considered itself Muslim but had been outlawed by the government.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even more than these visible religious variations, I was more aware of things like caste and money: my mother's family was upper caste, claiming a magical blood bond with the Prophet Muhammad, and owned large tracts of land in the countryside. My father's relatives, however, were undisguised converts from Hinduism who had fled their villages long ago and now lived in the city, where they were always running out of money, working in government offices and selling homemade furniture and gambling (and losing) on the stock market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Two-Nation Theory allowed only for the simple categories of Hindu and Muslim, one for India and the other for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; it had no room for inner complications like Shiite and Sunni and Christian and Ahmadi. (I had yet to learn that more than a million Hindus still lived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) It also required the abolition of magical blood claims and landholdings and stock markets, so that our personalities and situations could be determined purely by our religious beliefs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But I knew that things weren't really like that. And this was something I knew from the beginning, and lived with quite comfortably: the history in my textbook was Distinct and Separate from the histories of real people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some years later, in a secluded college library in Massachusetts, I read a very different account of the Two-Nation Theory. Here I learned that it was devised in the 1930s  by a group of desperate Muslim politicians who wanted to extract some constitutional concessions from the British before they left India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Muslims of India, these politicians were saying in their political way, were a ''distinct group'' with their own ''history and culture.'' But really, the book told me, all they wanted was special protection for the poor Muslim minorities in soon-to-be-independent, mostly Hindu India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But the politicians' gamble failed; they were taken up on their bluff  and were given a separate country, abruptly and violently cut-up, two far-apart chunks of Muslim-majority areas (but what about the poor Muslim minorities that were still stuck in Hindu-majority areas!) that its founders (but it was a mistake!) now had to justify with the subtleties of their theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was like a punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One by one, the founders died -- the most important, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, just a year after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> birth. Their theory could have died with them. What was the use now of the idea of Muslim specialness -- the distinctiveness and separateness of Indian Muslims -- in an independent, Muslim-majority country? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the idea was kept alive and made useful: first by a set of unelected bureaucrats, then by generals, then by landowners, and then by generals again. And, always, to blackmail the people (still indistinct and unspecial). An Islamic dance was danced: sovereignty rested with ''Allah alone''; the country would be called an Islamic republic; alcohol and gambling were banned; the Ahmadi sect was outlawed (to please the fringe mullahs) for violating, with their beliefs and practices, Muhammad's position in ''the principle of the finality of [Muhammad's] prophethood.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It peaked with the government takeover in 1977 by Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, who announced that his great wish in life was to ''Islamize'' the people of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Two-Nation Theory, confined so far to political slogans and clauses in the Constitution, now went everywhere: it was injected into textbook passages (the ones I would reproduce, with new words and emotions, in my exam) and radio shows and programs on the one state-run TV channel. And it branched out, becoming anti-Communist (to attract American money), anti-Shiite (to attract Arab money, given for cutting Iran's influence in the continent), anti-woman (to please the mullahs) and still more anti-Ahmadi (to enhance the pleasure and power of the mullahs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Two-Nation Theory was dynamic, useful, lucrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it still is lucrative. Its best rewards are nowadays found in the high ratings (and correspondingly high advertising revenue) of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> newly independent TV channels. Dozens of them are competing to sell the fastest-burning conspiracy theories (India and Israel and America are behind the latest suicide bombings) and the most punishing religious advice (don't wear nail polish, don't celebrate birthdays, kill blasphemers wherever you find them), that a semi-urban, semi-Islamized population, raised on years of government textbooks and radio shows and TV sermons (themselves confirmed and elucidated by the  sermons of mullahs in neighborhood mosques) finds hard to shut out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the coordinated gun and bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during services at two Ahmadi mosques here on May 28 surprised no one. Some were saddened. But most took it as a matter of course. On the TV channels news of the assaults was reported and displayed (all those eyeballs, all those ads) but not explained. And in Lahore's Main Market, near rickshaw stands and fruit stalls -- the rickshaw drivers and fruit sellers standing in the heat outside the window display of an electronics shop, watching the muted carnage on an imported flat-screen TV -- the incident was mulled over and attributed in the end to the larger madness that was overtaking the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IT was, they agreed, in some ways like the burning last year of a Christian village outside Lahore, and in other ways like the sporadic killings of Shiites in the years before that. But they also likened it to the televised killings of armed clerics in Islamabad's Red Mosque -- carried out three years ago by the military itself -- and the unadmitted, unexplained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still falling on the people in the western mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the drawing rooms of Lahore, among the children of bureaucrats, landlords and military men (amazingly practical and un-Islamic in their drawing rooms), it was said that the Ahmadi </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though tragic, were not a sign of doom. After all, the Punjabi Taliban, who had claimed responsibility, were just another network -- easily disrupted (when the time came) by a combination of on-the-ground raids and abductions, long and unexplained detentions, and perhaps </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on mountainside training centers by the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that we don't admit to knowing anything about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was their idea of the war on terrorism: the physical removal of a nuisance, something rare and extreme and isolatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few days later, I read in the newspaper that the police had made an arrest in the Ahmadi </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suspect's name was Abdullah and he was 17 years old. When asked for his motives, he said that he had learned that Ahmadis were drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, ''so their bloodshed was a great service to Islam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a simple enough statement. But I wondered about his ideas. Had he taken them from the Constitution? Or was he inspired by the court order days earlier banning Facebook for holding a contest of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Did he hear it in a mosque, or see it on a TV screen in the window display of an electronics shop? Did he read about blasphemy and its punishments in a textbook? Or was he one of those boys (Twenty million? Thirty million?) who don't go to school and can't read textbooks? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Was he taught about the Ahmadis in the mountains of Waziristan, where the police say he trained for his mission? Did he witness an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there? Did he think it was carried out by Ahmadis? Was it confirmed for him by a popular talk show host that the Ahmadis were America's agents in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? And, in Waziristan, was he trained by the good Taliban, the ones the Pakistani military is trying to protect, or the bad Taliban, the ones it is trying to kill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or was he told about the Ahmadis after he had come all the way to the vast, grassy compound on the outskirts of Lahore where doctors and professors and businessmen -- and even, it is said, some bureaucrats and landowners and military men -- converge now and then to hang out with the masses and talk about the ways and woes of Islam?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several theories now, with several competing culprits. It's hard to pick just one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan killed at least 16 militants on Saturday as they were making plans to go fight NATO forces in Afghanistan, residents and an intelligence official said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said a single missile, believed to have been fired from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft, struck a government water-supply plant in the village of Haider Khel, near the town of Mir Ali, where the group was meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the concrete, government-built structures in the area, like schools, hospitals and water plants, have been occupied by militants, who use them to meet and for training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The residents said that 11 of the dead were foreigners, mostly Arabs and some Uzbeks. An additional 19 people were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The compound is near the border of Haider Khel and Hassu Khel, two villages that are militant strongholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The North Waziristan tribal area borders Afghanistan and is a base of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of an insurgent network blamed by the Americans for recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kabul, the Afghan capital. North Waziristan is also the place where the American authorities say that Faisal Shahzad, who is accused of trying to bomb Times Square, was trained in explosives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect in the failed Times Square bombing pleaded guilty on Monday, an abrupt and expedited end to a terrorism case that extended to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an Islamic militant group there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The defendant, Faisal Shahzad, 30, listened as each of 10 counts was read to him in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and indicated he understood the charges and penalties he faced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad recounted how and why he conceived the plot, traveling to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, joining the Taliban and receiving training in how to construct a bomb. And despite his admission of guilt and his extended cooperation with the authorities since his arrest, Mr. Shahzad was unapologetic, characterizing himself as ''part of the answer to the U.S. terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I want to plead guilty, and I'm going to plead guilty 100 times over,'' he said, ''because until the hour the U.S. pulls its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, and stops the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Somalia and Yemen and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and stops the occupation of Muslim lands, and stops killing the Muslims, and stops reporting the Muslims to its government, we will be attacking U.S., and I plead guilty to that.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plea and Mr. Shahzad's comments came four days after a federal grand jury returned an indictment that offered new details about the government's accusations that Tehrik-i-Taliban, the umbrella organization for the Pakistani Taliban, had assisted Mr. Shahzad in his plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In court, he admitted receiving the training, saying he had gone to find the Taliban and learned how to build a bomb that he planned to detonate as part of his plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''With them, I did the training to wage an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside the United States of America,'' Mr. Shahzad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Any kind of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of Federal District Court asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would have been any kind of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Mr. Shahzad said, ''but I was given bomb training, and that's what I learned there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wearing a white head covering, Mr. Shahzad stood for more than half an hour answering the judge's questions about his motivations, his background and even his family. ''I had a wife and two beautiful kids,'' he said, adding that they had returned to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be with his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it was seemingly with equanimity that Mr. Shahzad spoke of his plan to detonate a car bomb in New York City. ''I chose the center of Times Square,'' he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Were there a lot of people in the street?'' Judge Cedarbaum asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes,'' Mr. Shahzad replied. ''Obviously the time, it was evening, and obviously it was a Saturday, so that's the time I chose.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You wanted to injure a lot of people?'' the judge asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad said that he had, that he wanted ''to injure people or kill people.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he said ''one has to understand where I'm coming from.'' He said that he considered himself ''a Muslim soldier,'' and that United States and NATO forces had attacked Muslim lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judge Cedarbaum interjected: ''But not the people who were walking in Times Square that night. Did you look around to see who they were?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad replied, ''Well, the people select the government; we consider them all the same.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Including the children?'' the judge asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hits in Afghanistan and Iraq,'' Mr. Shahzad replied, ''they don't see children; they don't see anybody. They kill women, children. They kill everybody. It's a war. And in war, they kill people. They're killing all Muslims.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The guilty plea was consistent with Mr. Shahzad's behavior since his May 3 arrest, when the authorities say he began cooperating with them for more than two weeks without counsel and waived his Miranda rights. One question was whether Mr. Shahzad would seek leniency in sentencing in return for his assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The answer seemed to come after the hearing, when the United States attorney, Preet Bharara, released a letter that had been sent to Mr. Shahzad's lawyers. It made clear that there was no plea deal, and that in choosing to plead guilty to all 10 counts, Mr. Shahzad faced a mandatory life term, the maximum sentence for which he is eligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Faisal Shahzad plotted and launched an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that could have led to serious loss of life,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, ''and today the American criminal justice system ensured that he will pay the price for his actions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bharara said the investigation was continuing; his office refused to comment on whether Mr. Shahzad was continuing to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judge Cedarbaum scheduled the sentencing for Oct. 5. Mr. Shahzad's lawyer, Philip L. Weinstein, had no comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad's plea came on a day when he was to be arraigned on the recent indictment. But when the hearing began at midday, Mr. Weinstein and a prosecutor, Brendan R. McGuire, left for about 15 minutes for a meeting with Judge Cedarbaum. The judge then returned and announced that the parties had asked that the hearing be delayed until later that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When court resumed just after 4:30, it quickly became clear that Mr. Shahzad would plead guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge told him that the first charge he faced was attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. How do you plead? the judge asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I do plead guilty to this charge,'' Mr. Shahzad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I gather you want to plead guilty to all of them,'' the judge said later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes,'' Mr. Shahzad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout the session, Mr. Shahzad did not raise his voice and answered the judge's questions straightforwardly. There were also no outbursts from the spectators. At one point, Mr. Shahzad said he wanted to read ''a small statement,'' but Judge Cedarbaum told him to wait. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he tried again later, she said: ''Please, don't read it. I want to know what happened. Tell me what you did.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad said he became an American citizen last spring and left for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in June. He spent six months with family in Peshawar, he said, and left in December with a couple of friends to join the Taliban in Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was there for 40 days, and he said he spent 5 days receiving bomb training from Tehrik-i-Taliban. It was there that he developed his bomb plot, he said. ''I made a pact with them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He returned to the United States in February, he said, carrying about $8,000 in cash, half from the Taliban. Later he needed more money, he said, adding, ''They sent it to me twice,'' once in March and once in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad described building three explosive devices in his home in Bridgeport, Conn., and placing them inside the Nissan Pathfinder that he later drove to Times Square. He said the main component of the device was a fertilizer-based bomb held in a gun cabinet in the Pathfinder's trunk. If that bomb did not work, his plans were to detonate propane gas cylinders and to start a fire in the car with gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He set the device to explode in about five minutes, he said, and then walked away. The bombs did not go off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And I don't know the reason why,'' Mr. Shahzad said. ''I was waiting to hear a sound, but I couldn't hear any sound, so I thought it probably didn't go off. So I just walked to the Grand Central and went home.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dawn broke on July 10, 2007, Pakistani commandos stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad, ending a lengthy standoff with armed militants in a blaze of gunfire that left more than 100 dead. In Washington, officials applauded the siege as an important demonstration of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willingness to confront Islamist militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant living in Connecticut, was outraged. He had prayed at the Red Mosque during visits home. The militant Web sites he frequented portrayed the siege as a brazen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Islam by a corrupt government bent on pleasing America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The episode was pivotal for Mr. Shahzad, setting him on a course to join a militant Pakistani group that would train him in explosives and bankroll his plot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Times Square last month, according to senior American intelligence officials and others who have been briefed on or seen reports of Mr. Shahzad's interrogations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That was the triggering event,'' said a person familiar with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Mr. Shahzad, 30, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to trying to detonate an S.U.V. packed with explosives on May 1, telling a judge that he considered himself ''a Muslim soldier.'' Mr. Shahzad provided new details about his training with the Pakistani Taliban, saying he had five days of instruction in explosives and translated a bomb-making manual from Urdu to English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the aftermath of Mr. Shahzad's failed bombing, the public account of his radicalization has largely focused on his time in America. But precisely how this suburban father and financial analyst came to join a terrorist network in the mountains of Waziristan has remained largely a mystery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interviews with American officials, a senior Pakistani intelligence official and others familiar with the case revealed that Mr. Shahzad came into contact with militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through a chain of friends, starting with Shahid Hussain, a 32-year-old Pakistani whom Mr. Shahzad had met in Bridgeport, Conn., where both men went to business school. Back in Islamabad, the two friends and a third man, Muhammad Shouaib Mughal, set out to join a militant group as early as 2008, finding their way to the Pakistani Taliban through a connection at the Red Mosque, according to the interviews. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban, initially suspected that Mr. Shahzad was a spy, and turned him away, according to the interviews. But they accepted Mr. Mughal, who ultimately persuaded them to admit Mr. Shahzad. During training, he met briefly with the Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, the officials said. After Mr. Shahzad returned to the United States this year, he continued to communicate with the militant group through Mr. Mughal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Mr. Mughal and Mr. Hussain have been arrested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Shahzad's court-appointed lawyer, Philip L. Weinstein, declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crucial Friendships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the years after the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Shahzad's devotion to jihadist propaganda seemed to grow in tandem with the pressures of his life in Connecticut, where he owned a home and worked for a financial marketing firm, straining at times to support his budding family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, interviews with American officials suggest that Mr. Shahzad's visits to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the friendships he formed there were critical to his militant evolution. Mr. Shahzad seemed to lack ''validation'' from his family and work environment, finding it instead with ''a bunch of like-minded brothers,'' said an administration official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad appears to fit a pattern among young Muslims in the United States who have joined militant groups over the last year. In contrast to their predecessors -- the 9/11-era jihadist leaders who framed their movement in religious terms -- Mr. Shahzad and other recent recruits carry the attributes of ''foot soldiers,'' driven less by religious rhetoric than by personal bonds and their sense of obligation to the ummah, or global Muslim community, the American officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's much more attached to kinship with other Muslims,'' a senior administration official said. Mr. Shahzad seemed motivated by the duty he felt toward his fellow Muslims and his loyalty to the friends who trained with him in Waziristan, the official said. In court on Monday, Mr. Shahzad said he had made a ''pact'' with the Pakistani Taliban that he would </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also told the judge that ''until the hour the U.S. pulls its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan''; halts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yemen and Somalia; and stops killing Muslims, ''we will be attacking U.S. and I plead guilty to that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Raised as the privileged son of a senior military officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Shahzad arrived in Bridgeport in 2000, where he enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Bridgeport. There he met Mr. Hussain, a business student who had been raised in Islamabad, the son of a civil servant. Mr. Hussain was a bright student who ''wanted to excel in life,'' his brother said in an interview. For a time, Mr. Hussain and Mr. Shahzad appeared to have been roommates in Norwalk, Conn., where Mr. Hussain worked as an accountant for  DHL. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad struck his peers as fun-loving and professionally ambitious. But by 2004, things started to change. A longtime critic of American foreign policy, Mr. Shahzad began dabbling in jihadist ideology, listening to the Internet sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born imam, and Abdullah el-Faisal, a Jamaican cleric, according to a person familiar with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad took to sending incendiary e-mail messages to friends, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times. (The text of one message matches an essay posted the same month, under another name, on a  jihadist Web site that is now defunct.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A New Turn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While in some ways, Mr. Shahzad appeared to be thriving -- he had married a Pakistani-American from Colorado, bought a home in Shelton, Conn., and, by 2006, was en route to becoming an American citizen and a father -- he seemed frustrated. ''I got this impression of a guy who just looked at his life prospects and felt unfulfilled by it all,'' said an American administration official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On frequent trips home to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Shahzad seemed to be forming a new circle of friends. In Islamabad, he reconnected with Mr. Hussain, his former college friend, who had moved back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after briefly living in Plantation, Fla., and then Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men sometimes prayed at Lal Masjid, or the Red Mosque, a hotbed for militancy. By the summer of 2007, the mosque had drawn international attention as its cane-wielding students, intent on installing a theocracy, kidnapped Chinese masseuses,   raided music stores and took police officers hostage. It is unclear whether Mr. Shahzad was in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when the government's security forces stormed the mosque in July, but he was ''close to individuals who were associated with that event and that mosque,'' an American administration official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If before the siege Mr. Shahzad and Mr. Hussain were on the sidelines of militancy, ''they heated up after what happened,'' said a person familiar with the case. ''They realized that more than sympathy was required.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 2008, Mr. Hussain had introduced Mr. Shahzad to Muhammad Shouaib Mughal, the owner of a computer store in Islamabad. Initially, they met to discuss a problem with Mr. Shahzad's computer, but soon found a common interest in the global jihad, an American official said. The men, along with other friends, began meeting at one another's homes. ''They want to do something, but they don't know what to do,'' said a person familiar with the case. ''They are searching for anybody who can give them the opportunity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That opportunity came at the Red Mosque, where the men met the 17-year-old nephew of a Pakistani Taliban leader who offered to connect them to the network, said the person familiar with the case. But the group passed on Mr. Shahzad, whose father's military background led them to suspect that he was a spy, according to Pakistani and American officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad remained determined. He asked his father for permission to join the mujahedeen in Afghanistan; his father declined. An imam in the city of Rawalpindi, south of Islamabad, told Mr. Shahzad to obey his father, said a person familiar with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Return to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 2009, Mr. Shahzad decided he no longer wanted to live in the United States. After getting his United States citizenship in April, he moved back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while his wife and two children went to live with her parents in Saudi Arabia, according to a relative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that year, while Mr. Shahzad was staying with his parents in Peshawar, he became incensed by American-led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal region of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bordering Afghanistan. Mr. Shahzad, who is of Pashtun lineage, called Mr. Hussain and said, ''They're killing Pashtuns,'' the Pakistani official said. Mr. Hussain was ''against innocent people dying in the tribal areas because of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' his brother, Khalid Hussain, said in an interview, adding that most Pakistanis shared that view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shahzad also reached out to Mr. Mughal, who by then had trained with the Pakistani Taliban, earning enough credibility to persuade them that Mr. Shahzad was not a spy, according to people familiar with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Let's go,'' Mr. Shahzad told Mr. Mughal on the phone, according to a person familiar with the case. In December, the three men met in Mr. Mughal's home in Rawalpindi, then drove to Waziristan, where Mr. Mughal left them with an instructor and two aides, according to the interviews. Over the next five weeks, Mr. Shahzad, Mr. Hussain and a third recruit underwent boot-camp-style training, followed by instruction in bomb making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Pakistani Taliban leaders realized that Mr. Shahzad carried an American passport, they asked him to return to the United States to carry out an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and discussed possible targets with him, said people familiar with the case. The group initially gave Mr. Shahzad $4,000 in cash, he said in court. After he returned to New York on Feb. 2, Mr. Shahzad stayed in contact with the group through Mr. Mughal, who remained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They communicated about logistics and Mr. Mughal wired him additional installments of cash; the indictment against Mr. Shahzad says he received $12,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Shahzad was arrested May 3 trying to flee the country following his bombing attempt, he cooperated with the investigation, officials said. Soon after, the Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Mughal, Mr. Hussain and others in their circle, including a catering company executive and a retired army major, who has since been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During a visit to Islamabad on Sunday, Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said that both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and America shared responsibility for the fact that Mr. Shahzad had ''slipped through our nets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Neither country paid enough attention to the warning signs,'' he said. ''We are working with the Pakistanis to tighten our methods of trying to locate and prevent that in advance.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The country's attention was riveted last week by the drama of the generals: Stanley McChrystal, whose indiscretions in Rolling Stone got him cashiered, and his boss, David Petraeus, who stepped in to take  direct command of the troubled Afghanistan counterinsurgency effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a startling scene in a Manhattan courtroom on Monday may have had more to say than the command shake-up about the larger fight to contain Al Qaeda and its allies, and the limits of any general's ability to affect its outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a plea hearing, a defiant Faisal Shahzad admitted trying to blow up an S.U.V. in Times Square on May 1. Calling himself ''a Muslim soldier,''  he explained his motivation: ''avenging'' the war in Afghanistan and American interventions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Iraq, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am part of the answer to the U.S. terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people,'' Mr. Shahzad  said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His candid confession raised two questions: Has the military's still-expanding fight against terrorism now become the fuel for terrorism, recruiting more militants than it kills?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And where exactly does the Afghan war fit into the overall campaign against terror, when the enemy's cause can lure a man like Mr. Shahzad, a former financial analyst for the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics company in Stamford, Conn., and a naturalized American citizen?   The questions take on particular urgency because Mr. Shahzad's flubbed bombing was the latest of a dozen plots since last year aimed at American targets. And in case after case, nine years after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plotters have cited America's still-growing military entanglement in the Muslim world as proof that the United States is at war with Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One major reason for these plots  is that the war on terrorism has been going on as long as it has,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. ''After nine years, our enemies have become more adept and sophisticated at exploiting the sentiments and images of war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama has defined the United States' interest in Afghanistan in terms of protecting the American homeland. But General Petraeus's counterinsurgency credo  --  ''clear, hold, build''  --  is difficult enough to pull off in the hostile terrain of Kandahar Province. It is impossible on the infinite landscape of the Web, where Mr. Shahzad found the ideology that led him to terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're still focused on the nation and not the network,'' said John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School. ''You can do brilliantly in Afghanistan and still not deal with the Faisal Shahzads of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration's Afghan strategy still commands broad support from Democrats and Republicans and from outside specialists, who offer a familiar catechism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that the Taliban have taken the initiative again, only a concentrated NATO effort can prevent their return to power, with a possible new base for Al Qaeda, officials say. True, the dwindling Qaeda core is over the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but Mr. Obama has escalated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there to pick off some terrorist leaders and keep the rest on the run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even in an age of virtual reality, Al Qaeda can't do large-scale training and mobilization unless they control some terrain,'' said Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports the current policy. If the terror network attracts young Muslims now, he said, imagine its appeal if NATO abandoned the field and the militants could claim victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would be a huge symbolic defeat for the United States, as it was for the Soviet Union,'' said Mr. Boot, who is writing a history of guerrilla war and terrorism. ''It would greatly embolden Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Proponents of the current escalation of troops and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> point out as well that even Mr. Shahzad was not turned into a terrorist solely by the Web. He met face-to-face with leaders and trainers of the Pakistani Taliban before crossing the line into violence. So allowing extremists more room to operate on either side of the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border would be a dangerous mistake, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, many scholars who study terror see the interplay of risks and benefits differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The more deeply we're involved in that region, the more likely it is that we'll have terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here,'' said Scott Atran, an anthropologist who interviewed many young Muslim men about the lure of terrorism for his new book, ''Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These lost, young guys see the resistance as heroic and glorious,'' Mr. Atran said. ''Don't give them the thrill of fighting the greatest army in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accused in recent plots aimed at the United States are a diverse group, including an Army psychiatrist of Palestinian ancestry spraying gunfire at Fort Hood, Tex.; a popular coffee vendor from Afghanistan planning to blow up the New York subway; the son of a prominent Nigerian banker trying to take down an airliner over Detroit; and Mr. Shahzad, a Pakistani-American who loaded his Nissan Pathfinder with fertilizer, propane and gasoline in fortunately ineffectual combination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet they all appear to have imagined themselves as warriors against the enemies of their faith. Their national or ethnic loyalties had been supplanted by loyalty to their co-religionists, the global community of Muslims, known as the ummah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maj. Nidal Hasan, accused of killing 13 people in the Fort Hood shooting spree last November, had quoted the Koran in a 2007 PowerPoint demonstration to explain why some Muslim American soldiers might feel conflicted: ''And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his punishment is hell.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If Muslim groups can convince Muslims that they are fighting for God against injustices of the 'infidels,' '' Major Hasan wrote, ''then Muslims can become a potent adversary; i.e. suicide bombing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the path to violence appears to involve less scripture than solidarity. ''We Muslims are one community,'' Mr. Shahzad told the judge at his plea hearing, explaining why he felt obliged to defend strangers in Afghanistan, Iraq, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yemen, Somalia and Gaza -- as well as the United States, where he suggested that Muslims were singled out for government scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as the Obama administration smoothly handled the McChrystal flap and regrouped behind its Afghanistan policy, word came in a report in The New York Times on Friday of diplomatic maneuvering between Afghan and Pakistani leaders that could result in a separate peace, potentially leaving the American generals with 100,000 troops and no one to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Managed deftly, such a deal conceivably might allow Mr. Obama to exit Afghanistan without fear of a Qaeda haven. But since the notion of an American-led war on Muslims has gone viral, the virus would take years or perhaps decades to burn out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trouble with terrorism is what the theorists call asymmetry. Hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of troops, and the best generals on the planet can be undercut by a disgruntled accountant, commanding the world's attention with a bomb that didn't even explode.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 19</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">804 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the grim paradox of America's involvement in Afghanistan: The darker things get and the more setbacks we suffer, the better the odds that we'll be staying there indefinitely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not the way we're there today, with 90,000 American troops in-theater and an assortment of NATO allies fighting alongside.  But if the current counterinsurgency campaign collapses, it almost guarantees that some kind of American military presence will be propping up some sort of Afghan state in 2020 and beyond. Failure promises to trap us; success is our only ticket out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why? Because of three considerations. First, the memory of 9/11, which ensures that any American president will be loath to preside over the Taliban's return to power in Kabul. Second, the continued presence of Al Qaeda's leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> northwest frontier, which makes it difficult for any American president to contemplate giving up the base for counterterrorism operations that Afghanistan affords. Third, the larger region's volatility:  it's the part of the world where  the nightmare of nuclear-armed terrorists is most likely to become a reality, so no American president can afford to upset the balance of power by pulling out and leaving a security vacuum behind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This explains why the Obama administration, throughout all its internal debates and strategic reviews, hasn't been choosing between remaining in Afghanistan and withdrawing from the fight. It's been choosing between two ways of staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first is what we're doing now: the counterinsurgency campaign that  Gen. David Petraeus championed (and now has been charged with seeing through), which seeks to lay the foundations for an Afghan state that's stable enough to survive without our support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second way is the ''counterterrorism-plus'' strategy that Vice President Joe Biden, among other officials, proposed  last fall   as a lower-cost alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Advocates of a swift withdrawal tend to see Biden as their ally, and in a sense they're right. His plan would reduce America's footprint in Afghanistan, and probably reduce American casualties as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in terms of the duration of American involvement, and the amount of violence we deal out, this kind of strategy might actually produce the bloodier and more enduring stalemate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It wouldn't actually eliminate the American presence, for one thing. Instead, such a plan would concentrate our forces around the Afghan capital, protecting the existing government while seeking deals with some  elements of the insurgency. History suggests that such bargains would last only as long as American troops remained in the country, which means that our soldiers would be effectively trapped  --  stuck defending a Potemkin state whose leader (whether Hamid Karzai or a slightly less corrupt  successor) would pose as Afghanistan's president while barely deserving the title of mayor of Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, by abandoning any effort to provide security to the Afghan people and relying instead on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and special forces raids, this  approach would probably produce a spike in the kind of civilian casualties that have already darkened America's reputation in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This grim possibility is implicit in the Rolling Stone profile that undid Gen. Stanley McChrystal last week. Ostensibly a left-wing, antiwar critique of counterinsurgency, Michael Hastings's article relied heavily on complaints that the current strategy places too much value on ... innocent Afghan lives. ''In a weird way,'' the Center for a New American Security's Andrew Exum pointed out, Hastings ended up  criticizing counterinsurgency strategy  ''because it doesn't allow our soldiers to kill enough people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such ironies suggest that if the current strategy proves ineffectual, the alternative that the Obama administration falls back on won't be remotely antiwar. Instead, it will be a recipe for still more dead Afghans and a near-permanent military presence. And in the long run, it will mean more enemies like Faisal Shahzad, the would-be Times Square  bomber, who cited civilian casualties in Afghanistan as his prime motivation for turning to terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bleakness of this Plan B is the best argument for giving our military the time it needs to try to make a counterinsurgency succeed. We can't hold the current course indefinitely, and we won't: President Obama's decision to set a public deadline was a mistake, but everyone knows there are limits to how long the surge of forces can go on. But of the options this White House seems willing to consider, it's the one that holds out hope of enabling a real withdrawal from Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So this is what General  Petraeus will be fighting for, across the next year and more  --  not to keep us in forever, but to seize what may be our last chance at getting out. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency both reacted with skepticism on Sunday about the prospects for an Afghanistan peace deal pushed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> between the Afghan government and some Taliban militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Obama said a political solution to the conflict was necessary and suggested elements of the Taliban insurgency could be part of negotiations, he said any such effort must be viewed with caution. The C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, was even more forceful in expressing his doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have seen no evidence that they are truly interested in reconciliation, where they would surrender their arms, where they would denounce Al Qaeda, where they would really try to become part of that society,'' Mr. Panetta said on ABC's ''This Week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Acknowledging that the American-led counterinsurgency effort was facing unexpected difficulty, Mr. Panetta said that the Taliban and their allies had little motive to contemplate a power-sharing arrangement in Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've seen no evidence of that and very frankly, my view is that with regards to reconciliation, unless they're convinced that the United States is going to win and that they're going to be defeated, I think it's very difficult to proceed with a reconciliation that's going to be meaningful,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama, speaking later after the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto, noted that as the Afghanistan war approached its 10th anniversary, it was the longest foreign war in American history, and that ''ultimately as was true in Iraq, so will be true in Afghanistan, we will have to have a political solution.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort to broker talks, Mr. Obama added: ''I think it's too early to tell. I think we have to view these efforts with skepticism but also with openness. The Taliban is a blend of hard-core ideologues, tribal leaders, kids that basically sign up because it's the best job available to them. Not all of them are going to be thinking the same way about the Afghan government, about the future of Afghanistan. And so we're going to have to sort through how these talks take place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president avoided any direct comment on whether the Haqqani network, the Taliban element reportedly proposed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as part of a deal, could become part of Afghanistan's future leadership. But he said that ''conversations between the Afghan government and the Pakistani government, building trust between those two governments, are a useful step.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The comments Sunday were the administration's first public response to a report of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deal-brokering efforts last week in The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta and Mr. Obama spoke after a major shake-up in the American military leadership, in which the president dismissed his top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, replacing him with Gen. David H. Petraeus. Mr. Obama said the American strategy in Afghanistan would not change, and the Senate Armed Services Committee scheduled a confirmation hearing for General Petraeus for Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta acknowledged that the administration's counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan, based in part on the deployment of 30,000 more American troops, was off to a troubled start, though he insisted it was making progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's harder, it's slower than I think anyone anticipated,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta, who turns 72 on Monday, is a former congressman from California and White House chief of staff in the Clinton administration with no intelligence background before Mr. Obama named him to head the C.I.A. early last year. But he has used his political skills and deep Washington experience to become a powerful intelligence leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his ABC ''This Week'' appearance, Mr. Panetta reiterated the goal that Mr. Obama had set for the Afghan war: ''The fundamental purpose, the mission that the president has laid out is that we have to go after Al Qaeda. We've got to disrupt and dismantle Al Qaeda and their militant allies so they never </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this country again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That goal helps to explain administration skepticism of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort to broker reconciliation between the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai and the militant Haqqani network, part of the Afghan Taliban coalition that has close ties to Al Qaeda and has been blamed for many bloody </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have said reconciliation with some rank-and-file Taliban fighters will most likely be necessary for peace, but they have resisted any power-sharing deal with such Afghan Taliban leaders as Sirajuddin Haqqani and his father, Jalaluddin, or with Mullah Muhammad Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Karzai and Pakistani leaders believe that with the United States scheduled to begin a withdrawal next year, it makes sense to work aggressively toward a coalition that would involve elements of the Karzai government and the Taliban, both largely from the dominant Pashtun ethnic group. That has led to nervousness on the part of Tajiks and other ethnic minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta admitted that despite the C.I.A.'s aggressive campaign against Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas -- primarily using missiles fired from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft -- the hunt for Osama bin Laden had made little progress. He said the last precise information on the Qaeda leader's whereabouts came in ''the early 2000s.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Authorities are alarmed by the recent flurry of terrorist plots and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at the United States, Mr. Panetta said, most recently the failed car-bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Times Square on May 1. He said such plotters had included both people directed by Al Qaeda as well as ''self-radicalized'' militants like Maj. Nidal Hasan, accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Together, he said, the plotters ''represent I think the most serious threat to the United States right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Iran, Mr. Panetta declared publicly what officials have said privately since late last year: that the administration now believes Iran is continuing, at some low level, to work on the design of a nuclear weapon. That contradicts a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. But he also said he believed it would take Iran two years to convert its current stockpile of nuclear material into deliverable weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta admitted to a disagreement with Israel's intelligence services over whether Iranian leaders had decided to produce a weapon; American intelligence believes the decision has not been made. But he said the Israelis are ''willing to give us the room to be able to try to change Iran diplomatically and culturally and politically, as opposed to changing them militarily.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the recently passed sanctions on Iran might ''help weaken the regime,'' but added: ''Will it deter them from their ambitions with regard to nuclear capability? Probably not.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Eight militants, including an Egyptian allied with Al Qaeda, were killed Tuesday in what residents and a Pakistani security official said was a United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the South Waziristan tribal area near this country's Afghan border. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has intensified its campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against suspected militants in the border areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but most have been concentrated in North Waziristan, an area that Western officials consider the most important refuge for militants with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tuesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the second within a few weeks in South Waziristan after a lull that lasted months. Last October, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invaded part of South Waziristan to drive out militants; many who fled north are now returning south. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was believed to have fired two missiles at a compound in a village near Wana, the regional capital. The Egyptian, Hamza al-Jufi, had lived in Wana for many years, said a fighter in the area who visited the site after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and spoke by telephone. Most of the other militants killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lived nearby, though two came from another province, Punjab, the fighter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighter said that the eight bodies were mutilated beyond recognition but that no one else was wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which leveled the compound in the village, Ghwakhwai. According to some accounts Mr. Jufi was leading a group called Jundullah, or Army of God, which Pakistani security officials said was involved in sectarian violence around the port city of Karachi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 19, militants affiliated with Jundullah barged into the city courts there and freed three of their members from police custody while one arrested militant and a policeman were killed in an exchange of fire. The freed militants had been arrested by the police and were suspected of involvement in episodes of sectarian violence in Karachi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to security officials, the militants were working under Mr. Jufi, a well-known figure in South Waziristan who was said to have survived a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2008. The area around his base of Wana is controlled by the Waziri commander Maulvi Nazir, who has been accused of sheltering foreign fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda and of sending militants to Afghanistan to fight American-led forces there. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK MAZZETTI; David E. Sanger reported from Aspen, Colo., and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASPEN, Colo. -- Michael E. Leiter, one of the country's top counterterrorism officials, said Wednesday that American intelligence officials now estimated that there were somewhat ''more than 300'' Qaeda leaders and fighters hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, a rare public assessment of the strength of the terrorist  group that is the central target of President Obama's war strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taken together with the recent estimate by the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, that there are about 50 to 100 Qaeda operatives now in Afghanistan, American intelligence agencies believe that there are most likely fewer than 500 members of the group in a region where the United States has poured nearly 100,000 troops. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many American officials warn about such comparisons, saying that Al Qaeda has forged close ties with a number of affiliated militant groups and that a large American troop presence is necessary to helping the Afghan government prevent Al Qaeda from gaining a safe haven in Afghanistan similar to what it had before the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that on a recent trip to the region he was struck by the ''depth of synergies'' between Al Qaeda and a number of other insurgent groups, including the Pakistani and the Afghan Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Leiter, who is the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, concurred with Admiral Mullen's judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But with the fighting in Afghanistan intensifying and few indications that the Taliban are weakening, the recent estimates of Al Qaeda's strength could give ammunition to critics of President Obama's strategy who think the United States should pull most of its troops from the country and instead rely on small teams of Special Operations forces and missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Mr. Leiter and Admiral Mullen were speaking at the same homeland security conference at the  Aspen Institute, sponsored in part by The New York Times. Mr. Panetta's public remarks came last Sunday on ABC's ''This Week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Leiter told the audience on Wednesday that ''we've had some incredible successes'' against Al Qaeda's leadership. Echoing Mr. Panetta's assessment, he said the group ''is weaker today than it has been at any time since 2001.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he quickly added, ''Weaker does not mean harmless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials talk increasingly about the dangers posed by militant groups affiliated with Al Qaeda, saying they have both the intent and the capabilities to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States. The man accused of trying  to detonate a vehicle in Times Square in May received training from the Pakistani Taliban, a group once thought to be interested only in attacking inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. On Dec. 25, a young Nigerian man tried to blow up a transatlantic jetliner on its way to Detroit after being trained by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Yemen-based terror group, officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Leiter's organization was one of those criticized for failing to thwart the Dec. 25 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by placing the man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, on a no-fly list. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Leiter said that ''the threshold has been lowered'' for placing individuals with suspected links to terror groups on that list, though he would not describe the new criteria. He said that Mr. Abdulmutallab was on a list of suspects ''available to 10,000 people'' inside the United States government, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAZMAK, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- On an operating table at a makeshift trauma center at this military base in North Waziristan, a Pakistani soldier lay anesthetized, blood-soaked bandages applied in the field just an hour earlier a testament to a near-fatal wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bullet through his neck from a Taliban militant had narrowly missed an artery, and after some minor surgery, the army medics declared the patient, Sepoy Aziz, out of danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an offensive nearly two years old, the Pakistani Army has been fighting Taliban militants in the nation's tribal areas and beyond, and like the United States across the border in Afghanistan, it is finding counterinsurgency warfare tougher, and more costly, than anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Months after declaring victory on several important fronts, including in South Waziristan and the Swat Valley, the army has been forced to reopen campaigns after militants seeped back in. True victory remains elusive. Soldiers like Sepoy Aziz -- a sepoy is the rough equivalent of a private -- are killed and wounded almost daily. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much like the challenge facing American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, an absence of Pakistani civilian authority has made it nearly impossible to consolidate military gains. While eliminating some Pakistani Taliban insurgents, the long campaign has dispersed many other fighters, forcing the Pakistani Army in effect to chase them from one part of the tribal areas to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the campaign drags on, the Pakistani military relies more and more on American-supplied F-16 fighter jets and Cobra helicopter gunships to bomb militants in areas of treacherous terrain, increasing civilian casualties, according to reporters and Pakistani officials in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of the Pakistani Taliban fighters organize and rest here in North Waziristan under the protection of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Afghan Taliban leader who runs a network of several thousand fighters of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Allied with the Taliban and backed by Al Qaeda, the Haqqani group makes up a significant part of the insurgency in Afghanistan, too, and American officials have pressed the Pakistani Army for an offensive against them. But for now the brunt of the effort against Al Qaeda and the Haqqani fighters is borne by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acquiescence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army says it is too overwhelmed tamping down the Taliban on other fronts in the tribal areas to take on a full-blown campaign in North Waziristan. There is truth to the Pakistani concern about being overstretched, American officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are also deep suspicions that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence service use Mr. Haqqani's force to exert influence in Afghanistan, and keep India at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has even offered to help broker a deal between the Haqqani group and the Afghan government as part of an Afghanistan peace settlement, according to Pakistani and American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, more than 2,000 troops have been killed in the last two years fighting the Pakistani Taliban, the military says. In South Waziristan, Taliban fighters operating in groups of 4 to 15 regularly hit Pakistani soldiers, army officers said. The Taliban use classic guerrilla tactics -- sniper fire, roadside bombs, ambushes -- and their innate knowledge of the terrain to great advantage, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The terrorists have been raised here; they can find their way around blind,'' said Maj. Shahzad Saleem, as small gunfire sounded around the hills near Nawazkot where Sepoy Aziz was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than 120,000 farmers, shopkeepers, women and children who were ordered to leave South Waziristan at the start of the offensive were expected to be back home by now. But the lands here remain devoid of any residents, and the fruit trees laden with summer apricots are untouched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The civilians will be allowed back in stages, starting in about two weeks, and their return will be carried out under the guidance of the army, said Lt. Gen. Asif Yasin Malik, the commander of the army's 11th Corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other parts of the tribal areas to the north, and in the adjacent Swat Valley, which was reclaimed by the army from the Taliban last summer, the Pakistani Army faces similar problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two parts of the tribal region that Pakistani Army commanders had said were secure, Bajaur and Mohmand, have come under renewed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the militants in the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban resurfaced in Bajaur, warning the few residents who had returned not to challenge them. In Mohmand, a border post was taken over by the Taliban after 60 Pakistani soldiers of the Frontier Corps ran out of ammunition -- and nerve, according to a senior army commander -- when several hundred militants operating from Afghanistan attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army has made the most gains in Swat, where bazaars are bustling and some tourist hotels have reopened. But few schools have been rebuilt, and residents complain of slow compensation for reconstruction of ruined homes. Taliban fighters have singled out for assassination key tribal leaders involved in negotiations in Swat for a more permanent political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civilian casualties have become harder to ignore. In April, the head of the army, General Kayani, in a rare statement of apology, acknowledged that more than 70 tribesmen had been killed after what he said were inadvertent aerial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a house in Khyber belonging to a tribal elder loyal to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani military official said, ''There have been no reports of large numbers of civilians who have become casualties.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army opened what it thought would be its final front against the Taliban in March when it deployed five army battalions backed by F-16 jets in an offensive in Orakzai, a part of the tribal areas that became a refuge for Taliban displaced by the campaign in South Waziristan. It has also become a critical staging ground for the Taliban and other militants groups to penetrate the adjacent Punjab Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In June, General Kayani visited Orakzai and congratulated the troops at what was reported as a victory ceremony. But since then Pakistani fighter jets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters and artillery have continued to bomb Orakzai, causing civilian casualties in villages close to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, formerly the North-West Frontier Province, according to local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You can hear bombardments day and night from our house,'' a prominent landowner in Hangu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the account of the landowner, who declined to be identified because of fear of repercussions from the military, seven women and children were killed in May during an air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the village of Shahu Khel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There had been firing between the militants and the army and the next day three helicopters were shelling the village,'' the landowner said. ''There was constant bombardment at about 4 p.m.'' The bodies of three women and seven children were taken to the Civil Hospital in Hangu, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to reports that appeared in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leading English-language newspaper, Dawn, 226 civilians have been killed in the fighting and aerial bombardment in Orakzai since the campaign started in late March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States is satisfied that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is using the American warplanes and helicopters in an appropriate manner, an American military spokesman said. Washington was pleased that General Kayani apologized for the deaths in Khyber, the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In our view the Pakistani Air Force continues to make a concerted effort to minimize collateral damage and fully understand the impact these kinds of incidents can ultimately have on their counterinsurgency efforts,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 16</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1459 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Justice Department released a lengthy list of its successful terrorism prosecutions since 9/11, part of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s response to Republican criticism that the Obama administration had mishandled several international cases by bringing them in the federal courts rather than before military commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the political tumult -- which included charges that the administration had no stomach for the fight against terrorism and had squandered opportunities to collect valuable intelligence because it was too quick to read suspects their Miranda rights -- one aspect of the list attracted little notice: Over the last two years, about one-third of the international terrorism convictions around the nation, and nearly all of those involving the post-9/11 activities of core operatives of Al Qaeda, were won by the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And all of those cases were supervised, and in many instances handled in court, by one assistant United States attorney:  Jeffrey Haworth Knox, a prosecutor who looks like an altar boy, grew up in the conservative environs of Orange County, Calif., and Dallas, and has described himself as a traditional law-and-order Republican.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, by most accounts, some of the cases brought by Mr. Knox, who joined the office's Violent Crime and Terrorism Unit in 2005 and has headed it since 2008, have made him a forceful advocate not only for the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in the fight against terrorism, but also for its importance as a tool to collect intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And his track record would seem to bear him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, in a sealed courtroom in Brooklyn, he and a colleague stood before a United States District Court judge while a Qaeda operative who had received terrorism training, and had met some of the group's senior leaders in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, pleaded guilty to charges including conspiring to kill American citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operative, Bryant Neal Vinas, 27, a convert to Islam, born in New York to an Argentine father and a Bolivian mother and raised and radicalized on Long Island, had already begun cooperating with the F.B.I. and prosecutors, court records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His early statements led almost immediately to successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas, several officials have said, and he later became one of the government's most prized intelligence assets on Al Qaeda's operations and leadership. His information, the officials said, was shared with and used by the United States military, and by intelligence and law enforcement agencies of the United States and its allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This year, Mr. Knox, 37, and a different colleague from the 14-lawyer unit he leads were in court again with another young man, this one born in Afghanistan and raised in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and New York City, who had traveled from the United States to the tribal areas. He had played a central role in an suicide bomb plot directed by Al Qaeda in which he and two high school friends had made three New York City subway lines their planned targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After months of denials, that man, Najibullah Zazi, who also received explosives training and met senior Qaeda leaders in the tribal areas, began to cooperate, providing valuable intelligence, people briefed on the case have said. In February, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and to kill Americans  overseas and other terrorism-related crimes, several of which carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those cases were the culmination of some seven years of work for a prosecutor who, colleagues and combatants, judges and supervisors say, possesses a keen legal mind and an appetite for hard work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The son of a successful management consultant, Mr. Knox graduated from the University of Arizona and Northwestern University School of Law and in 1999 won a job as an associate at the prestigious law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York City, where he was living at the time of the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His superiors in the United States attorney's office declined to make him available for an interview for this article. But friends said that after the American invasion of Afghanistan, reading about American soldiers fighting in caves while he was living a comfortable lifestyle made him, in the words of one friend, want to ''be more a part of what was going on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior lawyer he had worked with at the firm, Valerie Caproni, said she had encouraged him to become a federal prosecutor. Ms. Caproni, then the firm's counsel and now general counsel to the F.B.I., had served as the chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney's office until 2001, and had been responsible for hiring new prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was smart, he was creative, he had very good legal skills, good people skills, good writing skills and good judgment,'' she said. ''For a young lawyer to have that package of skills -- he had exactly what they were looking for.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ronald L. Kuby, once described as perhaps the last of the in-your-face leftist lawyers, is not known for saying nice things about federal prosecutors. And that did not seem to change in recent years when he started representing more and more defendants in terrorism cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So he makes an unlikely advocate for Mr. Knox. But he slipped comfortably into that role recently while talking about a client who pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents in a case related to the prosecution of Mr. Zazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was a sensitive case in a number of different areas, and Jeff dealt with me and the case with a tremendous amount of integrity and great honesty,'' Mr. Kuby said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One of the things Knox is good at,'' he continued, ''is he has a strategic depth in his understanding of people, and so he figures out how to get them to do something he needs them to do, whether it's getting Zazi to cooperate or stalemating someone like me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the reasons that the Brooklyn United States attorney's office has been at the forefront of terrorism prosecutions, according to senior F.B.I. officials, agents and current and former prosecutors, is that agents bring their cases to the Violent Crimes and Terrorism Unit knowing that Mr. Knox has a reputation for getting things done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether it's the care and feeding of cooperating witnesses -- a sometimes complex, labor-intensive and arcane art -- relocating their family members, or more routine tasks, agents say they feel he is easy to work with and focused on their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some people who have worked with Mr. Knox are quick to point out that his easygoing personality and Boy Scout sincerity endear him to juries. But several contend that it is those qualities combined with his willingness to put in the time to master details, be they the particulars of a case, the niceties of an obscure statute or the history, philosophy and the players of a movement like Al Qaeda, that have made him so effective in court and in dealing with potential cooperators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brian J. Murphy is a 13-year F.B.I. agent who has worked on terrorism cases since 9/11, including several with Mr. Knox. He said the prosecutor's knowledge of the culture and roots of Islamic extremism gave him insight into the thinking of many of the witnesses and defendants he met and enabled him to treat them with an understanding and respect that often won them over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is truly a subject matter expert in the field of terrorism these days, and that is a rare gift,'' Agent Murphy said. ''I think a lot of people claim to be, but actually lack kind of the first-hand experience, where Jeff has talked to so many of these guys now and has got so much experience that he's able to kind of cut through things.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This summer, Mr. Knox is leaving the Brooklyn office to work at the Justice Department in Washington, where he will join an elite unit that prosecutes violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a United States law that makes it illegal to bribe officials abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While he will continue to handle the cases involving Mr. Zazi and Mr. Vinas in Brooklyn, his new job will be working with a team of prosecutors responsible for investigating and trying what the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, said are some of the biggest and most significant foreign corruption prosecutions the government can bring.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting with violent Salvadoran gangs in Honduras. Seeking radioactive material at a university in Hamilton, Ontario. Running an import-export business and teaching English -- wife and child in tow -- in Morocco. Hiding out in Suriname. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are just some of the points of interest on the trail -- or, to be more precise, the rumored trail -- of an American citizen who spent part of his youth in Brooklyn, went to college in Florida and has long been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most-wanted list, a senior Qaeda operative who over the last seven years has been portrayed as part wraith, part James Bond, and large-scale bogeyman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn formally named that citizen, Adnan G. el-Shukrijumah, in an official case, charging him with crimes that the authorities say were all too real: the bomb plot last summer to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> three New York City subway lines and what they said was a related plot, one that British authorities said included a plan to blow up a shopping center in Manchester, England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a Justice Department news release announcing the charges, Mr. Shukrijumah, 34, was one of a panel of three men overseeing Al Qaeda's efforts to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and other Western countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in that role, he helped recruit three young men for the subway plot -- men who had attended high school together in New York City and had traveled to the tribal areas in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for terror training, the news release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Saudi-born naturalized American, the elusive Mr. Shukrijumah was the focus of intense attention in the months after the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because of his citizenship, his knowledge of the United States and, eventually, the realization that he was tied to senior Qaeda operatives and possibly involved in a dirty-bomb plot. United States officials have offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he seemed to drop off the radar screens of law enforcement and intelligence agencies about five years ago, and quickly became the subject of rumors. For a period of time, was reportedly sighted in locales including Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, southern Florida and Yemen. He remains at large, officials said, and some experts believe that he has long been in hiding in the tribal areas, discounting the myriad sightings reported elsewhere around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He very much disappeared,'' said Evan F. Kohlmann, a veteran terrorism analyst with Flashpoint Global Partners in New York who has consulted for the government, referring to Mr. Shukrijumah. ''There were reports of him surfacing all over the place, but I don't believe he was ever there. I believe he was back in Waziristan, which is the only safe place he could hide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 10-count indictment charges Mr. Shukrijumah and three other men with a range of crimes in connection with the New York subway plot, which prosecutors say Mr. Shukrijumah helped organize, and the planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Manchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It supplements an earlier indictment brought in Brooklyn charging the three men he recruited for the subway plot, including Najibullah Zazi, whom prosecutors identified as a central figure in that planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Mr. Zazi and a second defendant, Zarein Ahmedzay, 25, have been cooperating with the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors and probably provided some of the information that led to the new indictment. The third defendant, Adis Medunjanin, 26, plans to go to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new charges include conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiring and attempting to commit an act of terrorism across national boundaries, conspiring to provide and providing material support to Al Qaeda and other terrorism-related crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new charges for the first time link the subway plot with a planned Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Britain and contain the government's most detailed account  to date on the development of the subway conspiracy and the identities of its authors in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also describes how Rashid Rauf and Saleh al-Somali -- who prosecutors say were then responsible along with Mr. Shukrijumah for planning Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and other Western countries -- communicated from the tribal areas through ''an Al Qaeda facilitator'' in Peshawar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Both Mr. Rauf and Mr. al-Somali have since been killed in United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas, according to officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The facilitator, according to the authorities, used the same e-mail account to send coded messages to Mr. Zazi, in Denver and New York, and one of the accused Manchester plotters, Abid Naseer, in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The facilitator, who was identified in the indictment only as Ahmad or Zahid, was also charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The indictment was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where it is being prosecuted by the office of Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Naseer was one of 11 men -- 10 of them Pakistanis -- arrested in April 2009 by British authorities who were investigating the Manchester plot in one of that nation's most extensive counterterrorism operations since the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fourth defendant in the new indictment, Tariq Ur Rehman, who was arrested at the same time as Mr. Nasser and later deported, is also at large. Mr. Naseer, who fought deportation, was arrested on Wednesday and is currently in custody in Britain. The United States intends to seek his extradition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Three men who were arrested in Norway and Germany on Thursday on suspicion of terrorism were ''one node'' in the global terror network that plotted the foiled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the New York subway and planned to blow up a shopping center in Manchester, England, European and American counterterrorism officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three Muslim immigrants to Norway -- a Uighur from China, an Iraqi Kurd and an Uzbek -- had ties to operatives of Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Also linked to those operatives were Najibullah Zazi, who tried to organize the subway </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and men arrested in Britain in April 2009 in the Manchester plot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The separate terrorist cells in the three countries were ''three parallel efforts or undertakings that all trace their lineage back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said a senior American intelligence official. The plotters all had ties to Saleh al-Somali, a Qaeda leader who was killed by a C.I.A.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A European intelligence official said the three men were members of the Turkistan Islamic Party, a Uighur separatist group based largely in the lawless Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, which has become a haven for Al Qaeda and other militant groups. The official said the Uighur suspect had visited Waziristan in the past two years and had made contacts with Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest revelations underscored the global connections of the New York subway plot and the continuing capability of the core leaders of Al Qaeda in Waziristan to recruit and direct operatives in the West. But the plotters in all three countries came under the scrutiny of law enforcement and no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three Norway residents had been under surveillance for a year and had begun to work on making a peroxide-based explosive. Norwegian counterterrorism officials wanted to keep watching the group to determine its intended targets, but they moved to arrest the three men in part because The Associated Press had learned about the investigation, Norwegian officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were afraid evidence would be destroyed, because we knew that an international media organization was about to publish details of the case,'' Janne Kristiansen of the Norwegian Police Security Services said Thursday at a news conference. ''That made it urgent to make the arrests.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The A.P., however, said that it had been warned by  the authorities that reporting on the investigation could jeopardize the case, and had agreed not to report on it until arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not clear if Norway had been chosen as a target or was a staging post for a larger conspiracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two of the suspects were arrested in Norway, and the third, the Iraqi, in Germany. Their names were not made public. A statement from the office of the Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said that prosecutors were still investigating the case against the three men and that ''the question of guilt has not yet been decided.'' Under Norwegian law, the suspects can be held for 72 hours without being charged before a judge rules on whether they should remain in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Siv Alsen, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Police Security Service, said in a telephone interview that there could be further arrests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three arrests followed the arrest in England on Wednesday of a man whom the United States is seeking to have extradited in connection with the plot to bomb New York's subway system last year. British prosecutors identified the man as Abid Naseer, 24, who appeared in court in London on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has been accused of planning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Manchester, England, and of communicating with leaders of Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The arrests in Norway also came one day after federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged an American citizen, Adnan G. el-Shukrijumah, with several crimes, including the plot last summer to bomb three New York City subway lines and  what they said was a related plot, one that the British authorities said included blowing up a shopping center in Manchester. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a Justice Department news release announcing the charges, Mr. Shukrijumah, 34, was one of a panel of three men overseeing Al Qaeda's efforts to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and other Western countries. The other two, Mr. Somali and Rashid Rauf, are dead. Mr. Shukrijumah is at large and the United States is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Alsen, the spokeswoman, said the Norwegian authorities had been making preparations for the arrests for about a week before they moved in around 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the men arrested was a 39-year-old Norwegian citizen of Chinese origin who belongs to the Muslim Uighur ethnic group and has been in Norway since 1999, the police said. Another was a 31-year-old Uzbek citizen who arrived in Norway in 2002 and had permanent residency, the police said. The third man was a 37-year-old Iraqi citizen of Kurdish background who also went to Norway in 1999 and has permanent residency. According to news reports and prosecutors, the man was arrested by the state and federal police at 8:30 a.m. Thursday in front of a kindergarten in the western German city of Duisburg. He had been in Germany ''as a tourist,'' said Gunter Wittig, senior prosecutor and spokesman for the prosecutors' office in Frankfurt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Norway has a small contingent with the United States-led coalition fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and is one of several countries cited by Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, as potential targets for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2006, Norwegian newspapers reprinted Danish cartoons that angered Muslims by lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Norwegian officials said that all three men arrested had sought refuge in Norway for humanitarian or political reasons. Knut Storberget, the Norwegian minister of justice and the police, who also oversees the country's immigration authorities, said in a telephone interview that he could not discuss details of the case. But he said that because two of the men had won permanent-resident status and one had become a Norwegian citizen, the case suggested that officials needed to pay greater attention to possible links between immigrants and extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think we need to have more focus on it in the future,'' he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before dawn on Dec. 24, an American cruise missile soared high over the southern coast of the Arabian peninsula, arced down toward the dark mountains above the Rafadh Valley in Yemen's Shabwa province and found its mark, crashing into a small stone house on a hillside where five young men were sleeping. Half a mile away, a 27-year-old Yemeni tribesman named Ali Muhammad Ahmed was awakened by the sound. Stumbling out of bed, he quickly dressed, slung his AK-47 over his shoulder and climbed down a footpath to the valley that shelters his village, two hours from the nearest paved road. He already sensed what had happened. A week earlier, an American airstrike killed dozens of people in a neighboring province as part of an expanded campaign against Al Qaeda militants. (Although the U.S. military has acknowledged playing a role in the airstrikes, it has never publicly confirmed that it fired the missiles.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmed soon came upon the shattered house. Mangled bodies were strewn among the stones; he recognized a fellow tribesman. Scattered near the wreckage were bits of yellow debris with the words ''US Navy'' and long serial numbers written on them. A group of six or seven young men were standing in the dawn half-light, looking dazed. All were members of Al Qaeda. Among them was Fahd al-Quso, a longtime militant who is wanted by the F.B.I. for his suspected role in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 2000. The missile had struck in one of the most remote and inaccessible valleys on earth, in a place where Al Qaeda has been trying to establish a foothold. Quso was the local cell leader and had been recruiting young men for years. Ahmed knew him well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I met Ahmed several weeks later in Sana, the Yemeni capital, where he works part time as a bodyguard. By that time, Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch had claimed credit for a failed effort to detonate a bomb in a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas Day, igniting a global debate about whether Yemen was the next front in the war on terror. Yemen's once-obscure vital statistics were flashing across TV screens everywhere: it is the Arab world's poorest country, with a fast-growing and deeply conservative Muslim population of 23 million. It is running out of oil and may soon be the first country in the world to run out of water. The central government is weak and corrupt, hemmed in by rebellions and powerful tribes. Many fear that Al Qaeda is gaining a sanctuary in the remote provinces east of Sana, similar to the one it already has in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the day I met him, Ahmed - a small, rail-thin man with a bony face - seemed still awed and a bit frightened by what happened in his valley. He was dressed in a tattered blazer and a futa, the patterned cloth skirt Yemeni men often wear. He sat on a sofa leaning forward with his hands on his thighs, glancing occasionally at me. We were in a small, sparely furnished office belonging to Ahmed's employer and friend Abdulaziz al-Jifri, who had given him permission to speak. It was evening, and in the room next door men could be heard laughing and chatting as they drank tea and chewed khat, the narcotic leaf Yemenis use to relax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We took the bodies under the trees,'' Ahmed continued in a quiet voice. ''One was from my tribe. He had just joined Al Qaeda, and that was his first night sleeping with them.'' He paused, and I caught a hint of defensiveness, perhaps also of anger, in his eyes. He seemed reluctant to stray from his narrative, but it was clear that he felt the bombing was an injustice. ''We knew they were Qaeda, but they were young, and they hadn't done anything, and they were locals,'' he said. ''They came and went at checkpoints, and the government didn't seem to care. So we dealt with them normally.. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Later I took the bodies to the graveyard,'' he went on to say. ''Then I talked with Fahd's cousin about what we should do about him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within an hour, Ahmed said, the discussions expanded, and Ali al-Asowad, the aging sheik of the Abdullah tribe, was summoned from his house. The sun was rising over the arid brown hills around Rafadh and soon almost 100 people were sitting under the spreading boughs of an acacia tree for an emergency tribal meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dozens of people spoke. Some were angry. Most people in the valley were related to the dead men or knew them. The victims had scarcely stood out in Rafadh, where everyone carried weapons and hatred of the Yemeni government was nothing unusual. What did it matter that they hated America and called themselves Qaeda? Some of the tribesmen also spoke in defense of Fahd al-Quso, who moved to the area in 2007. His grandfather had a house there, so he had a right to the tribe's protection. But others stood up and shouted angrily that Quso had put the whole tribe in needless danger by basing himself in their village; more American bombs might be coming soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The people of Rafadh had decisions to make, ones that might soon ramify across all of Yemen's remote mountains and deserts and even half a world away in the Pentagon. What did Al Qaeda mean to them? Was it worth protecting? A bargaining chip to be used against a neglectful government? Or just an invitation to needless violence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SANA RESEMBLES A FORTRESS, not just in its architecture but in its geography. It is set on a high plateau, surrounded by arid, craggy mountains. At its heart is the Old City, a thicket of unearthly medieval towers and banded spires that stands out sharply in the dry desert air. This was the entire city until a few decades ago, its high walls locked every evening at dusk. Today Sana is a far more sprawling place, with Internet cafes and swarms of beat-up taxis and a sprinkling of adventure tourists. The Old City gates are mostly gone now, and although men still carry the traditional daggers known as jambiyas in their belts, they also wear blazers, often with cheap designer logos on their sleeves. Like other Arab capitals, it is full of policemen, and there are occasional checkpoints manned by bored-looking soldiers in camouflage uniforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Yemen is different. Beneath the familiar Arab iconography, like pictures of the president that hang in every shop, there is a wildness about the place, a feeling that things might come apart at any moment. A narcotic haze descends on Yemen every afternoon, as men stuff their mouths with glossy khat leaves until their cheeks bulge and their eyes glaze over. Police officers sit down and ignore their posts, a green dribble running down their chins. Taxi drivers get lost and drive in circles, babbling into their cellphones. But if not for the opiate of khat, some say, all of Yemen - not just those areas of the south and north already smoldering with discontent - would explode into rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One morning in Sana, I discovered a crowd of people protesting in the stone courtyard outside the cabinet building. Many had shackle scars on their wrists and ankles. They came from an area called Jaashin, about 100 miles south of the capital. But some of them, I found, did not even know that Jaashin was in the Republic of Yemen. Their only real ruler was the local sheik, Muhammad Ahmed Mansour, who is, it turns out, a kind of latter-day Marquis de Sade. Mansour is also a poet, who earns extra license for his cruelties by writing florid odes to Yemen's president. Some pilgrims from Jaashin said they were imprisoned, shackled and beaten by the sheik - who maintains his own army and several prisons - after refusing to relinquish their property to him. I asked Ahmed Abdu Abdullah al-Haithami, a bent old farmer in a tattered green jacket, what country he was living in. He looked up at me with imploring eyes. ''All I know is that God rules above, and the sheik rules here below,'' he said. All of this, I later learned, was documented by Yemeni lawyers, who have been working on behalf of the people of Jaashin for years to little effect. As one lawyer, Khaled al-Alansi, put it to me, ''If you can't fight sheik Mansour, how can you possibly fight Al Qaeda?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two thousand years ago, the area east of Sana held one of the earth's most prosperous kingdoms, a lush agricultural region of spices and fruits, fed by irrigation canals from a vast man-made dam. The Romans called Yemen ''Arabia Felix,'' or Happy Arabia. Today, the eastern region is an arid wasteland. Most people scrape by on less than $2 a day, even though they live atop Yemen's oil and gas fields. There are few ways to make a living other than smuggling, goat-herding and kidnapping. The region is also, chronically, a war zone. Tribal feuds have always been part of life here, but in recent years they have grown so common and so deadly that as much as a quarter of the population cannot go to school or work for fear of being killed. The feuds often devolve into battles with bands of raiders mowing down their rivals with machine-gun fire or launching mortars into a neighboring village. No one knows how many people die in these wars, but Khaled Fattah, a sociologist who has studied Yemen's tribes for years, told me that hundreds of victims a year is a conservative estimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every time I drive out of Sana I get an ominous sense of going backward in time to a more lawless era. As the city's towers fade in the distance, the houses drop away into level desert and occasional piles of construction rubble. The traffic thins out and consists mostly of pickup trucks carrying tribesmen with patterned cloth kaffiyehs tied around their heads. You pass the first of several checkpoints, where skinny soldiers in ill-fitting uniforms warily circle the car, looking for weapons or kidnapping victims. You pass towering, desolate mountains of black and brown igneous rock. Once you're out of Sana province, there are virtually no signs of the Yemeni state. Every able-bodied man seems to carry an AK-47 rifle over his shoulder; it's not uncommon to see rocket-propelled-grenade launchers. Only the oil and gas fields, hidden behind wire fences and vigilantly watched over by the Yemeni military, seem to merit the government's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year I expected to see at least a few government soldiers when I visited the ancient city of Shibam in Hadramawt, the vast eastern province where Osama bin Laden's father was born. A few months earlier, four South Korean tourists were blown up by a suicide bomber as they admired the view of Shibam from across the valley. I was a little nervous. ''Don't worry,'' my guide said, patting my shoulder as we walked up to the ridge where the Koreans died. ''Ever since the bombing they have put this place on high security.'' But when we got to the top of the ridge there was not a single soldier or policeman to be seen. We gazed out over the valley in silence. A sign stood nearby, showing a pair of binoculars and the words in English ''Discover Islam.'' As we began to leave, my guide smiled broadly and gestured at the sign. ''The Koreans - they discovered Islam,'' he said, giggling at his joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even in the capital, law and order often mean less than they do in other Arab countries. One afternoon I was having tea with Abdulaziz al-Jifri when a shot rang out nearby. I thought nothing of it; it might have been a firecracker or someone testing a gun. We were in the safest area of the city, a neighborhood called Hadda, where rich Yemenis and foreign diplomats have built an enclave in recent decades. But Jifri got up from the cushion where he was sitting to go see what happened. He came back 15 minutes later with a look of surprise on his face. A friend of the family, a wealthy tribal figure, had been shot dead a block away. The victim, Jifri explained, was walking up to the gate of his home when someone apparently shot him once in the head. There were no witnesses and no one even bothered to call the police, who are so corrupt and incompetent that most people view them as useless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no law in Yemen,'' Jifri said, shaking his head. We went on drinking tea and talking politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By then, I had spent at least a dozen afternoons at Jifri's house. He was a unique figure: educated in Britain and Saudi Arabia, he was designated by his father - a wealthy businessman with political connections - as a liaison to the tribes in Shabwa and Marib, two of the main areas where Al Qaeda is said to find sanctuary. He is tall and handsome, with large, mischievous brown eyes and a knack for setting a room on fire with laughter. His family are sayyids, or descendants of the prophet Muhammad, and that gave them a special status in the caste like social hierarchy that prevailed until Yemen's republican revolution in 1962. Even now, the Jifris are trusted and respected like few other clans in rural Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jifri became my link to rural Yemen. There was no way for me to travel to Shabwa or Marib undetected, I was told. So day after day I would sit on a cushion beside him in the family's rectangular living room as various sheiks and relatives from those provinces arrived to sip tea, chew khat and talk until dark about what was happening among the tribes. It was there that I met Ali Muhammad Ahmed, along with others from the area around Rafadh, in Shabwa province, the valley where the cruise missile struck on Dec. 24. The Jifris themselves have a house in the Rafadh Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rafadh, several hundred miles southeast of the capital, is in some ways typical of the areas where Al Qaeda found refuge in Yemen. It is set among dry mountains populated by baboons, there are no paved roads and cars must travel laboriously along dirt tracks that wind among the hills. There is no public water supply or electricity and no functioning school. The valley was largely peaceful during the 1970s and '80s, when the socialist government that ruled South Yemen - a separate country until it united with the north in 1990 - tried to eradicate tribalism. But since then Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has encouraged tribal practices, and the feuds have returned. Rafadh itself has been devastated by a tribal conflict that has raged for years, killing at least a dozen people and wounding many more in an area with only a few hundred inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmed played a central role in the feud. In 2006, Ahmed's father and older brother were gunned down by men posing as customers at the father's market stall. Afterward, he told me, he drove the bullet-riddled bodies to the nearest police station to ask for justice. The police captain in charge waved him off dismissively, he said, telling him, ''You tribes are always causing trouble - deal with it yourself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He did. Ahmed gathered five cousins and together they hunted down and shot two men they believe were among the killers and three other men who were sheltering them. The feud briefly threatened to escalate into a broader war. The government promised to mediate but failed to do so, and the feud grew with further kidnappings and clumsy army suppression. Many local people felt the government was largely to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was then that Fahd al-Quso, the Al Qaeda figure, arrived in the valley. He had roots in the area but, perhaps more important, he was an outlaw to the Yemeni authorities, and that alone earned him a welcome in Rafadh. The United States wanted him in connection with the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. The Yemeni police arrested his younger brother, a tactic aimed at pressuring Quso to turn himself in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Fahd was a victim in the eyes of the tribes,'' Ahmed told me. ''They accepted what he said. People distrust the government here, so those who have problems with it will get sympathy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last summer, as Al Qaeda's Arabian branch began setting off alarms in Washington, Quso became more active, Ahmed told me. ''We saw lots of Al Qaeda guys coming and going from his house,'' Ahmed said. They tended to keep to themselves, refusing to give rides to others from the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the tribesmen of Rafadh continued to shelter Quso and his men and not just because of their shared hatred of the government. Quso had offered to supply teachers for the village school. Local families knew he was with Al Qaeda but welcomed the news for a simple reason: there were no teachers in the school at all. ''The people were saying, 'We would rather have our kids get an Al Qaeda education than be illiterate,' '' Jifri told me. After hearing about Quso's offer, Jifri went to officials in Sana and delivered a blunt message: ''Right now you have one Al Qaeda guy in Rafadh, tomorrow you will have 700.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initially, Jifri said, the government refused to provide teachers, saying any town that was willing to accept help from Al Qaeda was beneath contempt. Finally, they relented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The government agreed to send 6 teachers,'' Jifri told me. ''Fahd brought 16.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHEN PEOPLE TALK about the government in Yemen, they really mean one man: Ali Abdullah Saleh. Despite the country's many political parties - Islamist, Socialist, Arab nationalist - the country is run almost entirely by Saleh, and he runs it exactly like a sheik: using his own tribe as a power base and constantly making deals to head off his rivals. Saleh came to power in 1978; pictures of him at the time show a skinny young man in a military cap that looks too big for him, his eyes covered by aviator sunglasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the time, most of Yemen was still just emerging from isolation. In 1962 a group of military officers, inspired and aided by Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, overthrew the xenophobic religious dynasty that, from its northern base, ruled much of Yemen for centuries. Some of the young officers hoped to modernize Yemen and make it more like other Arab countries. In the mid-1970s one Yemeni president, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, tried to tame the powerful tribal sheiks, extend the state's power throughout the country and unify with South Yemen, which emerged from British occupation in 1967. Yemeni intellectuals still talk about Hamdi with nostalgia. But the sheiks and their Saudi backers were not pleased. In October 1977, Hamdi was found riddled with bullets in his Sana home. The killers had thrown the bodies of murdered French prostitutes beside him to blacken his legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saleh was not a man to make such mistakes. He fought in a tribal army as a teenager and then made his way up through the ranks of the military, impressing superiors with his ruthlessness and charm. He became a tank commander - a crucial skill at a time when tanks were a new and essential weapon. When Hamdi's successor, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, was blown up by a bomb hidden in a briefcase, Saleh was a compromise replacement. No one expected him to last long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three decades later, Saleh retains a stiff, military bearing, with a strong jaw and glinting eyes. In person he conveys an impression of fierce pride and gruffness and the natural defensiveness of a man from a small tribe who fought his way up with no more than an elementary-school education. When I interviewed him in 2008, he seemed impatient and almost angry. His eyes darted around the room as he fired off commands to his aides in a guttural voice. He bridled at questions about the American role in Yemen. ''Arrogant,'' he said, staring at me, then adding disdainfully in English, ''Cowboys.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SOME SAY SALEH has lasted so long because, unlike his predecessors, he knew not to take on the tribes directly. ''Saleh survived by mastering the tribal game as no one else had,'' Khaled Fattah, the tribal expert, said. He did so in two ways. First, he coddled the big tribal sheiks, bringing them into the capital and building them large homes. He created a patronage network that grew substantially after Yemen began pumping oil in the 1980s, paying large sums to sheiks, military leaders, political figures and anyone who might pose a threat to his power. Much of Yemen's budget now goes into corruption and kickbacks - worth billions of dollars - that fuel this network, according to diplomats, analysts and oil-industry figures in Sana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, Saleh adopted what some Yemenis call ''the policy of management through conflicts.'' If a tribe was causing trouble, he would begin building up its rivals as a counterweight. If a political party became threatening, he would do the same thing, sometimes even creating a cloned version of the same party with people on the government payroll. ''The government plays divide and rule with us,'' Arfaj bin Hadban, a tribal sheik from Jawf province, north of Sana, said. ''If one tribe will not do what he wants, he gets the neighbors to pressure it. Sometimes it's money, sometimes it's weapons, sometimes it's employment for the tribesmen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in a sense, the key to Saleh's long rule - and to much of Yemen's modern history - lies just to the north in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom squats atop Yemen on the map like a domineering older brother with a rebellious sibling. Starting in 1962, the Saudi royal family viewed Yemenis' democratic aspirations with alarm and began paying hefty stipends to tribal sheiks throughout the country to reinforce its influence. Later, the Saudis began spreading their hard-line strand of Islam throughout the country, with help from some like-minded Yemenis. Hundreds of religious schools sprang up teaching Salafism, the puritanical sect that denounces all other sects as heresy. (The Saudi variant is usually called Wahhabism.) This was bound to be divisive in Yemen, where a third or more of the population were Zaydis, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the influence of the Salafists grew, Saleh formed close ties to jihadists and radical clerics like Abdul Majid al-Zindani, who is listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as a ''specially designated global terrorist.'' Saleh had a political motive: Salafists are mostly quiescent and preach obedience to the ruler (even if they call for violent jihad in other lands). That was an appealing trait in Yemen's complex social mosaic, where rivalries based on class, region, religious sect and lineage are endemic. But Saleh also knew that he needed the Saudis, who are widely believed to have arranged his accession in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I met him, Saleh seemed enraged that anyone should dare to criticize his methods. ''We have unified the country and brought stability,'' he told me. That is true. Saleh orchestrated the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, and he has remained in power for 32 years. But even as he spoke, in June 2008, those achievements seemed to be unraveling. Zaydi rebels from the north - angered by Saleh's support for the Salafists - were gaining ground. In the south, a groundswell of economic discontent was rising and later became an open secessionist movement. The fact that Saleh is now trying to arrange for his son Ahmed Saleh to succeed him as president has alienated many tribal leaders and other allies, narrowing Saleh's power base. In the past year, as Al Qaeda began to mount more frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he turned to some old friends for help, only to see them abandon him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One night in January 2009, Tareq al-Fadhli, a 42-year-old aristocrat from south Yemen, received a phone call from Saleh. Fadhli wasn't surprised: the Yemeni president is famously impulsive and has a habit of calling people late at night with urgent ideas or demands that are sometimes forgotten by daylight. But this one was unusual. Saleh wanted to convene all the old jihadis who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, Fadhli told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He wanted us to make a dialogue with the new generation of Al Qaeda,'' Fadhli said. ''He said he wanted to arrange to send them abroad to Saudi Arabia and Somalia, and in return he would release the ones who were in prison.'' The released prisoners would stay in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a bold idea, to put it mildly. Saudi Arabia is Yemen's most important ally and had waged bloody battles to rid itself of homegrown jihadi fighters. But Al Qaeda, once a manageable problem, seemed to be running out of control in Yemen, and America was putting on the pressure. Saleh was desperate to find a way to rid himself of the militants, preferably without calling in American airstrikes or doing anything else that would alienate the radical clerics on whose political support he counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fadhli, who has mournful eyes and a distinguished face, was a natural intermediary and an old ally. As a young man, he fought for three years in Afghanistan, leaving only after he was wounded at Jalalabad. He had formed a close friendship with Osama bin Laden, whom he still remembers fondly. Later, when the socialists of southern Yemen rebelled in 1994, Fadhli formed a brigade of jihadists at the central government's request and helped put down the rebels. His friend bin Laden helped out, providing millions of dollars' worth of arms and hundreds of fighters who were hungry for another chance to kill godless socialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After that, the former jihadis split. Fadhli, like many others, went back to civilian life, becoming a landowner in the south and an adviser to Saleh. He said goodbye to bin Laden in Sudan in 1994 and has not seen him since. But some veterans continued to preach jihad and to train in Afghanistan with Al Qaeda, which began to call for the overthrow of secular Arab regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first real sign that the jihadis were a source of trouble at home came in 2000 with the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in the Yemeni port town of Aden on the southern coast. Seventeen American sailors were killed. A year later, after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saleh recognized that a major shift had taken place. Fearing that the United States might invade Yemen, he flew to Washington and pledged his support. At home, his security forces rounded up hundreds of former jihadists and jailed them en masse without charge. In November 2002, the C.I.A. used a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill Abu Ali al-Harithi, then the leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, as he was driving in the desert east of Sana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saleh knew his collaboration with the United States could make the jihadis turn on him. He was furious after American officials leaked word of their role in the Harithi assassination. Later, Saleh repeatedly denied the Americans permission to kill Al Qaeda leaders during Yemen's 2006 presidential election because he feared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might harm his electoral prospects, according to one high-ranking Yemeni official. Saleh had struggled for years to find a compromise between the radicals and the Americans. He created an Islamic ''dialogue'' program to bring jihadists under the umbrella of the state, then abandoned it after several of its graduates returned to terrorism. Popular sympathy for the jihadist cause was still high, and in February 2006 Saleh suffered a deep embarrassment when 23 prisoners, many of them in Al Qaeda, escaped from a maximum-security prison in Sana. The authorities offered a preposterous explanation: the men tunneled out of their cell with spoons and table legs and emerged in the bathroom of a neighboring mosque. The truth, the high-ranking official told me, was that officers in the Political Security Organization arranged the escape. ''You have to remember, these officers used to escort people from Sana to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Afghan jihad,'' he said. ''People made relationships, and that doesn't change so easily.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 2007, it was clear that a new and more dangerous generation of Al Qaeda militants was emerging. Unlike their predecessors, these men aimed openly to overthrow the Yemeni state and refused all dialogue with it. Many later claimed that they suffered torture in Yemeni prisons during long terms - usually without formal charges. Some of them had gone to Iraq and returned with valuable battlefield skills. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grew bloodier and more frequent: a suicide bombing in July 2007 killed eight Spanish tourists; there were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on oil pipelines. In September 2008, suicide bombers in two cars struck the U.S. Embassy in Sana in a meticulously planned operation that left 10 Yemenis and all 6 attackers dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saleh tried to win the militants over through intermediaries. Nasser al-Bahri, a 35-year-old former driver for bin Laden, told me that he tried reaching out to the new militants. They refused, and he soon discovered he was on a ''death list'' of accused traitors. Several other former jihadists told me the same thing. ''I try to talk to these people,'' said Ali Muhammad al-Kurdi, another militant Islamist who fought in Afghanistan. ''They tell me, 'You are an agent.' '' Some of the older jihadists advised Saleh to immunize the state from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Islamizing it. He briefly deployed a morality-police brigade, modeled on the notorious cane-wielding mutawa in Saudi Arabia. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, in January of last year, Tareq al-Fadhli received his late-night phone call from the president. Saleh said he would release 130 Al Qaeda sympathizers right away as a good-will gesture and asked Fadhli to arrange the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fadhli told me that he formed a committee of former jihadis and began traveling through the areas where Al Qaeda has found sanctuary - Marib, Shabwa, Jawf and Abyan provinces. ''The tribal sheiks cooperated with us everywhere,'' Fadhli told me. ''Whenever we found Qaeda members, we told them: 'The government wants you to turn yourself in, but it's O.K. We will guarantee your safety.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, 20 people on the government's 60-most-wanted list agreed to stop fighting, Fadhli said. But the mediators never made any progress with Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch, or his top deputies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few months after the failed negotiation, in April 2009, Fadhli defected from the government, joining the southern secessionist movement. He told me that he was tired of hearing Saleh offer tempting deals to Al Qaeda while refusing to even talk to the leaders in the south, whose movement - rooted in claims of economic discrimination - is populist, secular and nonviolent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the United States grew increasingly concerned about Al Qaeda's growth in Yemen and about Saleh's tendency to see it as a family problem, solvable through dialogue. Veteran jihadists were said to be coming to Yemen from Afghanistan and Somalia. Last summer, Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the overall commander of American military forces in the Middle East, visited Sana, and the number of American military trainers working with Yemen's counterterrorism forces quietly grew. In the fall, a select group of American officials met with Saleh and showed him irrefutable evidence that Al Qaeda was aiming at him and his relatives, who dominate Yemen's military and intelligence services. That seems to have abruptly changed Saleh's attitude, American diplomats told me. The Yemenis began to mount more aggressive ground raids on Al Qaeda targets, in coordination with the airstrikes that began in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and raids were a short-term tactic. The real problem was that Yemen, with its mind-boggling corruption, its multiple insurgencies, its disappearing oil and water and its deepening poverty, is sure to descend further into chaos if something does not change. Everyone has acknowledged this, including President Obama and a growing chorus of terrorism analysts. So far, the calls for action have yielded nothing. I spoke to a number of American officials in Washington and to a variety of diplomats at the embassy in Sana. They all told me the same thing: no one has a real strategy for Yemen, in part because there are so few people who have any real expertise about the country. No American diplomats travel to the provinces where Al Qaeda has found sanctuary. Even the Yemeni government has great difficulty reaching these places; often they have no idea whether airstrikes or bombing runs have hit their targets, because they dare not show up to check until days afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officially, American policy in Yemen is twofold: using airstrikes and raids to help the Yemeni military knock out Al Qaeda cells, while increasing development and humanitarian aid to address the root causes of radicalism. In late June, the White House announced it was more than tripling its humanitarian assistance, to $42.5 million. But the numbers are still small given Yemen's need. And diplomats concede that they have not figured out how to address the central issues of poor governance, corruption and the economy. ''There is a huge amount of diplomacy that needs to be done and is not being done,'' Edmund J. Hull, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen from 2001 to 2004, said when I met him in Washington. ''It makes me uneasy to hear that we're not getting out to those remote areas. One way or another, we have ceded the initiative to Al Qaeda, and Al Qaeda is calling the shots.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AL QAEDA HAS a clear Yemen strategy. On Jan. 23, 2009, the group released a high-quality video clip on the Internet showing four men sitting on a floor, with a clean white curtain and a flag behind them. One of them was Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the group's leader, wearing a white turban, and one was Qassim al-Raymi, its military commander, clad in fatigues and a red-and-white kaffiyeh. Sitting alongside them were two new Qaeda commanders, both former detainees from the American prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video was a setback for President Obama, who had been inaugurated days earlier and had made a high-profile pledge to close Guantanamo - where nearly half the remaining inmates were Yemenis - within a year. But the real news was Al Qaeda's announcement that same month that it was merging its Saudi and Yemeni branches into a single unit: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The new group incorporated a number of fighters from Saudi Arabia, where the government had cracked down fiercely on terrorist networks. It proclaimed a broad ambition: to serve as a base for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> throughout the region and to replace the infidel governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia with a single theocratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of this new effort was an unlikely leader. Wuhayshi is a tiny man, less than five feet tall. In videotapes he sits motionless, his pinched face blank, his small eyes expressionless. Raymi, the group's burly military commander, speaks passionately, his hands knifing through the air, his eyes full of righteous anger. By contrast, Wuhayshi seems almost catatonic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Al Qaeda men treat him with deep veneration. ''When they see him, they kiss him on the forehead, like a great sheik,'' said Abdulelah Hider Shaea, a Yemeni journalist who interviewed Wuhayshi and other Al Qaeda leaders before the video's release. ''They all love and respect him.'' Shaea, who was blindfolded and driven out to a remote area for his interview, said Wuhayshi was laconic but quick-witted, with flashes of sarcastic humor and a remarkable ability to adduce Koranic verses to back up anything he said. Wuhayshi's authority seems to derive mostly from his long proximity to bin Laden, whom he served for six years as a private secretary in Afghanistan. ''During bombing raids, everyone else would scatter, but he would stay by bin Laden's side,'' Shaea said, echoing a story other Al Qaeda members told him about their leader. The founders seem to have been impressed: bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, issued a statement in November 2008 formally recognizing Wuhayshi as the emir, or prince, of Al Qaeda in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shaea and others who have studied him say Wuhayshi appears to be modeling himself on bin Laden, who has always been more cerebral guide than day-to-day commander. Wuhayshi left Afghanistan in late 2001 and was arrested by Iranian authorities; they handed him over two years later to Yemen, which jailed him without charge. Little is known about his early life in Abyan province in southern Yemen. Personality aside, he seems to have much in common with Raymi, his fiery military commander. Both men come from ordinary families, studied at religious schools and fought in Afghanistan, according to Shaea and other Yemeni journalists. Both served time afterward in Yemeni prisons. And both were among the 23 militants who escaped from the central Sana prison in February 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two men have also followed bin Laden's example in building an ever-more-sophisticated propaganda arm for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including frequent video and audio tapes and an Internet magazine, Sada al-Malahim (The Echo of Battles), that appears every two months or so. The magazine makes for bizarre reading, by turns chilling and poignant. The first page of one recent issue showed a colorful 1950s-style stock image of a hand that was mixing fluid in a chemical beaker, alongside a hand grenade and the headline ''Year of the Assassination.'' The authors are clearly familiar with the style of Western magazine journalism, and many articles are framed as regular features like View From the Inside and The Leader's Editorial. There are didactic items, with headlines like ''Shariah Is the Solution'' and ''Practical Steps Toward the Liberation of Palestine.'' But some of the articles are almost whimsical (''A Mujahid's Thoughts''), and there are sharp satires (''The Saudi Media on Mars''). Much of the content has an earnest, proselytizing tone, a bit like the ads that Western corporations publish to trumpet their civic responsibility. One recent article, for example, was titled ''Inside View: Why We're Fighting in the Arabian Peninsula.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since it first appeared in early 2008, the magazine has grown steadily more polished, and the quality of its Koranic scholarship has improved, said Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert at Princeton University who has spent years tracking Al Qaeda in the region. Its content has mirrored the influx of Saudi militants into the group, including Said Ali al-Shihri, a former Guantanamo detainee who is now the deputy emir of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Perhaps the magazine's most frequent target for abuse is Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, who directs Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism efforts and has become heavily involved with Yemen's struggle with Al Qaeda. In August, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula came close to assassinating bin Nayef when a Saudi suicide bomber posing as a repentant member of the group was allowed into the prince's Jedda home and detonated a bomb. Bin Nayef was only lightly injured. Afterward, Sada al-Malahim published a lengthy defense of the tactic under the headline ''War Is Deception,'' citing Koranic verses that approve of deceit as a tool in times of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The target audience for all this rhetoric is a bit of a mystery: Internet access is rare in Yemen, especially in the areas where Al Qaeda operates. There is evidence that the group may be aiming to win over members of the military or even the political elite (not an implausible goal, given the depth of sympathy for jihadism in Yemen). As for the broader public, one hint came in a video the group released last summer. The 18-minute video, ''The Battle of Marib,'' about a successful battle with the Yemeni military, pointedly emphasized the accuracy of Al Qaeda's casualty count. The narrator, Qassim al-Raymi, mocks the government for failing to acknowledge that seven soldiers were captured. The video then cuts to a government press conference, in which a spokesman stumbles badly in response to questions from journalists and refuses - just as Raymi said- to acknowledge the soldiers' capture. The video then returns to Raymi, who, facing the camera almost gloatingly, delivers his message: ''I call upon all Muslims to take their information from clear and correct sources, like the jihadi Web sites on the Internet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is far from clear how Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in remote and desperately underdeveloped areas, turns out such a slick product. Shaea, the Yemeni journalist who interviewed Al Qaeda's top leaders, told me he also met four members of the group's media arm in a room that was set up like a studio, with computers and other equipment. ''You could tell they were rich and well educated,'' he said. ''Some did not look like Arabs. They did not speak, so I wondered if they even spoke Arabic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Wuhayshi and Raymi want to recreate the original Al Qaeda in Yemen, they also seem to have learned from its mistakes. Starting in 2009, the group used its Internet magazine and intermittent videos to make increasingly passionate appeals to the people of Yemen - and especially to its tribes. The magazine echoed populist discontent about government corruption, unemployment and unfair distribution of revenue from Yemen's oil, much of which comes from the very areas where Al Qaeda is active. The articles often show a deep understanding of local concerns; one issue in 2008 included an anguished complaint about the government's mishandled response to a flood in the eastern province of Hadramawt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda's Afghanistan-based leadership reinforced the tribal message in early 2009, when Zawahiri issued an audiotape addressed to ''the noble and defiant tribes of Yemen,'' urging them to rise up against Saleh's government. ''Don't be less than your brothers in the defiant Pashtun and Baluch tribes,'' he said. ''Don't be helpers of Ali Abdullah Saleh. . . . Support your brothers the mujahedeen.'' At the same time, the group strove to marry members to tribal women and mediate tribal disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reason for all this was simple: a global reaction was developing against militants acting in the name of Al Qaeda, largely because of their extreme and often indiscriminate violence. In Iraq, the local Al Qaeda branch alienated tribes that provided crucial support for them in Anbar province, paving the way for the American-backed ''awakening movement'' that threw them out. Wuhayshi and his men clearly wanted to prevent that from happening in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far the most masterful piece of propaganda by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is still the ''Battle of Marib'' video. In it, Raymi tells the story of the Yemeni military's effort to destroy an Al Qaeda cell and capture Aidh al-Shabwani, a young militant with a lame leg whom one government official described to me as ''a sort of local Robin Hood figure.'' The raid was a humiliating failure. The army lost several tanks and armored vehicles to the guerrillas, who knew the local orange groves and deserts well. The Al Qaeda men took possession of a weapons convoy and captured seven soldiers, who were later released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video's most striking feature is its anxious plea to tribesmen to resist payments and pressure from the Yemeni government and its Saudi and American backers. It starts off with an acknowledgment that the raid took place because of a ''betrayal'' by local tribal leaders. Then Raymi intones: ''How shameful it is that some sheiks allow themselves to become soldiers and slaves of Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is himself but a slave to Saudi riyals and American dollars. I say to these sheiks: be careful that you don't become a piece of chewing gum that a person enjoys for a short time and then throws away.'' After Raymi and another narrator describe the Al Qaeda victory, the second narrator offers a more refined formulation, noting that the seven soldiers' lives were spared: ''If you don't support the mujahedeen, then at least don't stand against them.'' Since then, the group has released a stream of statements and videos outlining its basic objectives: to recruit more followers, overthrow Saleh and use Yemen as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Saudi monarchy and build an Islamic caliphate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AFTER THE DAWN cruise-missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Rafadh, the open-air tribal meeting reached a conclusion. The elders decided that Quso and his Al Qaeda gang had become a threat to the tribes. Two deadly missiles had struck in less than a week; more might be coming. Tribal hospitality was one thing, and it was a shame that the five young men were killed. But the presence of Quso and his recruits was endangering everyone. They had to go. The elders deputized Ahmed and a fellow tribesman to evict them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmed told me he sat in his pickup truck with Quso and spoke to him firmly: ''Are you satisfied? All of the people here have been living in the mountains, in the trees, for a week. Now we want you out, and don't come back unless you're alone.'' The Al Qaeda man said nothing. He seemed subdued and appeared to understand that he could not challenge the tribe's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmed drove Quso out of the valley on a bumpy dirt track. As they drove, Quso contacted other Al Qaeda members in the area, and they picked them up one by one. Before long there were 11 men piled into the truck. Ahmed said he left them on the nearest main road and returned to his valley. A few days later, Quso came back. This time he was alone. As of mid-February, he still was living alone in his grandfather's house, according to Jifri, who visited him there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not everyone has reacted to the airstrikes this way. In the neighboring province of Abyan, an airstrike killed dozens of people, most of them women and children, according to local witnesses. The civilian death toll created a groundswell of anger at the Yemeni government and the United States that was a boon to Al Qaeda recruiters, several local people told me. Ali al-Shal, an opposition member of the Yemeni Parliament who is from a village close to where the Abyan airstrikes took place, told me it was too dangerous for him to visit afterward. Ultimately he was able to visit, but only once and only by drawing on his family connections with local tribal figures. ''There was not much sympathy for Al Qaeda before, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has created a lot of sympathy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN RECENT WEEKS, Al Qaeda has sounded more confident than ever, issuing threats and calls to arms, along with publishing its Internet magazine and introducing an English-language online magazine called Inspire. In May, a botched air raid led to the death of a tribal leader in Marib who was negotiating on the government's behalf with a local Al Qaeda leader, infuriating the local tribes and further eroding President Saleh's credibility. On June 19, four heavily armed men stormed the fortified headquarters of the Political Security Organization in the southern port city of Aden, freeing prisoners suspected of being Al Qaeda members and escaping unharmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before leaving Yemen, I traveled to Aden. Near the dilapidated oil refinery built by the British, I found the Quso family home, in a row of simple stone and concrete bungalows. Fahd's father, Muhammad al-Quso, was just walking up to the door as I arrived. He was an old man with a deeply lined face, dressed in a red-and-white futa and headdress. He walked with a cane. Inside the house he sat down heavily in an armchair and told the story of his son's life. It was a biography that matched many others in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fahd was born in 1975, his father said, and grew up alongside four brothers and six sisters. He was a happy child and a good student at the local elementary school, called al-Saafir. But his parents wanted him to have some religion, so when he was 14 they sent him - along with some of his friends from the neighborhood - to a school up north called Dar al-Hadith. The school is famous as one of the first Wahhabi institutions in Yemen; John Walker Lindh was reportedly among the future jihadists who studied there. After he came home, he studied welding at the local technical school. But he decided not to work at the refinery, as his father had. When I asked about the accusations that his son took part in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 2000, he winced and said he didn't believe it. He complained that the authorities had jailed him, and then later, after freeing him, jailed his brother-in-law for no reason. Finally, I asked Muhammad whether his son was a member of Al Qaeda, as the authorities claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No,'' he said, ''I don't believe this.'' He was silent for a long time, staring at the closed door of the house, which was illuminated at its edges by a bright rectangle of afternoon sunlight. Then he spoke again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is a mujahid,'' he said, or holy warrior. ''He is fighting those who occupy Arab lands. He is fighting unbelievers.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEWS Three British men were found guilty in a London court of plotting to commit murder, in a case that centered on a 2006 conspiracy linked to Al Qaeda to blow up airliners bound for the United States and Canada. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS  The verdict followed the longest and costliest terrorism prosecution in British history, officials said, with 8 of the 10 defendants convicted over three trials. The bombing method the plotters chose -- injecting ingredients of liquid explosive into plastic soft-drink bottles using a syringe -- led to restrictions on the liquids and creams passengers could take on commercial flights. Those measures remain in force worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS The extradition of Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born Muslim cleric, from Britain to the United States, where he is wanted on terrorism charges, was delayed  after Europe's human rights court issued a stay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS The court said it wanted to examine whether American sentences were so long and prison conditions so harsh that they would violate Mr. Hamza's rights. He is serving a seven-year sentence in Britain for stirring racial hatred and inciting murder; the federal charges against him in the United States include allegations that he masterminded a terrorist ambush in 1998 against tourists, some of them Americans, in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS The Norwegian police arrested three men who they said made up ''one node'' of a terror network that plotted to bomb New York City's subway system and a shopping center in Manchester, England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS All three men -- a Uighur from China, an Iraqi Kurd and an Uzbek -- were legal immigrants to Norway, which is known for generous asylum policies and social services. Officials said they had ties to Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, had been under surveillance for a year and had begun to work on making explosives. The police said they decided to move in and arrest the men in part because The Associated Press had gotten wind of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS A day before Norwegian officials struck, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged a man they said was a senior Al Qaeda operative with involvement in those same plots and in other planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS Adnan G. el-Shukrijumah, a Saudi-born American citizen, is still at large. An elusive high-value target for the F.B.I., he was closely watched after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before vanishing about five years ago. A reward of up to $5 million is posted for information leading to his capture. Officials said he was part of a three-man group overseeing Al Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the West; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reportedly killed the other two men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS The European Parliament agreed to restart a program to track financial and bank transfers that the United States says is vital to fighting terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS The program, which one American official called ''a highly valuable counterterrorism tool'' that yielded hundreds of leads, was begun secretly after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Privacy concerns led the parliament to suspend it in February. European Union leaders agreed to resume the effort after winning assurances from the United States that European citizens would have recourse to American courts if they thought data about them was inaccurate or had been wrongly used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WARSAK, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The recent graduation ceremony here for Pakistani troops trained by Americans to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda was intended as show of fresh cooperation between the Pakistani and American militaries. But it said as much about its limitations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly 250 Pakistani paramilitary troops in khaki uniforms and green berets snapped to attention, with top students accepting a certificate from an American Army colonel after completing the specialized training for snipers and platoon and company leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this new center, 20 miles from the Afghanistan border, was built to train as many as 2,000 soldiers at a time. The largest component of the American-financed instruction -- a 10-week basic-training course -- is months behind schedule, officials from both sides acknowledge, in part because Pakistani commanders say they cannot afford to send troops for new training as fighting intensifies in the border areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also restricts the number of American trainers throughout the country to no more than about 120 Special Operations personnel, fearful of being identified too closely with the unpopular United States -- even though the Americans reimburse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more than $1 billion a year for its military operations in the border areas. ''We want to keep a low signature,'' said a senior Pakistani officer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deep suspicion that underlies every American move here is a fact of life that American officers say they must work through as they try to reverse the effects of the many years when the United States had cut </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> off from military aid because of its nuclear weapons program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That time of estrangement, which lasted through the 1990s, left the Pakistanis feeling scorned and abandoned by the United States, and its military distant and seeded with officers and soldiers sympathetic to conservative Islam -- and even at times the very militants they are today charged with fighting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today the American-led war in Afghanistan and its continuing campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas have made the United States suspect at all levels of the military, and among the Pakistani population, as anti-Americanism has hit new heights. This training program is among the first steps to repair that relationship. ''This is the most complex operating environment I've ever dealt with,'' said Col. Kurt Sonntag, a West Point graduate who handed out the graduation certificates here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such are the limits on the Americans that dozens of Pakistani enlisted ''master trainers,'' taught by the Americans, do the bulk of the hands-on instruction here. Since January 2009, about 1,000 scouts from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frontier Corps have completed the training, which is designed to help turn the 58,000-member paramilitary force that patrols the tribal areas from a largely passive border force into skilled and motivated fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The personnel training is just one piece of what is now a multipronged relationship. With combating Al Qaeda and the Taliban now the overriding priority, the United States provides </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a wide array of weapons, shares intelligence about the militants, and has given it more than $10 billion toward the cost of deploying nearly 150,000 troops in and around the border areas since 2001 -- with the promise of much more to come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 27, the United States delivered to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the first of three new F-16 jet fighters equipped with precision targeting instruments for day and night use. A half dozen United States Air Force pilots traveled here to train and qualify Pakistani aviators on night operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington is stressing that these upgraded fighters will be used by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the militants in the tribal areas, but they also augment the F-16 fleet that the United States has financed over the years as part of the country's arsenal that is directed against India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By urging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to embrace counterinsurgency training, the United States is trying to steer the Pakistani Army toward spending more resources against what Washington believes is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main enemy, the Taliban and Al Qaeda, rather than devoting almost the entire military effort against India, American officials said. Central to this approach is an array of training that the Americans tailor to what Pakistani says it needs for the Frontier Corps, its conventional army and its Special Operations forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About a dozen American trainers are assigned to yearlong duty at this training center, a cluster of classrooms and dormitories and adjacent training ranges on a large campus, which the United States spent $23 million to build, plus another $30 million for training and equipment requested by the Pakistani military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most gifted Frontier Corps marksmen are selected for sniper training, a skill in need against the Taliban who have been using Russian-made Dragonov sniper rifles to deadly effect against the Pakistani Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five two-man sniper teams, trained to use American-made M24 rifles as well as how to work with a spotter, measure wind speeds and camouflage their positions, received awards from Colonel Sonntag. But five two-man teams were dropped during the training because their math skills were not good enough, another American trainer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of the training here is aimed at building the confidence of the Frontier Corps scouts, some of whom have relatives in the Taliban, and who speak the same language, Pashto, as many militants. Often the militants are better armed and more handsomely paid than the scouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three basic skills were built into the course, one of the American trainers said: How to shoot straight, how to administer battlefield first aid, and how to provide covering fire for advancing troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until a few years ago, the Frontier Corps was widely ridiculed as corrupt and incompetent. But under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, salaries have quadrupled to about $200 a month, new equipment is flowing in, and the scouts are winning praise in combat. Still, General Khan acknowledged in an interview that the training here was still ''settling down and maturing.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The scouts face a  battle-hardened enemy that has lived in the mountains around here for decades. ''We've been here one-and-a-half years,'' said Col. Ahsan Raza, the training center's commandant. ''They have been preparing for the last 20 years.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army also conducts training on its own without direct American aid. At the Pabbi Hills training center, halfway between Islamabad and Lahore, a visitor drives up a rutted dirt road, past clusters of troop tents pitched amid acacia trees, to a sprawling, 2,500-acre series of ranges and obstacle courses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every Pakistani Army unit assigned to the fight in the country's tribal belt now receives at least four weeks of training in what the Pakistani Army calls ''low-intensity conflict.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atop a 30-foot-high observation tower that doubles as a rappelling wall, Maj. Shaukat Hayat, second in command of the 55 Baloch Regiment, a 700-man infantry unit, oversees as his troops drill in how to clear a militant's house. A billowing white smoke grenade offers advancing forces cover as they go room to room, exchanging gunfire with mock militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani trainer stands on a walkway above the roofless rooms that allows him to observe and grade the troops' performance. ''When they're done, they'll go back and review what they did, and do it again,'' said Major Hayat, 36. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The instructors are veterans of the campaigns in the tribal areas. Troops conduct live-fire drills on outdoor ranges with popup targets of militants. Similar drills at indoor ranges have paper targets with pictures of guerrillas and civilians, testing the troops' split-second skills to judge friend or foe under fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But simulating the fight with the militants goes only so far, Pakistani officers say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's good textbook training, but the final training has to take place on the ground and must deal with the idea of a bullet coming at you,'' said Lt. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON  --  Three men convicted last week of involvement in a 2006 plot to bomb trans-Atlantic airliners were sentenced in a London court on Monday to life imprisonment, with the judge telling them they would serve a minimum of 20 years for their roles as ''foot soldiers.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sentencing brought an end to an exhaustive court process that began in 2008   --  an initial trial and two retrials  -- and concluded a terrorism case that British officials have described as the longest, costliest and most serious  in the country's history. The plot detailed in court involved  suicide bombers who were to bring down at least seven airliners heading from London to the United States and Canada on a single day with explosions created by mixing liquids carried aboard in plastic soft-drink bottles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In all, eight men were sentenced to life terms for their roles in a scheme that prosecutors said could have taken  2,000 lives, and possibly many more. Evidence not presented at trial because of a ban on intercept evidence in British courts showed that the plotters were caught by electronic bugs discussing the recruitment of as many as  18 suicide bombers. When arrested, the plot's ringleader in Britain, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, was carrying a computer memory device listing seven flights earmarked for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers for the three men sentenced on Monday  --  Arafat Waheed Khan, 29; Ibrahim Savant, 29; and Waheed Zaman, 26  --  told the Woolwich Crown Court  in south London that they had been led into terrorism, and had their Muslim faith corrupted, by Mr. Ali, 29, a computer engineer, who had known two of the three men since they were at school together in east London. Mr.  Ali is  serving a life sentence in the case, as are four other men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge, Sir Timothy Holroyde,  said he accepted that the three men were recruited by Mr. Ali, whom he called ''a very powerful personality.'' But he noted their full participation in the plot, telling them that each of them had planned ''to kill members of the general public and yourselves by acting as a suicide bomber'' and had recorded ''martyrdom videos'' in which they had spoken of themselves as ''blessed by the opportunity to take part in that mission.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In this dreadful conspiracy, the intended role of the foot soldier was to blow himself up and to kill and maim an uncertain but potentially large number of men, women and children,'' the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intercepts of telephone and e-mail traffic between the plotters and contacts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> linked to Al Qaeda were crucial to uncovering the plot, and provided Scotland Yard with leads that led to a surveillance operation in Britain that kept the plotters under observation for several months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the case ended up causing deep strains between British and American terrorism investigators.  Scotland Yard blamed the Americans for the premature arrest in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of  a British man regarded as the plot's mastermind, Rashid Rauf. That arrest  forced a hasty roundup of the remaining suspects in August 2006 that British investigators said weakened the case against the men at the ensuing trials. Mr. Rauf escaped from Pakistani custody in December 2007, but was reported by American and Pakistani officials to have been killed in an area along </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border with Afghanistan 11 months later by a missile fired from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A first trial in London ended with none of the eight defendants convicted of the principal charge of plotting to blow up airliners. A second trial led to three of the men, including Mr. Ali, being convicted on that charge, and two others on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder. At the third trial, the three men sentenced on Monday were found guilty of the same charge. All eight men received life terms, and four other men over the course of the trials were convicted of lesser offenses related to the plot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The new American military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, is pushing to have top leaders of a feared insurgent group designated as terrorists, a move that could complicate an eventual Afghan political settlement with the Taliban and aggravate political tensions in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Petraeus introduced the idea of blacklisting the group, known as the Haqqani network, late last week in discussions with President Obama's senior advisers on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, according to several administration officials, who said it was being seriously considered. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a move could risk antagonizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a critical partner in the war effort, but one that is closely tied to the Haqqani network. It could also frustrate the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who is pressing to reconcile with all the insurgent groups as a way to end the nine-year-old war and consolidate his own grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case of the Haqqani network, run by an old warlord family, underscores the thorny decisions that will have to be made over which Taliban-linked insurgents should win some sort of amnesty and play a role in the future of Afghanistan. Mr. Karzai has already petitioned the United Nationsto lift sanctions against dozens of members of the Taliban, and has won conditional support from the Obama administration, so long as these people sever ties to Al Qaeda, forswear violence and accept the Afghan Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If they are willing to accept the red lines and come in from the cold, there has to be a place for them,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said to reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From its base in the frontier area near the border of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, the network of Sirajuddin Haqqani is suspected of running much of the insurgency around Kabul, the Afghan capital, and across eastern Afghanistan, carrying out car bombings and kidnappings, including spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American military installations. It is allied with Al Qaeda and with leaders of the Afghan Taliban branch under Mullah Muhammad Omar, now based near Quetta, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the group's real power may lie in its deep connections to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, which analysts say sees the Haqqani network as a way to exercise its own leverage in Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders have recently offered to broker talks between Mr. Karzai and the network, officials said, arguing that it could be a viable future partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials remain extremely skeptical that the Haqqani network's senior leaders could ever be reconciled with the Afghan government, although they say perhaps some midlevel commanders and foot soldiers could. Some officials in Washington and in the region expressed concerns that imposing sanctions on the entire network might drive away some fighters who might be persuaded to lay down their arms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The idea of putting the Haqqani network on a blacklist was first made public on Tuesday by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who has just returned from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Mr. Levin did not disclose any conversations he might have had with General Petraeus on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Haqqani network is perhaps the most significant threat to stability in Afghanistan, said Mr. Levin, a powerful voice in Congress on military affairs as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Levin also advocated increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the organization by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and by the United States, using unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At the moment, the Haqqani network -- and their fighters coming over the border from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan -- is the greatest threat, at least external threat, to Afghanistan,'' Mr. Levin said at a morning breakfast with correspondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''More needs to be done by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he added. ''The Pakistanis have said they now realize, more than ever, that terrorism is a threat to them -- not just the terrorists who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> them directly, but the terrorists who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> others from their territory.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Placement on the State Department's list would mainly impose legal limits on American citizens and companies, prohibiting trade with the Haqqani network or its leaders and requiring that banks freeze their assets in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Levin noted that the law would also require the United States government to apply pressure on any nation harboring such a group, in this case </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Kabul, a spokesman for General Petraeus said he would not comment on any internal discussions. But in public General Petraeus has expressed alarm about the network and has talked about his desire to see the Pakistani military act more aggressively against the group's stronghold in the North Waziristan region of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In testimony before Mr. Levin's committee last month, General Petraeus said he viewed the network as a particular danger to the mission in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he and other senior military officers had shared information with their counterparts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that showed the Haqqani network ''clearly commanded and controlled'' recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kabul and against the Bagram Air Base outside Kabul, which is controlled by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The focus on a political settlement is likely to intensify next week at a conference in Kabul, to be headed by Mr. Karzai and attended by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other officials. Mr. Karzai recently signed a decree authorizing the reintegration of lower-level Taliban fighters, and Mr. Holbrooke said the meeting would kick off that program, which will be financed by $180 million from Japan, Britain and other countries, as well as $100 million in Pentagon funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Karzai is eager to extend an olive branch to higher-level figures as well. His government wants to remove up to 50 of the 137 Taliban names on the United Nations Security Council's blacklist. Mr. Holbrooke, the special envoy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, said the administration supported efforts to cull the list, but would approve names only on a case-by-case basis. Certain figures, like Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, remain out of bounds, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For its part, the United States is trying to keep the emphasis on the low-level fighters, rather than the leadership. The planned American military campaign in Kandahar, officials said, could weaken the position of Taliban leaders, making them more amenable to a settlement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the United States backs ''Afghan-led reconciliation,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. And he said the administration was encouraged by recent meetings between Mr. Karzai and Pakistani leaders, which he said were slowly building trust between these often-suspicious neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nothing could be more important to the resolution of the war in Afghanistan,'' he said, ''than a common understanding between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on what their strategic purpose is.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The last time Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, less than a year ago, she was asked when the United States would stop killing innocent civilians in its covert </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She, in turn, suggested that officials in the Pakistani government knew where Al Qaeda's leaders were hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood was noticeably less toxic on Monday, perhaps in part because Mrs. Clinton showed up with more than $500 million in economic aid, part of her campaign to win over a skeptical Pakistani public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Pakistani attitudes toward America has become one of Mrs. Clinton's personal challenges as secretary of state. She and her advisers seized on the less hostile reception given to her on this visit, compared with October, to assert that her public diplomacy was making a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I could feel a change,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters as she flew from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Afghanistan at the end of the two-day visit. ''The government officials also believe we are moving the needle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she also expressed caution about overstating progress with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Of course there is a legacy of suspicion that we inherited,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''It is not going to be eliminated overnight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was certainly some cognitive dissonance in Mrs. Clinton's encounters with Pakistanis. At a town-hall meeting, she told a businessman that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> record of proliferation would make it hard for the United States to sell it nuclear technology. In a later round table with television journalists, she prodded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to stiffen its fight against Islamic militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islamabad, she said, could do more to help the United States capture or kill Al Qaeda's leaders. ''I believe they are here in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and it would be really helpful if we could get them,'' she said in the interview, which was lively, but not as contentious as her last one here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the business executive pressed Mrs. Clinton about why United States had not offered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the kind of civilian nuclear energy pact it has with India, she reminded him of the father of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who sold nuclear secrets to Libya and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The problems with Mr. A. Q. Khan raise red flags with people around the world,'' she said. ''They cannot be overlooked or put under the carpet.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she said, was also resisting a treaty to curb the spread of nuclear fuel and had not explained its purchase of two reactors from China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to judge, based on a single meeting and an interview, whether Mrs. Clinton had changed many minds. The participants in the town-hall meeting were invited by the American Embassy in Islamabad; officials said many had worked with American diplomats. Most public opinion polls here show that Pakistanis remain deeply suspicious of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Najam Sethi, a prominent Pakistani editor and commentator, said Mrs. Clinton would have determined a better sense of her progress had she ventured to Lahore, the Punjabi city she visited last fall, where university students gave her a stony reception. The mass-market papers in Lahore and Karachi, he said, were powerful motors of anti-American sentiment in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, Mr. Sethi said, many Pakistanis had soured on the United States all over again because they had not seen any benefits from $7.5 billion in economic aid approved by Congress last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton tried to make up for that on Monday, introducing programs to renovate hospitals, rebuild hydroelectric dams, improve water distribution and help farmers export mangoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, her audiences this time seemed far more interested in talking about everyday problems, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> frequent power failures, than the threat of radical Islam. But with Mrs. Clinton headed to a major conference in Kabul on Tuesday, the topic of Afghanistan's future came up, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton offered guarded support for negotiations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based insurgent groups, like the Haqqani network. But she cautioned both Afghans and Pakistanis to enter any such talks warily, since groups like the Haqqani network were unlikely to meet the minimum American requirements to be reconciled with Afghan society: severing ties with Al Qaeda, renouncing violence and abiding by the Afghan Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton confirmed that the United States was moving toward putting the Haqqani network on its list of terrorist groups. But she said that should not necessarily rule out Afghan efforts to reconcile with it. ''There is no contradiction between trying to defeat those who are determined to fight and opening the door to those who are willing to reconcile,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans fighting the war in Afghanistan have long harbored strong suspicions that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military spy service has guided the Afghan insurgency with a hidden hand, even as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> receives more than $1 billion a year from Washington for its help combating the militants, according to a trove of secret military field reports made public Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents, made available by an organization called WikiLeaks, suggest that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an ostensible ally of the United States, allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, the reports indicate that American soldiers on the ground are inundated with accounts of a network of Pakistani assets and collaborators that runs from the Pakistani tribal belt along the Afghan border, through southern Afghanistan, and all the way to the capital, Kabul.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the information -- raw intelligence and threat assessments gathered from the field in Afghanistan-- cannot be verified and likely comes from sources aligned with Afghan intelligence, which considers </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an enemy, and paid informants. Some describe plots for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that do not appear to have taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many of the reports rely on sources that the military rated as reliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While current and former American officials interviewed could not corroborate individual reports, they said that the portrait of the spy agency's collaboration with the Afghan insurgency was broadly consistent with other classified intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the reports describe Pakistani intelligence working alongside Al Qaeda to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts cautioned that although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militant groups and Al Qaeda work together, directly linking the Pakistani spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, with Al Qaeda is difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records also contain firsthand accounts of American anger at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unwillingness to confront insurgents who launched </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near Pakistani border posts, moved openly by the truckload across the frontier, and retreated to Pakistani territory for safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The behind-the-scenes frustrations of soldiers on the ground and glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an ally by American officials, looking to sustain a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign over parts of Pakistani territory to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Qaeda havens. Administration officials also want to keep nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on their side to safeguard NATO supplies flowing on routes that cross </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in one of the frequent visits by American officials to Islamabad, announced $500 million in assistance and called the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''partners joined in common cause.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports suggest, however, that the Pakistani military has acted as both ally and enemy, as its spy agency runs what American officials have long suspected is a double game -- appeasing certain American demands for cooperation while angling to exert influence in Afghanistan through many of the same insurgent networks that the Americans are fighting to eliminate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, both Bush and Obama administration officials as well as top American commanders have confronted top Pakistani military officers with accusations of ISI complicity in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan, and even presented top Pakistani officials with lists of ISI and military operatives believed to be working with militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been an important ally in the battle against militant groups, and that Pakistani soldiers and intelligence officials had worked alongside the United States to capture or kill Qaeda and Taliban leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he said that the ''status quo is not acceptable,'' and that the havens for militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''pose an intolerable threat'' that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must do more to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Pakistani government -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence services -- must continue their strategic shift against violent extremist groups within their borders,'' he said. American military support to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would continue, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Congressional officials said that despite repeated requests over the years for information about Pakistani support for militant groups, they usually receive vague and inconclusive briefings from the Pentagon and C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, senior lawmakers say they have no doubt that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is aiding insurgent groups. ''The burden of proof is on the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the ISI to show they don't have ongoing contacts,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee who visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this month and said he and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the committee chairman, confronted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, yet again over the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such accusations are usually met with angry denials, particularly by the Pakistani military, which insists that the ISI severed its remaining ties to the groups years ago. An ISI spokesman in Islamabad said Sunday that the agency would have no comment until it saw the documents. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said, ''The documents circulated by WikiLeaks do not reflect the current on-ground realities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man the United States has depended on for cooperation in fighting the militants and who holds most power in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the head of the army, Gen. Parvez Ashfaq Kayani, ran the ISI from 2004 to 2007, a period from which many of the reports are drawn. American officials have frequently praised General Kayani for what they say are his efforts to purge the military of officers with ties to militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials have described </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy service as a rigidly hierarchical organization that has little tolerance for ''rogue'' activity. But Pakistani military officials give the spy service's ''S Wing'' -- which runs external operations against the Afghan government and India -- broad autonomy, a buffer that allows top military officials deniability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials have rarely uncovered definitive evidence of direct ISI involvement in a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in July 2008, the C.I.A.'s deputy director, Stephen R. Kappes, confronted Pakistani officials with evidence that the ISI helped plan the deadly suicide bombing of India's Embassy in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the current trove, one report shows that Polish intelligence warned of a complex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Indian Embassy a week before that bombing, though the attackers and their methods differed. The ISI was not named in the report warning of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another, dated August 2008, identifies a colonel in the ISI plotting with a Taliban official to assassinate President Hamid Karzai. The report says there was no information about how or when this would be carried out. The account could not be verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Linked to Militants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul ran the ISI from 1987 to 1989, a time when Pakistani spies and the C.I.A. joined forces to run guns and money to Afghan militias who were battling Soviet troops in Afghanistan. After the fighting stopped, he maintained his contacts with the former mujahedeen, who would eventually transform themselves into the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And more than two decades later, it appears that General Gul is still at work. The documents indicate that he has worked tirelessly to reactivate his old networks, employing familiar allies like Jaluluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose networks of thousands of fighters are responsible for waves of violence in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Gul is mentioned so many times in the reports, if they are to be believed, that it seems unlikely that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> current military and intelligence officials could not know of at least some of his wide-ranging activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, one intelligence report describes him meeting with a group of militants in Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, in January 2009. There, he met with three senior Afghan insurgent commanders and three ''older'' Arab men, presumably representatives of Al Qaeda, who the report suggests were important ''because they had a large security contingent with them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering was designed to hatch a plan to avenge the death of ''Zamarai,'' the nom de guerre of Osama al-Kini, who had been killed days earlier by a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kini had directed Qaeda operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and had spearheaded some of the group's most devastating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plot hatched in Wana that day, according to the report, involved driving a dark blue Mazda truck rigged with explosives from South Waziristan to Afghanistan's Paktika Province, a route well known to be used by the insurgents to move weapons, suicide bombers and fighters from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a show of strength, the Taliban leaders approved a plan to send 50 Arab and 50 Waziri fighters to Ghazni Province in Afghanistan, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Gul urged the Taliban commanders to focus their operations inside Afghanistan in exchange for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turning ''a blind eye'' to their presence in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. It was unclear whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was ever executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has pushed the United Nations to put General Gul on a list of international terrorists, and top American officials said they believed he was an important link between active-duty Pakistani officers and militant groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Gul, who says he is retired and lives on his pension, dismissed the allegations as ''absolute nonsense,'' speaking by telephone from his home in Rawalpindi, where the Pakistani Army keeps its headquarters. ''I have had no hand in it.'' He added, ''American intelligence is pulling cotton wool over your eyes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Pakistani officials consistently deny that General Gul still works at the ISI's behest, though several years ago, after mounting American complaints, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, was forced publicly to acknowledge the possibility that former ISI officials were assisting the Afghan insurgency. Despite his denials, General Gul keeps close ties to his former employers. When a reporter visited General Gul this spring for an interview at his home, the former spy master canceled the appointment. According to his son, he had to attend meetings at army headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suicide Bomber Network</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports also chronicle efforts by ISI officers to run the networks of suicide bombers that emerged as a sudden, terrible force in Afghanistan in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detailed reports indicate that American officials had a relatively clear understanding of how the suicide networks presumably functioned, even if some of the threats did not materialize. It is impossible to know why the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never came off -- either they were thwarted, the attackers shifted targets, or the reports were deliberately planted as Taliban disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One report, from Dec. 18, 2006, describes a cyclical process to develop the suicide bombers. First, the suicide attacker is recruited and trained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Then, reconnaissance and operational planning gets under way, including scouting to find a place for ''hosting'' the suicide bomber near the target before carrying out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The network, it says, receives help from the Afghan police and the Ministry of Interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, the reports are complete with names and ages of bombers, as well as license plate numbers, but the Americans gathering the intelligence struggle to accurately portray many other details, introducing sometimes comical renderings of places and Taliban commanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, a report rated by the American military as credible states that a gray Toyota Corolla had been loaded with explosives between the Afghan border and Landik Hotel, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, apparently a mangled reference to Landi Kotal, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. The target of the plot, however, is a real hotel in downtown Kabul, the Ariana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is likely that ISI may be involved as supporter of this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' reads a comment in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the reports describe current and former ISI operatives, including General Gul, visiting madrasas near the city of Peshawar, a gateway to the tribal areas, to recruit new fodder for suicide bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One report, labeled a ''real threat warning'' because of its detail and the reliability of its source, described how commanders of Mr. Hekmatyar's insurgent group, Hezb-i-Islami, ordered the delivery of a suicide bomber from the Hashimiye madrasa, run by Afghans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy was to be used in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American or NATO vehicles in Kabul during the Muslim Festival of Sacrifices that opened Dec. 31, 2006. According to the report, the boy was taken to the Afghan city of Jalalabad to buy a car for the bombing, and was later brought to Kabul. It was unclear whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents indicate that these types of activities continued throughout last year. From July to October 2009, nine threat reports detailed movements by suicide bombers from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into populated areas of Afghanistan, including Kandahar, Kunduz and Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the bombers were sent to disrupt Afghanistan's presidential elections, held last August. In other instances, American intelligence learned that the Haqqani network sent bombers at the ISI's behest to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indian officials, development workers and engineers in Afghanistan. Other plots were aimed at the Afghan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes the intelligence documents twin seemingly credible detail with plots that seem fantastical or utterly implausible assertions. For instance, one report describes an ISI plan to use a remote-controlled bomb disguised as a golden Koran to assassinate Afghan government officials. Another report documents an alleged plot by the ISI and Taliban to ship poisoned alcoholic beverages to Afghanistan to kill American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the reports also charge that the ISI directly helped organize Taliban offensives at key junctures of the war. On June 19, 2006, ISI operatives allegedly met with the Taliban leaders in Quetta, the city in southern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where American and other Western officials have long believed top Taliban leaders have been given refuge by the Pakistani authorities. At the meeting, according to the report, they pressed the Taliban to mount </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Maruf, a district of Kandahar that lies along the Pakistani border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned offensive would be carried out primarily by Arabs and Pakistanis, the report said, and a Taliban commander, ''Akhtar Mansoor,'' warned that the men should be prepared for heavy losses. ''The foreigners agreed to this operation and have assembled 20 4x4 trucks to carry the fighters into areas in question,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the specifics about the foreign fighters and the ISI are difficult to verify, the Taliban did indeed mount an offensive to seize control in Maruf in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan government officials and Taliban fighters have widely acknowledged that the offensive was led by the Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, who was then the Taliban shadow governor of Kandahar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mullah Mansour tried to claw out a base for himself inside Afghanistan, but just as the report quotes him predicting, the Taliban suffered heavy losses and eventually pulled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report goes on to describe detailed plans for a large-scale assault, timed for September 2007, aimed at the American forward operating base in Managi, in Kunar Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It will be a five-pronged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consisting of 83-millimeter artillery, rockets, foot soldiers, and multiple suicide bombers,'' it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ever came off, but its planning foreshadowed another, seminal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that came months later, in July 2008. At that time, about 200 Taliban insurgents nearly overran an American base in Wanat, in Nuristan, killing nine American soldiers. For the Americans, it was one of the highest single-day tolls of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flood of reports of Pakistani complicity in the insurgency has at times led to barely disguised tensions between American and Pakistani officers on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings at border outposts set up to develop common strategies to seal the frontier and disrupt Taliban movements reveal deep distrust among the Americans of their Pakistani counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 7, 2007, American officers met with Pakistani troops on a dry riverbed to discuss the borderlands surrounding Afghanistan's Khost Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to notes from the meeting, the Pakistanis portrayed their soldiers as conducting around-the-clock patrols. Asked if he expected a violent spring, a man identified in the report as Lt. Col. Bilal, the Pakistani officer in charge, said no. His troops were in firm control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans were incredulous. Their record noted that there had been a 300 percent increase in militant activity in Khost before the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This comment alone shows how disconnected this particular group of leadership is from what is going on in reality,'' the notes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistanis told the Americans to contact them if they spotted insurgent activity along the border. ''I doubt this would do any good,'' the American author of the report wrote, ''because PAKMIL/ISI is likely involved with the border crossings.'' ''PAKMIL'' refers to the Pakistani military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year earlier, the Americans became so frustrated at the increase in roadside bombs in Afghanistan that they hand-delivered folders with names, locations, aerial photographs and map coordinates to help the Pakistani military hunt down the militants the Americans believed were responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing happened, wrote Col. Barry Shapiro, an American military liaison officer with experience in both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, after an Oct. 13, 2006, meeting. ''Despite the number of reports and information detailing the concerns,'' Colonel Shapiro wrote, ''we continue to see no change in the cross-border activity and continue to see little to no initiative along the PAK border'' by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> troops. The Pakistani Army ''will only react when asked to do so by U.S. forces,'' he concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article was written and reported by C. J. Chivers, Carlotta Gall, Andrew W. Lehren, Mark Mazzetti, Jane Perlez, and Eric Schmitt, with contributions from Jacob Harris and Alan McLean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-year archive of classified military documents made public on Sunday offers an unvarnished, ground-level picture of the war in Afghanistan that is in many respects more grim than the official portrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secret documents, released on the Internet by an organization called WikiLeaks, are a daily diary of an American-led force often starved for resources and attention as it struggled against an insurgency that grew larger, better coordinated and more deadly each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times, the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel were given access to the voluminous records several weeks ago on the condition that they not report on the material before Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents -- some 92,000 reports spanning parts of two administrations from January 2004 through December 2009 -- illustrate in mosaic detail why, after the United States has spent almost $300 billion on the war in Afghanistan, the Taliban are stronger than at any time since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the new American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, tries to reverse the lagging war effort, the documents sketch a war hamstrung by an Afghan government, police force and army of questionable loyalty and competence, and by a Pakistani military that appears at best uncooperative and at worst to work from the shadows as an unspoken ally of the very insurgent forces the American-led coalition is trying to defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material comes to light as Congress and the public grow increasingly skeptical of the deepening involvement in Afghanistan and its chances for success as next year's deadline to begin withdrawing troops looms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archive is a vivid reminder that the Afghan conflict until recently was a second-class war, with money, troops and attention lavished on Iraq while soldiers and Marines lamented that the Afghans they were training were not being paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports -- usually spare summaries but sometimes detailed narratives -- shed light on some elements of the war that have been largely hidden from the public eye:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban have used portable heat-seeking missiles against allied aircraft, a fact that has not been publicly disclosed by the military. This type of weapon helped the Afghan mujahedeen defeat the Soviet occupation in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secret commando units like Task Force 373 -- a classified group of Army and Navy special operatives -- work from a ''capture/kill list'' of about 70 top insurgent commanders. These missions, which have been stepped up under the Obama administration, claim notable successes, but have sometimes gone wrong, killing civilians and stoking Afghan resentment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military employs more and more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to survey the battlefield and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets in Afghanistan, although their performance is less impressive than officially portrayed. Some crash or collide, forcing American troops to undertake risky retrieval missions before the Taliban can claim the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Intelligence Agency has expanded paramilitary operations inside Afghanistan. The units launch ambushes, order airstrikes and conduct night raids. From 2001 to 2008, the C.I.A. paid the budget of Afghanistan's spy agency and ran it as a virtual subsidiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, the documents do not contradict official accounts of the war. But in some cases the documents show that the American military made misleading public statements -- attributing the downing of a helicopter to conventional weapons instead of heat-seeking missiles or giving Afghans credit for missions carried out by Special Operations commandos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials vigorously denied that the Obama administration had presented a misleading portrait of the war in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''On Dec. 1, 2009, President Obama announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan, and increased focus on Al Qaeda and Taliban safe-havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, precisely because of the grave situation that had developed over several years,'' said Gen. James L. Jones, White House national security adviser, in a statement released Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We know that serious challenges lie ahead, but if Afghanistan is permitted to slide backwards, we will again face a threat from violent extremist groups like Al Qaeda who will have more space to plot and train,'' the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Jones also decried the decision by WikiLeaks to make the documents public, saying that the United States ''strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk, and threaten our national security.''''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''WikiLeaks made no effort to contact us about these documents the United States government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted,'' General Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archive is clearly an incomplete record of the war. It is missing many references to seminal events and does not include more highly classified information. The documents also do not cover events in 2010, when the influx of more troops into Afghanistan began and a new counterinsurgency strategy took hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They suggest that the military's internal assessments of the prospects for winning over the Afghan public, especially in the early days, were often optimistic, even naive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fleeting -- even taunting -- reminders of how the war began in the occasional references to the elusive Osama bin Laden. In some reports he is said to be attending meetings in Quetta, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His money man is said to be flying from Iran to North Korea to buy weapons. Mr. bin Laden has supposedly ordered a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. These reports all seem secondhand at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports portray a resilient, canny insurgency that has bled American forces through a war of small cuts. The insurgents set the war's pace, usually fighting on ground of their own choosing and then slipping away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabotage and trickery have been weapons every bit as potent as small arms, mortars or suicide bombers. So has Taliban intimidation of Afghan officials and civilians -- applied with pinpoint pressure through threats, charm, violence, money, religious fervor and populist appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEB. 19, 2008 ZABUL PROVINCEIntelligence Summary: Officer Threatened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afghan National Army brigade commander working in southern Afghanistan received a phone call from a Taliban mullah named Ezat, one brief report said. ''Mullah Ezat told the ANA CDR to surrender and offered him $100,000(US) to quit working for the Afghan Army,'' the report said. ''Ezat also stated that he knows where the ANA CDR is from and knows his family.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAY 9, 2009 KUNAR PROVINCEIntelligence Summary: Taliban Recruiter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Taliban commander, Mullah Juma Khan, delivered a eulogy at the funeral of a slain insurgent. He played on the crowd's emotions, according to the report: ''Juma cried while telling the people an unnamed woman and her baby were killed while the woman was nursing the baby.'' Finally he made his pitch: ''Juma then told the people they needed to be angry at CF [Coalition Force] and ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] for causing this tragedy'' and ''invited everyone who wants to fight to join the fighters who traveled with him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurgents use a network of spies, double agents, collaborators and informers -- anything to undercut coalition forces and the effort to build a credible and effective Afghan government capable of delivering security and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports repeatedly describe instances when the insurgents have been seen wearing government uniforms, and other times when they have roamed the country or appeared for battle in the very Ford Ranger pickup trucks that the United States had provided the Afghan Army and police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOV. 20, 2006 KABULIncident Report: Insurgent Subterfuge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After capturing four pickup trucks from the Afghan National Army, the Taliban took them to Kabul to be used in suicide bombings. ''They intend to use the pick-up trucks to target ANA compounds, ISAF and GOA convoys, as well as ranking GOA and ISAF officials,'' said a report, referring to coalition forces and the government of Afghanistan. ''The four trucks were also accompanied by an unknown quantity of ANA uniforms to facilitate carrying out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban's use of heat-seeking missiles has not been publicly disclosed -- indeed, the military has issued statements that these internal records contradict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the form known as a Stinger, such weapons were provided to a previous generation of Afghan insurgents by the United States, and helped drive out the Soviets. The reports suggest that the Taliban's use of these missiles has been neither common nor especially effective; usually the missiles missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAY 30, 2007 HELMAND PROVINCEIncident Report: Downed Helicopter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American CH-47 transport helicopter was struck by what witnesses described as a portable heat-seeking surface-to-air missile after taking off from a landing zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopter, the initial report said, ''was engaged and struck with a Missile ... shortly after crossing over the Helmand River. The missile struck the aircraft in the left engine. The impact of the missile projected the aft end of the aircraft up as it burst into flames followed immediately by a nose dive into the crash site with no survivors.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash killed seven soldiers: five Americans, a Briton and a Canadian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple witnesses saw a smoke trail behind the missile as it rushed toward the helicopter. The smoke trail was an important indicator. Rocket-propelled grenades do not leave them. Heat-seeking missiles do. The crew of other helicopters reported the downing as a surface-to-air missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that was not what a NATO spokesman told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Clearly, there were enemy fighters in the area,'' said the spokesman, Maj. John Thomas. ''It's not impossible for small-arms fire to bring down a helicopter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports paint a disheartening picture of the Afghan police and soldiers at the center of the American exit strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon is spending billions to train the Afghan forces to secure the country. But the police have proved to be an especially risky investment and are often described as distrusted, even loathed, by Afghan civilians. The reports recount episodes of police brutality, corruption petty and large, extortion and kidnapping. Some police officers defect to the Taliban. Others are accused of collaborating with insurgents, arms smugglers and highway bandits. Afghan police officers defect with trucks or weapons, items captured during successful ambushes or raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARCH 10, 2008 PAKTIA PROVINCEInvestigation Report: Extortion by the Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report captured the circular and frustrating effort by an American investigator to stop Afghan police officers at a checkpoint from extorting payments from motorists. After a line of drivers described how they were pressed to pay bribes, the American investigator and the local police detained the accused checkpoint police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While waiting,'' the investigator wrote, ''I asked the seven patrolmen we detained to sit and relax while we sorted through a problem without ever mentioning why they were being detained. Three of the patrolmen responded by saying that they had only taken money from the truck drivers to buy fuel for their generator.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later when the American followed up, he was told by police officers that the case had been dropped because the witness reports had all been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One report documented the detention of a military base worker trying to leave the base with GPS units hidden under his clothes and taped to his leg. Another described the case of a police chief in Zurmat, in Paktia Province, who was accused of falsely reporting that his officers had been in a firefight so he could receive thousands of rounds of new ammunition, which he sold in a bazaar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coalition trainers report that episodes of cruelty by the Afghan police undermine the effort to build a credible security force to take over when the allies leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCT. 11, 2009 BALKH PROVINCEIncident Report: Brutal Police Chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report began with an account of Afghan soldiers and police officers harassing and beating local civilians for refusing to cooperate in a search. It then related the story of a district police commander who forced himself on a 16-year-old girl. When a civilian complained, the report continued, ''The district commander ordered his bodyguard to open fire on the AC [Afghan civilian]. The bodyguard refused, at which time the district commander shot [the bodyguard] in front of the AC.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivalries and friction between the largest Afghan security services -- the police and the army -- are evident in a number of reports. Sometimes the tensions erupted in outright clashes, as was recorded in the following report from last December that was described as an ''enemy action.'' The ''enemy'' in this case was the Afghan National Security Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEC. 4, 2009 ORUZGAN PROVINCEIncident Report: Police and Army Rivalry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A car accident turned deadly when an argument broke out between the police and the Afghan National Army. ''The argument escalated and ANA &amp; ANP started to shoot at each other,'' a report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afghan soldier and three Afghan police officers were wounded in the shootout. One civilian was killed and six others were wounded by gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sign of the weakness of the police is that in places they have been replaced by tribal warlords who are charged -- informally but surely -- with providing the security the government cannot. Often the warlords operate above the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOV. 22, 2009 KANDAHAR PROVINCEIncident Report: Illegal Checkpoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private security convoy, ferrying fuel from Kandahar to Oruzgan, was stopped by what was thought to be 100 insurgents armed with assault rifles and PK machine guns, a report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turned out the convoy had been halted by ''the local Chief of Police,'' who was ''demanding $2000-$3000 per truck'' as a kind of toll. The chief, said the report, from NATO headquarters in Southern Afghanistan, ''states he needs the money to run his operation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief was not actually a police chief. He was Matiullah Khan, a warlord and an American-backed ally of President Karzai who was arguably Oruzgan's most powerful man. He had a contract, the Ministry of Interior said, to protect the road so NATO's supply convoys could drive on it, but he had apparently decided to extort money from the convoys himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the day, Mr. Matiullah, after many interventions, changed his mind. The report said that friendly forces ''report that the COMPASS convoy is moving again and did not pay the fee required.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents show how the best intentions of Americans to help rebuild Afghanistan through provincial reconstruction teams ran up against a bewildering array of problems -- from corruption to cultural misunderstandings -- as they tried to win over the public by helping repair dams and bridges, build schools and train local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of reports from 2005 to 2008 chart the frustrations of one of the first such teams, assigned to Gardez, in Paktia Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOV. 28, 2006 PAKTIA PROVINCECivil Affairs Report: Orphanage Opens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American civil affairs officer could barely contain her enthusiasm as she spoke at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new orphanage, built with money from the American military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer said a friend had given her a leather jacket to present to ''someone special,'' the report noted. She chose the orphanage's director. ''The commander stated that she could think of no one more deserving then someone who cared for orphans,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil affairs team handed out blankets, coats, scarves and toys. The governor even gave money from his own pocket. ''All speeches were very positive,'' the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEC. 20, 2006 PAKTIA PROVINCECivil Affairs Report: Not Many Orphans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team dropped by to check on the orphanage. ''We found very few orphans living there and could not find most of the HA [humanitarian assistance] we had given them,'' the report noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team raised the issue with the governor of Paktia, who said he was also concerned and suspected that the money he had donated had not reached the children. He visited the orphanage himself. Only 30 children were there; the director had claimed to have 102.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCT. 16, 2007 PAKTIA PROVINCECivil Affairs Report: An Empty Orphanage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a year after the opening of the orphanage, the Americans returned for a visit. ''There are currently no orphans at the facility due to the Holiday. (Note: orphans are defined as having no father, but may still have mother and a family structure that will have them home for holidays.)''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEB. 25, 2007 PAKTIA PROVINCEDistrict Report: Lack of Resources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Taliban insurgency strengthened, the lack of a government presence in the more remote districts -- and the government's inability to provide security or resources even to its own officials -- is evident in the reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official from Dand Wa Patan, a small sliver of a district along the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, so urgently wanted to talk to the members of the American team that he traveled three and a half hours by taxi -- he had no car -- to meet them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He explained that the enemy had changed their tactics in the area and were no longer fighting from the mountains, no longer sending rockets toward his compound and other areas,'' the report noted. ''He stated that the enemy focus was on direct action and that his family was a primary target.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days earlier the Taliban crept up to the wall of his family compound and blew up one of the security towers, the report said. His son lost his legs in the explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded for more police officers, weapons and ammunition. He also wanted a car so he could drive around the district he was supposed to oversee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Americans' situation was not much better. For months the reports show how a third -- or even a half -- of the team's vehicles were out of service, awaiting spare parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOV. 15, 2006 PAKTIA PROVINCECivil Affairs Report: Local Corruption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a while the civil affairs team worked closely with the provincial governor, described as ''very charismatic.'' Yet both he and the team are hampered by corrupt, negligent and antagonistic officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial chief of police is described in one report as ''the axel of corruption.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He makes every effort to openly and blatantly take money from the ANP troopers and the officers,'' one sympathetic officer told the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officers are more clever. One forged rosters, to collect pay for imaginary police officers. A second set up illegal checkpoints to collects tolls around Gardez. Still another stole food and uniforms, leaving his soldiers underfed and ill equipped for the winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor, meanwhile, was all but trapped. Such animosity developed between him and a senior security official that the governor could not leave his office for weeks at a time, fearing for his life. Finally, the corrupt officials were replaced. But it took months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEPT. 24, 2007 PAKTIA PROVINCECivil Affairs Report: The Cost of Corruption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their meetings with Afghan district officials gave the American civil affairs officers unique insights into local opinions. Sometimes, the Afghan officials were brutally honest in their assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, provincial council officials visited the Americans at their base in Gardez to report threats -- the Taliban had tossed a grenade into their office compound and were prowling the hills. Then the officials began a tirade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The people of Afghanistan keep loosing their trust in the government because of the high amount of corrupted government officials,'' the report quoted them as saying. ''The general view of the Afghans is that the current government is worst than the Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The corrupted government officials are a new concept brought to Afghanistan by the AMERICANS,'' the oldest member of the group told the civil affairs team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, the civil affairs officer who wrote the report warned, ''The people will support the Anti-Coalition forces and the security condition will degenerate.'' He recommended a public information program to educate Afghans about democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports also evoke the rivalries and tensions that swirl within the presidential palace between President Karzai's circle and the warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCT. 16, 2006 KABULIntelligence Summary: Political Intrigue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a short but heated meeting at the presidential palace, the Kabul police chief, Brig. Gen. Mir Amanullah Gozar, angrily refuted accusations made publicly by Jamil Karzai that he was corrupt and lacked professional experience. The report of the meeting identified Jamil Karzai as the president's brother; he is in fact a cousin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Gozar ''said that if Jamil were not the president's Brother he would kidnap, torture, and kill him,'' the report said. He added that he was aware of plans by the American-led coalition to remove him from his post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He threatened the president, saying that if he were replaced he would reveal ''allegations about Karzai having been a drug trader and supporter of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-led insurgency in Afghanistan,'' presumably a reference to Mr. Karzai's former links with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incident by incident, the reports resemble a police blotter of the myriad ways Afghan civilians were killed -- not just in airstrikes but in ones and twos -- in shootings on the roads or in the villages, in misunderstandings or in a cross-fire, or in chaotic moments when Afghan drivers ventured too close to convoys and checkpoints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead, the reports repeatedly indicate, were not suicide bombers or insurgents, and many of the cases were not reported to the public at the time. The toll of the war -- reflected in mounting civilian casualties -- left the Americans seeking cooperation and support from an Afghan population that grew steadily more exhausted, resentful, fearful and alienated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the war's outset, airstrikes that killed civilians in large numbers seized international attention, including the aerial bombardment of a convoy on its way to attend President Karzai's inauguration in 2001. An airstrike in Azizabad, in western Afghanistan, killed as many as 92 people in August 2008. In May 2009, another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 147 Afghan civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEPT. 3, 2009 KUNDUZ PROVINCEIncident Report: Mistaken Airstrike</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report, filed about the activities of a Joint Terminal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Controller team, which is responsible for communication from the ground and guiding pilots during surveillance missions and airstrikes, offers a glimpse into one of the bloodiest mistakes in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began with a report from the police command saying that ''2X FUEL TRUCKS WERE STOLEN BY UNK NUMBER OF INS'' and that the insurgents planned to cross the Kunduz River with their prizes. It was nighttime, and the river crossing was not illuminated. Soon, the report noted, the ''JTAC OBSERVED KDZ RIVER AND REPORTED THAT IT DISCOVERED THE TRUCKS AS WELL AS UP TO 70 INS'' at ''THE FORD ON THE RIVER. THE TRUCKS WERE STUCK IN THE MUD.'' How the JTAC team was observing the trucks was not clear, but many aircraft have infrared video cameras that can send a live feed to a computer monitor on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, a German commander of the provincial reconstruction team ''LINKED UP WITH JTAC AND, AFTER ENSURING THAT NO CIVILIANS WERE IN THE VICINITY,'' he ''AUTHORIZED AN AIRSTRIKE.'' An F-15 then dropped two 500-pound guided bombs. The initial report said that ''56X INS KIA [insurgents killed in action] (CONFIRMED) AND 14X INS FLEEING IN NE DIRECTION. THE 2X FUEL TRUCKS WERE ALSO DESTROYED.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial report was wrong. The trucks had been abandoned, and a crowd of civilians milled around them, removing fuel. How the commander and the JTAC had ensured ''that no civilians were in the area,'' as the report said, was not explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first sign of the mistake documented in the initial report appeared the next day, when another report said that at ''0900 hrs International Media reported that US airstrike had killed 60 civilians in Kunduz. The media are reporting that Taliban did steal the trucks and had invited civilians in the area to take fuel.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports show that the smaller incidents were just as insidious and alienating, turning Afghans who had once welcomed Americans as liberators against the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARCH 5, 2007 GHAZNI PROVINCEIncident Report: Checkpoint Danger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan police officers shot a local driver who tried to speed through their checkpoint on a country road in Ghazni Province south of Kabul. The police had set up a temporary checkpoint on the highway just outside the main town in the district of Ab Band.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A car approached the check point at a high rate of speed,'' the report said. All the police officers fled the checkpoint except one. As the car passed the checkpoint it knocked down the lone policeman. He fired at the vehicle, apparently thinking that it was a suicide car bomber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The driver of the vehicle was killed,'' the report said. ''No IED [improved explosive device] was found and vehicle was destroyed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officer was detained in the provincial capital, Ghazni, and questioned. He was then released. The American mentoring the police concluded in his assessment that the policeman's use of force was appropriate. Rather than acknowledging the public hostility such episodes often engender, the report found a benefit: it suggested that the shooting would make Afghans take greater care at checkpoints in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Effects on the populace clearly identify the importance of stopping at checkpoints,'' the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARCH 21, 2007 PAKTIKA PROVINCEIncident Report: A Deaf Man Is Shot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of a C.I.A. paramilitary unit moved into the village of Malekshay in Paktika Province close to the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when they saw an Afghan running away at the sight of their convoy, one report recounted. Members of the unit shot him in the ankle, and medics treated him at the scene. The unit had followed military procedure -- first shouting at the man, then firing warning shots and only after that shooting to wound, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet elders in the village told the unit that the man, Shum Khan, was deaf and mute and that he had fled from the convoy out of nervousness. Mr. Khan was ''unable to hear the warnings or warning shots. Ran out of fear and confusion,'' the report concludes. The unit handed over supplies in compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports reveal several instances of allied forces accidentally firing on one another or on Afghan forces in the fog of war, often with tragic consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APRIL 6, 2006 HELMAND PROVINCEIncident Report: Friendly Fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British Army convoy driving at night in southern Afghanistan suddenly came under small-arms fire. One of the British trucks rolled over. The British troops split into two groups, pulled back from the clash and called in airstrikes from American A-10 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planes. After several confusing minutes, commanders realized that the Afghan police had attacked the British troops, mistaking them for Taliban fighters. One Afghan police officer was killed and 12 others were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shifting tactics of the Americans can be seen as well in the reports, as the war strategy veered from freely using force to trying to minimize civilian casualties. But as the documents make clear, each approach has its frustrations for the American effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strict new rules of engagement, imposed in 2009, minimized the use of airstrikes after some had killed civilians and turned Afghans against the war. But the rules also prompted anger from American troops and their families. The troops felt that their lives were not sufficiently valued because they had to justify every request for air or artillery support, making it easier for the Taliban to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCT. 1, 2008 KUNAR PROVINCEIncident Report: Barrage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days when field commanders had a freer hand, an infantry company commander observed an Afghan with a two-way radio who was monitoring the company's activities. Warning of ''IMMINENT THREAT,'' the commander said he would ''destroy'' the man and his equipment -- in other words, kill him. A short while later, a 155-millimeter artillery piece at a forward operating base in the nearby Pech Valley began firing high-explosive rounds -- 24 in all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOV. 13, 2009 HELMAND PROVINCEIncident Report: Escalation of Force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rules tightened, the reports picked up a tone that at times seemed lawyerly. Many make reference, even in pitched fights, to troops using weapons in accordance with ''ROE Card A'' -- which guides actions of self-defense rather than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or offensive acts. This report described an Apache helicopter firing warning shots after coming under fire. Its reaction was described as ''an escalation of force.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopter pilots reported that insurgents ''engaged with SAF [surface-to-air fire]''and that ''INTEL suggested they were going to be fired upon again during their extraction.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopters ''fired 40x 30mm warning shots to deter any further engagement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report included the information that now is common to incident reports in which Western forces fire. ''The terrain was considered rurally open and there were no CIV PID IVO [civilians positively identified in the vicinity of ] the target within reasonable certainty. There was no damage to infrastructure. BDA [battle damage assessment] recording conducted by AH-64 Gun Tape. No follow up required. The next higher command was consulted. The enemy engaged presented, in the opinion of the ground forces, an imminent threat. Engagement is under ROE Card A. Higher HQ have been informed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports show in previously unknown detail the omnipresence of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan, the Air Force's missile-toting Predators and Reapers that hunt militants. The military's use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan has rapidly expanded in the past few years; the United States Air Force now flies about 20 Predator and Reaper aircraft a day -- nearly twice as many as a year ago -- over vast stretches of hostile Afghan territory. Allies like Britain and Germany fly their own fleets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident reports chronicle the wide variety of missions these aircraft carry out: taking photographs, scooping up electronic transmissions, relaying images of running battles to field headquarters, attacking militants with bombs and missiles. And they also reveal the extent that armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being used to support American Special Operations missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents in the Afghan archive capture the strange nature of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war in Afghanistan: missile-firing robots killing shovel-wielding insurgents, a remote-controlled war against a low-tech but resilient insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEC. 9, 2008 KANDAHAR PROVINCEIncident Report: Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early one winter evening in southern Afghanistan, an Air Force Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted a group of insurgents suspected of planting roadside bombs along a roadway less than two miles from Forward Operating Base Hutal, an American outpost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the C.I.A. operated covertly across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, this aircraft was one of nearly a dozen military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patrolling vast stretches of hostile Afghan territory on any given day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes after identifying the militants, the Predator unleashed a Hellfire missile, all but evaporating one of the figures digging in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When ground troops reached the crater caused by the missile, costing $60,000, all that was left was a shovel and a crowbar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEPT. 13, 2009 BADAKHSHAN PROVINCEIncident Report: A Lost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flying over southern Afghanistan on a combat mission, one of the Air Force's premier armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Reaper, went rogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equipped with advanced radar and sophisticated cameras, as well as Hellfire missiles and 500-pound bombs, the Reaper had lost its satellite link to a pilot who was remotely steering the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from a base in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again and again, the pilot struggled to regain control of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Again and again, no response. The reports reveal that the military in Afghanistan lost many of the tiny five-pound surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with names like Raven and Desert Hawk that troops tossed out like model airplanes to peer around the next hill. But they had never before lost one of the Reapers, with its 66-foot wingspan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a last resort, commanders ordered an Air Force F-15E </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eagle fighter jet to shoot down the $13 million aircraft before it soared unguided into neighboring Tajikistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground controllers picked an unpopulated area over northern Afghanistan and the jet fired a Sidewinder missile, destroying the Reaper's turbo-prop engine. Suddenly, the satellite link was restored, but it was too late to salvage the flight. At 5:30 a.m., controllers steered it into a remote mountainside for a final fiery landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Afghanistan war took priority under the Obama administration, more Special Operations forces were shifted from Iraq to conduct secret missions. The C.I.A.'s own paramilitary operations inside Afghanistan grew in tandem -- as did the agency's close collaboration with Afghanistan's own spy agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, such teams conducted night operations aimed at top Taliban commanders and militants on the ''capture/kill'' list. While individual commandos have displayed great courage, the missions can end in calamity as well as success. The expanding special operations have stoked particular resentment among Afghans -- for their lack of coordination with local forces, the civilian casualties they frequently inflicted and the lack of accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUNE 17, 2007 PAKTIKA PROVINCEINCIDENT REPORT: Botched Night Raid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after five American rockets destroyed a compound in Paktika Province, helicopter-borne commandos from Task Force 373 -- a classified Special Operations unit of Army Delta Force operatives and members of the Navy Seals -- arrived to finish the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission was to capture or kill Abu Laith al-Libi, a top commander for Al Qaeda, who was believed to be hiding at the scene of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Libi was not there. Instead, the Special Operations troops found a group of men suspected of being militants and their children. Seven of the children had been killed by the rocket </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the men tried to flee the Americans, and six were quickly killed by encircling helicopters. After the rest were taken as detainees, the commandos found one child still alive in the rubble, and performed CPR for 20 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spread a wave of anger across the region, forcing the local governor to meet with village elders to defuse the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American military officials drew up a list of ''talking points'' for the governor, pointing out that the target had been a senior Qaeda commander, that there had been no indications that women and children would be present and that a nearby mosque had not been damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting, the governor reported that local residents were in shock, but that he had ''pressed the Talking Points.'' He even ''added a few of his own that followed in line with our current story.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was caused by the ''presence of hoodlums,'' the governor told the people. It was a tragedy that children had been killed, he said, but ''it could have been prevented had the people exposed the presence of insurgents in the area.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised that the families would be compensated for their loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Libi was killed the following year by a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APRIL 6, 2008 NURISTAN PROVINCEIncident Report: A Raging Firefight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they scrambled up the rocks toward a cluster of mud compounds perched high over the remote Shok Valley, a small group of American Green Berets and Afghan troops, known as Task Force Bushmaster, were confronted with a hail of gunfire from inside the insurgent stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were there to capture senior members of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militant group, part of a mission that the military had dubbed Operation Commando Wrath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what they soon discovered on that remote, snowy hilltop was that they were vastly outnumbered by a militant force of hundreds of fighters. Reinforcements were hours away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A firefight raged for nearly seven hours, with sniper fire pinning down the Green Berets on a 60-foot rock ledge for much of that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casualties mounted. By midmorning, nearly half of the Americans were wounded, but the militants directed their gunfire on the arriving medevac helicopters, preventing them from landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''TF Bushmaster reports they are combat ineffective and request reinforcement at this time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a time, radio contact was lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Force jets arrived at the scene and began pummeling the compounds with 2,000-pound bombs, but the militants continued to advance down the mountain toward the pinned-down group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force reported that there were '' 50-100 insurgents moving to reinforce against Bushmaster elements from the SW.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying wounded Americans shot in the pelvis, arm and legs -- as well as two dead Afghans -- the group made its way down toward the valley floor. Eventually, the helicopters were able to arrive to evacuate the dead and wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten members of the Green Berets would receive Silver Stars for their actions during the battle, the highest number given to Special Forces soldiers for a single battle since the Vietnam War. By Army estimates, 150 to 200 militants were killed in the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARCH 8, 2008 BAGRAM AIR BASEMeeting Report: A Plea for Help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward the end of a long meeting with top American military commanders, during which he delivered a briefing about the security situation in eastern Afghanistan, corruption in the government and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fecklessness in hunting down militants, Afghanistan's top spy laid out his problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amrullah Saleh, then director of the National Directorate of Security, told the Americans that the C.I.A. would no longer be handling his spy service's budget. For years, the C.I.A. had essentially run the N.D.S. as a subsidiary, but by 2009 the Afghan government was preparing to take charge of the agency's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Saleh estimated that with the C.I.A. no longer bankrolling the Afghan spies, he could be facing a budget cut of 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he made a request. With the budget squeeze coming, Mr. Saleh asked the Americans for any AK-47s and ammunition they could spare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they had any spare boots, he would also take those, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, the most shocking aspect of the secret archive is how unshocking it is. The news that our troops are underresourced and discouraged, that intelligence is garbled and fighting chaotic, that the insurgency is growing, that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are often unreliable and that the Pakistanis are treacherous allies will come as no surprise to anyone who has even casually followed the unfolding of this catastrophic war over the last 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is exactly the picture that has been drawn by journalists, political observers and other witnesses, to say nothing of scores of returning soldiers and officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps now that it comes from clandestine sources, someone in Washington will believe it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Double Game'' (editorial, July 27):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the things made public about the campaign in Afghanistan, the most troubling is, indeed, the collusion between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence agency and the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder the war is going so badly. How could it be otherwise so long as the Taliban and other radical forces are getting so much aid from both inside and outside Afghanistan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can only hope that some good will come out of knowing exactly what we are up against.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Document Leak Adds to Pressure on White House'' (front page, July 27):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is anyone surprised that the Afghanistan war is ''faring even more poorly than two administrations had portrayed''?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are our leaders continually misleading us about the importance of this conflict?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, the benefits of the war in Afghanistan are totally overrated. I'd say that the risk of new terrorist groups forming in that country and planning another 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is minimal. And besides, the United States can conduct air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to discourage that possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm befuddled as to why President Obama has adopted the Bush strategy of maintaining a large American military presence in Afghanistan when the risks to the United States have passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We continue to spend American lives and treasure in a place that is and always will be a tribal, third-world nation. Will it ever become a democracy? I doubt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why isn't the president listening to the American public? End the conflict and bring our troops home now.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Floods driven by record-breaking rainfall have killed at least 800 people and destroyed thousands of homes over the past week, officials said Saturday, in the latest disaster to test </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> already strained government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis comes as the government is struggling to fight an Islamic insurgency and to cope with the aftermath of Wednesday's plane crash in which 152 people died in the fog- and rain-shrouded Himalayan foothills just outside this capital city. It was the deadliest domestic plane crash in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the deluge was the worst since 1929 in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where water levels in dams continued to rise. And with more rain forecast for all but that part of the country, increasing the likelihood of more flash floods and landslides, government officials issued pleas for international aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are carrying out this rescue despite limited resources,'' Lutfur Rehman, a government official in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, formerly the North-West Frontier Province, told The Associated Press. The area, already ravaged by terrorism that has led to a decline in the economy, needed more helicopters and boats to aid in rescues, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also hit hard was the Swat Valley, where the government has been working on reconstruction after last year's military operation there to remove the militants; of the 65 bridges washed away by the rains, 25 were in Swat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheer scale of the floods and the government's inability to provide immediate relief has led to widespread resentment and bitterness among those affected. Displaced people have contacted local reporters and accused government officials of apathy and incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Someone lost his brother, someone lost his sister,'' a man from Nowshera, one of the hardest-hit districts, told a local news station. ''There is nothing to eat. There is no drinking water. We need food. We need tents. Where is the government?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disaster and any perception of government mismanagement could further distance the country's leaders from their people. Many Pakistanis are already angry with the leadership for allowing the United States to send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to kill members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban taking shelter there, and they blame the airstrikes for waves of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Asif Ali Zardari, who is scheduled to visit Britain this week, has already been criticized by his political opponents, who want him to cancel his trip and focus on relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request for foreign aid comes a year after the country received extensive international support for millions of its citizens who were displaced during the army's war with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, money from the United States continues to flow in, mostly recently on July 19 when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Islamabad with $500 million in economic aid. But donations from other parts of the world have slowed because of donor fatigue and concerns that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has failed to comply with economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Friends of Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a consortium of donor countries, has disbursed only about $650 million out of $2.2 billion in pledges for 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, television stations broadcast grim images of people stranded on rooftops and wading through muddy water as they waited for rescuers or tried to recover valuables from houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man identified only as from Charsadda told the AAJ television network that his whole village had been forced to spend the night by the roadside. ''We have lost everything,'' he said. ''Nothing is left.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-thousand Pakistani Army troops, 21 Army helicopters and 150 boats had been deployed to carry out rescue and relief operations, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the army spokesman, said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Nineteen-thousand people have been rescued from the marooned areas,'' General Abbas said. ''The level of destruction is so widespread, so it is possible that in some areas deaths and damages haven't been fully reported.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amjad Ali, a rescue worker in Nowshera, called conditions ''very bad. They have no water, no food.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Charsadda, Nabi Gul, who estimated that he was about 70 years old, stood shaking at the site of a rubble heap that just a day earlier had been his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I built this house with my life's earnings and hard work, and the river has washed it away,'' he said in a trembling voice. ''Now I wonder, will I be able to rebuild it? And in this time, when there are such great price hikes?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karachi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PAKISTAN'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier intelligence agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, has been accused of many bad things in its own country. It has been held responsible for rigging elections, sponsoring violent sectarian groups and running torture chambers for political dissidents. More recently, it has been accused of abducting Pakistanis and handing them over to the United States for cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week -- after thousands of classified United States Army documents were released by WikiLeaks, and American and British officials and pundits accused the ISI of double-dealing in Afghanistan -- the Pakistani news media were very vocal in their defense of their spies. On talk show after talk show, the ISI's accusers in the West were criticized for short-sightedness and shifting the blame to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for their doomed campaign in Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, the distinction between the state and the state within the state was blurred. It is our ISI that is being accused, we felt. How, we wondered, can the Americans have fallen for raw intelligence provided by paid informants and, in many cases, Afghan intelligence? And why shouldn't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, asked the pundits, keep its options open for a post-American Afghanistan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More generally, the WikiLeaks fallout brought back ugly memories, reminding Pakistanis what happens whenever we get involved with the Americans. In fact, one person at the center of the document dump is our primary object lesson for staying away from America's foreign adventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamid Gul, now a retired general, led the ISI during the end years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and together with his C.I.A. friends unwittingly in the 1990s spurred the mujahedeen to turn Kabul -- the city they had set out to liberate -- into rubble. According to the newly released documents, Mr. Gul met with Qaeda operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2006 and told them to ''make the snow warm in Kabul ... set Kabul aflame.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would seem highly sinister except that, today, Hamid Gul is nothing more than a glorified television evangelist and, as the columnist Nadir Hassan noted, ''known only for being on half a dozen talk shows simultaneously.'' He is also, for Pakistanis, a throwback to the lost years of our American-backed military dictatorships, a stark reminder of why we distrust the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISI and the C.I.A. have colluded twice in the destruction of Afghanistan. Their complicity has brought war to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities. After every round of cloak-and-dagger games, they behave like a squabbling couple who keep getting back together and telling the world that they are doing it for the children's sake. But whenever these two reunite, a lot of children's lives are wrecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the West, the ISI is often described as ideologically allied to the Taliban. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military-security establishment has only one ideology, and it's not Islamism. It's spelled I-N-D-I-A. It will do anybody's bidding if it's occasionally allowed to show India a bit of muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief, has just been given an unexpected three-year extension in his office, due in large part, it is said, to American pressure on Islamabad. Yet General Kayani headed the ISI during the period that the WikiLeaks documents cover. Since he became the head of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army -- and a frequent host to Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Pakistani territory have increased substantially. It seems he has found a way to overcome his ISI past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he generally keeps a low profile, General Kayani in February gave an off-the-record presentation to Pakistani journalists. His point was clear: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military remains India-centric. His explanation was simple: we go by the enemy's capacity, not its immediate intentions. This came in a year when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost more civilians and soldiers than it has in any war with India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it has become very clear that an overwhelming majority of Pakistani people do not share the army's India obsession or its yearning for ''strategic depth'' -- that is, a continuing deadly muddle -- in Afghanistan. They want a peaceful settlement with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir and a safer neighborhood. None of the leading parties in Parliament made a big deal about India, Afghanistan or jihad in their election campaigns. They were elected on promises of justice, transparency and reasonably priced electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, Americans seem to have woken up to the fact that there is something called a Parliament and a civil society in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But even so, it seems that Americans are courting the same ruling class -- the military elite's civilian cousins -- that has thrived on American aid and obviously wants an even closer relationship with Washington. A popular TV presenter who interviewed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her visit later jibed, ''What kind of close relationship is this? I don't even get invited to Chelsea's wedding?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and civil elite should take a good look around before they pitch another marquee and invite their American friends over for tea and war talk. There are a lot of hungry people looking in, and the strung lights are sucking up electricity that could run a small factory, or illuminate a village. Besides, they're not likely to know what WikiLeaks is -- they've been too busy cleaning up after their masters' guests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that the United States has a powerful national interest in Afghanistan, in depriving Al Qaeda of a safe haven on either side of the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border. This country would also do enormous damage to its moral and strategic standing if it now simply abandoned the Afghan people to the Taliban's brutalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, like many Americans, we are increasingly confused and anxious about the strategy in Afghanistan and wonder whether, at this late date, there is a chance of even minimal success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trove of military documents recently published in The Times showed, once again, why this is so hard: the weakness of the Afghan Army and the corruption of the Afghan government; the double game being played by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; the failure of the Bush administration, for seven years, to invest enough troops, money or attention in a war that it allowed to drag on until it has now become the longest in the nation's history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WikiLeaks documents, however, end in late 2009 and don't show us how the war is going now or whether President Obama's decision in December to send 30,000 more troops (the last won't be in place until the end of this month) has a chance of altering those realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to that question also depends on whether President Obama and his top advisers can finally secure the full commitment and cooperation of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military commander, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first test of the new counterinsurgency strategy, in Marja, population 60,000, did not go well. American Marines drove the Taliban from Marja's center in late February, but the ''government in a box'' that was supposed to win over the population with security, services and honest governance didn't arrive. Competent Afghan officials didn't want the risk or the hardship of moving there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taliban fighters quickly began a campaign of intimidation and assassination. Many local residents have been too frightened to sign up for American-financed reconstruction projects. With too few Afghan security forces to hold the town, the Marines have not been able to move beyond Marja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials say things are improving. Some schools and markets have reopened, and as of mid-July there were 21 Afghan officials working at the Interim Government Center, with another 7 to 10 positions unfilled. Marja remains isolated and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were told that Marja was a rehearsal for a major offensive this spring around Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's spiritual base. Breaking the insurgents' hold there was supposed to send a powerful message that the tide of the war is finally changing. After Marja, though, the Kandahar offensive was postponed, reinforcing the impression of drift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has promised to review his policy this December. We agree that the ''surge'' and his new commander, Gen. David Petraeus, need time. But reports from the ground have been so relentlessly grim -- July's death toll of 66 American troops was the highest since the war began -- that Mr. Obama needs to do a better job right now of explaining the strategy and how he is measuring progress. Here are some of the things Americans and American allies, who are even more anxious about the war, need to hear:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PLAN AFTER MARJA Do the president and his generals still believe that counterinsurgency -- securing crucial areas and building up local governments -- is the best chance for driving back the Taliban? Is it even possible? What lessons were learned in Marja? How has it changed their approach in Kandahar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials now insist that it was wrong to think about Kandahar as a set piece offensive. The city is already under the formal control of the Afghan government, and they say Special Forces are already pounding the Taliban outside the city while efforts to improve services and security inside are under way. Claiming that the media somehow didn't get it right doesn't help. The White House and Pentagon need to explain clearly what is happening there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first bureaucratic fights General Petraeus won after assuming command was his insistence on spending more than $200 million for diesel generators and fuel to increase Kandahar's electricity supply. That sounds like a sensible way to win local support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are concerned about the administration's decision not to challenge the control of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's younger brother and chief of Kandahar's provincial council. American officials have long claimed that the younger Mr. Karzai is involved in the opium trade and other corrupt enterprises. (He also has been on the C.I.A.'s payroll.) Washington's new line is there are suspicions but ''nothing that will stand up in court.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can a more credible government be built in Kandahar with Ahmed Wali Karzai still in place? What is the plan for bringing in and protecting more honest officials? And for tamping down the resentment of other local leaders who complain that the younger Mr. Karzai has grabbed all of the lucrative security and supply contracts? President Karzai could give a major boost to the Kandahar campaign by urging his brother to take a year or two abroad. Failing that, what is Washington doing to ensure that the two Karzais help rather than hinder the effort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CREDIBLE PARTNER At a recent international conference in Kabul, President Karzai said all the right things about fighting corruption and Afghans assuming more responsibility for their own security. (For a change, there were no anti-American tantrums.) Does the administration finally have a plan to get him to deliver? Indeed, we are still not clear about the benchmarks that are being set for adequate governance. Has Mr. Karzai been given a detailed list? How can Americans judge if they are being met?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most urgent, has the administration warned Mr. Karzai of the disastrous consequences -- in Afghanistan and in the United States -- if next month's parliamentary elections are as tainted as last year's presidential vote? Some American officials are so worried that they are hoping a way can be found to get the Afghans to postpone the vote at least until next spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronting Mr. Karzai head-on hasn't worked. The White House has now decided to play nice, at least in public. We hope American officials are a lot franker in private about the limits of the American public's patience. General Petraeus skillfully managed self-defeating politicians in Iraq. He will need to bring that skill to bear with Mr. Karzai while cultivating a wider array of leaders. He cannot do that alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constant infighting among top American officials over how deeply to invest in the war has to end. It has undermined Americans' confidence and made it far too easy for Mr. Karzai to ignore Washington's advice and demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILITARY AND POLICE TRAINING Like everything else about this war, the effort to train the Afghan Army and police was shortchanged for years under the Bush administration. President Obama has done better, but there is still a very long way to go. News of the way an ambitious Afghan military operation turned into a bloody rout by the Taliban is the latest reminder of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, the United States and NATO opened a new integrated training mission. Its leader, Lt. Gen. William Caldwell IV, has increased the number of trainers (the allies still need to ante up hundreds more), revamped the Afghan Army leadership program and standardized police instruction, including adding new literacy courses. American military officials said this week that this year's goal of 134,000 Afghan National Army troops and 109,000 police officers has already been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of discussion, General Petraeus persuaded President Karzai to support the creation of new, lightly armed village defense forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, we are concerned about a recent report from the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which found serious flaws in how the United States military has been measuring the readiness of Afghanistan's Army and police for the last five years. It also described widespread problems with drug use, corruption and high attrition rates. General Caldwell said the report was based on out-of-date information; the No. 2 American commander in Afghanistan said they were developing a more rigorous system. We are eager to learn about that system and hear the evaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REINTEGRATION AND RECONCILIATION American officials say that any exit strategy will almost certainly include some deal with some Taliban. Americans need to hear more about the plans to woo back lower-level fighters with offers of aid, jobs and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also need to hear more about the plans for reaching out to the insurgency's leaders. An Afghan peace conference in June called for creating a council to negotiate a deal with senior Taliban. Washington has laid down what it insists are clear red lines: Taliban leaders must forswear all ties to Al Qaeda and accept the Afghan Constitution, with its protection of women's rights. Mr. Karzai has embraced the same conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports that the Afghan president has been secretly negotiating with the Taliban and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is eager to broker a deal. American officials say any negotiations have to be Afghan-led, while admitting they are not fully certain who is talking to whom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know if there is a deal to be had with the Taliban. We are sure that Washington cannot sit on the sidelines. The administration also needs to be thinking hard about a diplomatic strategy to engage or at least neutralize all of the region's meddling players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANAGING </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">PAKISTAN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most alarming parts of the WikiLeaks reports were the ones that described how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military intelligence service was cynically colluding with the Afghan Taliban, which it sees as a proxy force to ensure its influence in Afghanistan and keep India's at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has said and done many of the right things to try to change </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> behavior: committing to long-term economic aid and constantly reminding Pakistani leaders that they are playing with fire and that extremists, on both sides of the border, pose a genuine threat to their own survival. It is not clear whether they are getting through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has pushed back against the Pakistani Taliban and has allowed the Americans to fly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda and other fighters along its border. It also continues to shelter and aid some of the most destructive and dangerous armed factions fighting United States and allied troops in Afghanistan. Americans need to understand what more the administration plans to do to end this support and draw Islamabad fully into the fight -- on the right side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DEADLINE President Obama was intentionally vague last December when he said that American troops would begin to transfer out of Afghanistan by July 2011. At the time, we agreed that a deadline, so long as it was not set in stone, made sense. Americans need to know this war will not go on forever. Mr. Karzai needs to know that American protection is not open-ended. American generals and diplomats need to know that their work is being closely reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the administration has sent a host -- a cacophony -- of conflicting signals about the deadline, the strategy and its commitment to the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans need regular, straight talk from President Obama about what is happening in Afghanistan, for good and ill, and the plan going forward. More ambiguity will only add to the anxiety and confusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration continues to add to the aid package for flood-stricken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- already the largest humanitarian response from any single country -- officials acknowledge that they are seeking to use the efforts to burnish the United States' dismal image there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials say their top priority is providing much-needed help to a pivotal regional ally in the fight against Al Qaeda. But when senior officials from the White House, State Department, Pentagon and Agency for International Development hold their daily conference calls to coordinate American assistance, they are also strategizing about how that aid could help improve long-term relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a survey conducted last month by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 68 percent of Pakistanis have an unfavorable view of the United States. American officials hope that images of Navy and Marine Corps helicopters ferrying supplies and plucking people from rain-swollen rivers will at least begin to counteract the bad will generated by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Many Pakistanis blame the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a devastating series of insurgent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we do the right thing, it will be good not only for the people whose lives we save but for the U.S. image in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Thursday on the PBS program ''The Charlie Rose Show.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The people of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will see that when the crisis hits,'' Mr. Holbrooke continued, ''it's not the Chinese. It's not the Iranians. It's not other countries. It's not the E.U. It's the U.S. that always leads.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials say they also hope to build greater trust with the Pakistani military, which has become increasingly wary that President Obama plans to withdraw American troops quickly from neighboring Afghanistan, leaving the Pakistanis to deal with the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flooding, which has swamped a fifth of the country and killed at least 1,384 people, according to Pakistani government figures, has led to a sizable and high-level American response, including $76 million in donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates sent 19 more helicopters last week to replace six aircraft on loan from the military campaign in Afghanistan, and he invoked Mr. Obama's personal directive to ''lean forward'' in providing assistance. American aircraft have rescued more than 4,000 people since Aug. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon announced Friday that ships carrying more relief supplies and helicopters had left the East Coast and would arrive in the waters off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in late September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much credit the United States will receive in the eyes of the Pakistanis is not clear. Some of the aid has been channeled through Pakistani and international groups because the government did not want to be associated with the unpopular Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the magnitude of the disaster, which the government says has now driven 20 million people from their homes, may be changing those calculations and, the Americans hope, breaking down that taboo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American response is putting to a practical test Mr. Obama's strategy to engage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a strategic partner on multiple levels, including economic development, counterinsurgency, law enforcement and judicial reforms, and intelligence sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as the American ally in that effort, President Asif Ali Zardari, is facing withering criticism at home for paying a state visit to France and Britain during the flooding, the worst in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a country where we have an enormous interest in their going after the Taliban and other extremist jihadi groups,'' said Mark L. Schneider, a senior vice president at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conflict resolution. ''If this kind of activity supports the Pakistani government and people supporting the Pakistani government, it's all to the good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts on the region had recently warned that public resentment of the government generated by the floods could wear away public support for the military campaign against militants, integral to American goals in the region. Those worries only deepened as hard-line Islamist charities rushed to fill the void in humanitarian aid left by the government's slow and chaotic response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, said Friday that he would visit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week to assess the damage and whether the United States needed to rethink how $7.5 billion in long-term, nonmilitary aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be spent as a result of the flooding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials say they are trying to rekindle the same good will generated five years ago when the United States military played a major role in responding to an earthquake in Kashmir in 2005 that killed 75,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the same American and Pakistani leaders who worked together during that crisis have reunited in this calamity, including Nadeem Ahmad, a retired Pakistani lieutenant general, and Vice Adm. Michael A. LeFever, the senior American officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But American officials warn that the glow from the earthquake assistance faded quickly without more enduring development programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''LeFever clearly understands the P.R. value of flood assistance, but he also knows that absent other high-profile public diplomacy efforts, the half-life of any improvement to Pakistani impressions of the U.S. will be short,'' said John K. Wood, a retired Army colonel who was senior director for Afghanistan on the National Security Council in the Bush and Obama administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American aid drawn from giant warehouses in Dubai and in Pisa, Italy, includes 500,000 halal meals, 12 prefabricated bridges to help replace the hundreds that have washed away, 14 rescue boats, and six large-scale water-filtration systems. Last week </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> submitted a several-page request for additional supplies, including more boats and bridges, a senior Defense Department official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The U.S. has been forthcoming on providing what we need,'' said Husain Haqqani, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the United States is aware that the relief effort could backfire, or at least include some negatives. Mr. Gates said relief would be paced according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> request, in part to avoid any perception that the United States is running the relief effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will also have to be mindful of how the Pakistani public perceives what will be a growing American military presence in country, though largely restricted to an isolated military base. By the end of this week, when the last of the 19 helicopters begin rescue and aid missions in the Swat Valley, about 250 American troops will be operating with Pakistani troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains difficult to calculate the long-term effects of the floods on America's goals in the country, which include focusing the Pakistani government on fighting the militants that threaten it and use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been difficult to assess, for instance, how far the flooding has set back reconstruction efforts in the Swat Valley. The rebuilding is considered crucial to keeping the area from falling back under the influence of militants the government drove out in an offensive last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the flooding is also demanding a greater role from the Pakistani military, which in turn leaves some American military officials concerned that the army's counterinsurgency campaign could falter in the northwest border regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gates told reporters last week that the Pakistani military had not been expected to launch any new offensives against militants in the short term, and he said it remained to be seen whether the flood would have a significant impact on the Pakistani government's campaign against extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Clearly, they're going to have to divert some troops, and already have, in trying to deal with the flooding,'' Mr. Gates said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is by Scott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Robert F. Worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- At first, the news from Yemen on May 25 sounded like a modest victory in the campaign against terrorists: an airstrike had hit a group suspected of being operatives for Al Qaeda in the remote desert of Marib Province, birthplace of the legendary queen of Sheba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it turned out, had also killed the province's deputy governor, a respected local leader who Yemeni officials said had been trying to talk Qaeda members into giving up their fight. Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, accepted responsibility for the death and paid blood money to the offended tribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though, was not the work of Mr. Saleh's decrepit Soviet-era air force. It was a secret mission by the United States military, according to American officials, at least the fourth such assault on Al Qaeda in the arid mountains and deserts of Yemen since December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered a glimpse of the Obama administration's shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies. In roughly a dozen countries -- from the deserts of North Africa, to the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to former Soviet republics crippled by ethnic and religious strife -- the United States has significantly increased military and intelligence operations, pursuing the enemy using robotic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and commando teams, paying contractors to spy and training local operatives to chase terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has intensified the Central Intelligence Agency's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, approved raids against Qaeda operatives in Somalia and launched clandestine operations from Kenya. The administration has worked with European allies to dismantle terrorist groups in North Africa, efforts that include a recent French and Mauritanian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near the border between Mauritania and Mali. And the Pentagon tapped a network of private contractors to gather intelligence about things like militant hide-outs in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the location of an American soldier currently in Taliban hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the stealth war began in the Bush administration, it has expanded under President Obama, who rose to prominence in part for his early opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Virtually none of the newly aggressive steps undertaken by the United States government have been publicly acknowledged. In contrast with the troop buildup in Afghanistan, which came after months of robust debate, for example, the American military campaign in Yemen began without notice in December and has never been officially confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials point to the benefits of bringing the fight against Al Qaeda and other militants into the shadows. Afghanistan and Iraq, they said, have sobered American politicians and voters about the staggering costs of big wars that topple governments, require years of occupation and can be a catalyst for further radicalization throughout the Muslim world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of ''the hammer,'' in the words of John O. Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, America will rely on the ''scalpel.'' In a speech in May, Mr. Brennan, an architect of the White House strategy, used this analogy while pledging a ''multigenerational'' campaign against Al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet such wars come with many risks: the potential for botched operations that fuel anti-American rage; a blurring of the lines between soldiers and spies that could put troops at risk of being denied Geneva Convention protections; a weakening of the Congressional oversight system put in place to prevent abuses by America's secret operatives; and a reliance on authoritarian foreign leaders and surrogates with sometimes murky loyalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yemen, for example, provoked a revenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an oil pipeline by local tribesmen and produced a propaganda bonanza for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It also left President Saleh privately furious about the death of the provincial official, Jabir al-Shabwani, and scrambling to prevent an anti-American backlash, according to Yemeni officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's demands have accelerated a transformation of the C.I.A. into a paramilitary organization as much as a spying agency, which some critics worry could lower the threshold for future quasi-military operations. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mountains, the agency had broadened its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign beyond selective </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda leaders and now regularly obliterates suspected enemy compounds and logistics convoys, just as the military would grind down an enemy force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, the Pentagon is becoming more like the C.I.A. Across the Middle East and elsewhere, Special Operations troops under secret ''Execute Orders'' have conducted spying missions that were once the preserve of civilian intelligence agencies. With code names like Eager Pawn and Indigo Spade, such programs typically operate with even less transparency and Congressional oversight than traditional covert actions by the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as American counterterrorism operations spread beyond war zones into territory hostile to the military, private contractors have taken on a prominent role, raising concerns that the United States has outsourced some of its most important missions to a sometimes unaccountable private army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Proving Ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemen is a testing ground for the ''scalpel'' approach Mr. Brennan endorses. Administration officials warn of the growing strength of Al Qaeda's affiliate there, citing as evidence its attempt on Dec. 25 to blow up a trans-Atlantic jetliner using a young Nigerian operative. Some American officials believe that militants in Yemen could now pose an even greater threat than Al Qaeda's leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said that they have benefited from the Yemeni government's new resolve to fight Al Qaeda and that the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- carried out with cruise missiles and Harrier fighter jets -- had been approved by Yemen's leaders. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration officials say, have killed dozens of militants suspected of plotting future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pentagon and the C.I.A. have quietly bulked up the number of their operatives at the embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Where we want to get is to much more small scale, preferably locally driven operations,'' said Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For the first time in our history, an entity has declared a covert war against us,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to Al Qaeda. ''And we are using similar elements of American power to respond to that covert war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some security experts draw parallels to the cold war, when the United States drew heavily on covert operations as it fought a series of proxy battles with the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some of the central players of those days have returned to take on supporting roles in the shadow war. Michael G. Vickers, who helped run the C.I.A.'s campaign to funnel guns and money to the Afghanistan mujahedeen in the 1980s and was featured in the book and movie ''Charlie Wilson's War,'' is now the top Pentagon official overseeing Special Operations troops around the globe. Duane R. Clarridge, a profane former C.I.A. officer who ran operations in Central America and was indicted in the Iran-contra scandal, turned up this year helping run a Pentagon-financed private spying operation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuing this strategy, the White House is benefiting from a unique political landscape. Republican lawmakers have been unwilling to take Mr. Obama to task for aggressively hunting terrorists, and many Democrats seem eager to embrace any move away from the long, costly wars begun by the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it has astonished some old hands of the military and intelligence establishment. Jack Devine, a former top C.I.A. clandestine officer who helped run the covert war against the Soviet Army in Afghanistan in the 1980s, said his record showed that he was ''not exactly a cream puff'' when it came to advocating secret operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that the safeguards introduced after Congressional investigations into clandestine wars of the past -- from C.I.A. assassination attempts to the Iran-contra affair, in which money from secret arms dealings with Iran was funneled to right-wing rebels in Nicaragua known as the contras -- were beginning to be weakened. ''We got the covert action programs under well-defined rules after we had made mistakes and learned from them,'' he said. ''Now, we're coming up with a new model, and I'm concerned there are not clear rules.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperation and Control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yemen came on Dec. 17, hitting what was believed to be a Qaeda training camp in Abyan Province, in the southern part of the country. The first report from the Yemeni government said that its air force had killed ''around 34'' Qaeda fighters there, and that others had been captured elsewhere in coordinated ground operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Mr. Obama called President Saleh to thank him for his cooperation and pledge continuing American support. Mr. Saleh's approval for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- rushed because of intelligence reports that Qaeda suicide bombers might be headed to Sana -- was the culmination of administration efforts to win him over, including visits by Mr. Brennan and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the commander of military operations in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accounts of the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yemen, which include many details that have not previously been reported, are based on interviews with American and Yemeni officials who requested anonymity because the military campaign in Yemen is classified, as well as documents from Yemeni investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As word of the Dec. 17 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filtered out, a very mixed picture emerged. The Yemeni press quickly identified the United States as responsible for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Qaeda members seized on video of dead children and joined a protest rally a few days later, broadcast by Al Jazeera, in which a speaker shouldering an AK-47 rifle appealed to Yemeni counterterrorism troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Soldiers, you should know we do not want to fight you,'' the Qaeda operative, standing amid angry Yemenis, declared. ''There is no problem between you and us. The problem is between us and America and its agents. Beware taking the side of America!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Navy ship offshore had fired the weapon in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a cruise missile loaded with cluster bombs, according to a report by Amnesty International. Unlike conventional bombs, cluster bombs disperse small munitions, some of which do not immediately explode, increasing the likelihood of civilian causalities. The use of cluster munitions, later documented by Amnesty, was condemned by human rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An inquiry by the Yemeni Parliament found that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had killed at least 41 members of two families living near the makeshift Qaeda camp. Three more civilians were killed and nine were wounded four days later when they stepped on unexploded munitions from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the inquiry found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials cited strained resources for decisions about some of the Yemen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the C.I.A.'s armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tied up with the bombing campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the officials said, cruise missiles were all that was available at the time. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are favored by the White House for clandestine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because they can linger over targets for hours or days before unleashing Hellfire missiles, reducing the risk that women, children or other noncombatants will fall victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yemen operation has raised a broader question: who should be running the shadow war? White House officials are debating whether the C.I.A. should take over the Yemen campaign as a ''covert action,'' which would allow the United States to carry out operations even without the approval of Yemen's government. By law, covert action programs require presidential authorization and formal notification to the Congressional intelligence committees. No such requirements apply to the military's so-called Special Access Programs, like the Yemen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials defend their efforts in Yemen. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been ''conducted very methodically,'' and claims of innocent civilians being killed are ''very much exaggerated,'' said a senior counterterrorism official. He added that comparing the nascent Yemen campaign with American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was unfair, since the United States has had a decade to build an intelligence network in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that feeds the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Yemen, officials said, there is a dearth of solid intelligence about Qaeda operations. ''It will take time to develop and grow that capability,'' the senior official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 24, another cruise missile struck in a remote valley called Rafadh, about 400 miles southeast of the Yemeni capital and two hours from the nearest paved road. The Yemeni authorities said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed dozens of Qaeda operatives, including the leader of the Qaeda branch in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, and his Saudi deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri. But officials later acknowledged that neither man was hit, and local witnesses say the missile killed five low-level Qaeda members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next known American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on March 14, was more successful, killing a Qaeda operative named Jamil al-Anbari and possibly another militant. Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch acknowledged Mr. Anbari's death. On June 19, the group retaliated with a lethal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a government security compound in Aden that left 11 people dead and said the ''brigade of the martyr Jamil al-Anbari'' carried it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, the spotty record of the Yemen airstrikes may derive from another unavoidable risk of the new shadow war: the need to depend on local proxies who may be unreliable or corrupt, or whose agendas differ from that of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials have a troubled history with Mr. Saleh, a wily political survivor who cultivates radical clerics at election time and has a history of making deals with jihadists. Until recently, taking on Al Qaeda had not been a priority for his government, which has been fighting an intermittent armed rebellion since 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for all Mr. Saleh's power -- his portraits hang everywhere in the Yemeni capital -- his government is deeply unpopular in the remote provinces where the militants have sought sanctuary. The tribes there tend to regularly switch sides, making it difficult to depend on them for information about Al Qaeda. ''My state is anyone who fills my pocket with money,'' goes one old tribal motto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yemeni security services are similarly unreliable and have collaborated with jihadists at times. The United States has trained elite counterterrorism teams there in recent years, but the military still suffers from corruption and poor discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still not clear why Mr. Shabwani, the Marib deputy governor, was killed. The day he died, he was planning to meet members of Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch in Wadi Abeeda, a remote, lawless plain dotted with orange groves east of Yemen's capital. The most widely accepted explanation is that Yemeni and American officials failed to fully communicate before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul Ghani al-Eryani, a Yemeni political analyst, said the civilian deaths in the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the killing of the deputy governor in May ''had a devastating impact.'' The mishaps, he said, ''embarrassed the government and gave ammunition to Al Qaeda and the Salafists,'' he said, referring to adherents of the form of Islam embraced by militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials said President Saleh was angry about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in May, but not so angry as to call for a halt to the clandestine American operations. ''At the end of the day, it's not like he said, 'No more,' '' said one Obama administration official. ''He didn't kick us out of the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weighing Success</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the airstrike campaign, the leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula survives, and there is little sign the group is much weaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Qaeda militants in Yemen have picked up again, with several deadly assaults on Yemeni army convoys in recent weeks. Al Qaeda's Yemen branch has managed to put out its first English-language online magazine, Inspire, complete with bomb-making instructions. Intelligence officials believe that Samir Khan, a 24-year-old American who arrived from North Carolina last year, played a major role in producing the slick publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a test case, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have raised the classic trade-off of the post-Sept. 11 era: Do the selective hits make the United States safer by eliminating terrorists? Or do they help the terrorist network frame its violence as a heroic religious struggle against American aggression, recruiting new operatives for the enemy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Qaeda has worked tirelessly to exploit the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and in Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric now hiding in Yemen, the group has perhaps the most sophisticated ideological opponent the United States has faced since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If George W. Bush is remembered by getting America stuck in Afghanistan and Iraq, it's looking like Obama wants to be remembered as the president who got America stuck in Yemen,'' the cleric said in a March Internet address that was almost gleeful about the American campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Yemenis have little sympathy for Al Qaeda and have observed the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with ''passive indignation,'' Mr. Eryani said. But, he added, ''I think the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over all have been counterproductive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmund J. Hull, the United States ambassador to Yemen from 2001 to 2004, cautioned that American policy must not be limited to using force against Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's both understandable and defensible for the Obama administration to pursue aggressive counterterrorism operations,'' Mr. Hull said. But he added: ''I'm concerned that counterterrorism is defined as an intelligence and military program. To be successful in the long run, we have to take a far broader approach that emphasizes political, social and economic forces.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials say that is exactly what they are doing -- sharply increasing the foreign aid budget for Yemen and offering both money and advice to address the country's crippling problems. They emphasized that the core of the American effort was not the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but training for elite Yemeni units, providing equipment and sharing intelligence to support Yemeni sweeps against Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the historical track record of limited military efforts like the Yemen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not encouraging. Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations, examines in a forthcoming book what he has labeled ''discrete military operations'' from the Balkans to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the end of the cold war in 1991. He found that these operations seldom achieve either their military or political objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said that over the years, military force had proved to be a seductive tool that tended to dominate ''all the discussions and planning'' and push more subtle solutions to the side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When terrorists threaten Americans, Mr. Zenko said, ''there is tremendous pressure from the National Security Council and the Congressional committees to, quote, 'do something.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is apparent to visitors at the American Embassy in Sana, who have noticed that it is increasingly crowded with military personnel and intelligence operatives. For now, the shadow warriors are taking the lead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the Obama administration's shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies in roughly a dozen countries gave an outdated affiliation in some editions for Micah Zenko, who in a forthcoming book looks at what he calls ''discrete military operations'' from the Balkans to Pakistan since the end of the cold war. Mr. Zenko is a fellow at the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations; he is no longer a scholar at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Aug. 15 about the Obama administration's secret counterterrorism operations overseas described incorrectly a recent strike in northern Africa that was cited as an example of coordination with allies. The strike in question, on July 22, was carried out by French and Mauritanian troops near the border between Mauritania and Mali; it was not a French strike in Algeria.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's all hope that Egypt, Turkey and Jordan soon get hit by a nice flood, earthquake or volcanic eruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? Because they're down with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the bottom of lists of countries that pollsters say hate the United States. And, according to students -- and some administrators -- of foreign aid, recipients of disaster relief fall in love with America, at least briefly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disaster relief as geopolitical valentine ''has an unseemly aspect,'' said J. Brian Atwood, President Bill Clinton's chief of U.S.A.I.D., the United States Agency for International Development, who is now dean of the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs. ''We shouldn't be using it to proselytize. Helping others has always been an American value.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added, let's not be unrealistic. Politics does creep in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is rare that America finds itself so overtly facing off against an ideological foe as it is said to be now in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flooded river valleys. Discussions of the global response inevitably mention that Islamic charities were first on the scene, often adding some have ''links to militant fundamentalists'' or words to that effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, pushes this line while pleading for aid, warning that ''negative forces will exploit the situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some consider this an exaggeration. Of course Islamic charities are at work: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Islamic, and Islam lauds charity just as Christianity and Judaism do. ''There are a whole range of people working here, largely quietly and unsung,'' Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, a Pakistani public health expert who wrote an editorial on the crisis in The Lancet medical journal, said in an e-mail. ''They are neither Taliban or Al Qaeda, and to call them such is a travesty.'' Nonetheless, the idea that the Taliban and the American Army are fighting to see who can hand out tents faster is firmly present in the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed on the issue by PBS Newshour, Richard C. Holbrooke, special representative to the region, said the administration was ''not oblivious to the political and strategic implications'' of its aid. But, he said, ''We're doing this because the people are in desperate need.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do those other implications matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, some experts insist. Mark L. Schneider, a former Peace Corps director now with the International Crisis Group, noted that in polls taken by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project three years before the 2005 earthquake in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, only 10 percent of Pakistanis viewed America favorably. In the year following the quake, in which American helicopters flew dozens of rescue missions, 27 percent did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have since weakened that goodwill, but ''my guess is that it will come up again,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''The U.S. is the single largest donor to this effort.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew S. Natsios, U.S.A.I.D. director under George W. Bush, now teaches at Georgetown and is an even more fervent believer in using aid to sway minds. ''To suggest people won't have a reaction when they see us feeding our enemies and our friends at the same time is silly,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the 2004 tsunami, he said, only 28 percent of Indonesians admired the United States, while 58 percent admired Osama bin Laden. Three months later, after Navy helicopters had flown rescue missions and delivered thousands of aid packages, ''and after there was a big debate in the papers about where 'our friend bin Laden' was,'' he said, approval of the terrorist leader had fallen to 26 percent and approval of Americans was at 63 percent. (Mr. Natsios cited local newspaper polls gathered by America's embassy; polling by the Washington non-profit Terror Free Tomorrow shows the same trend.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every aid package, he pointed out, bore a ''From the American People'' label his local mission chief had printed. The United States had stopped branding its aid in the 1990s because charities wanted to use only their own labels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I found that a little hypocritical,'' Mr. Natsios said. Now an ''American People'' label must be used unless it puts a charity's workers in peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other American agencies, he said, envy U.S.A.I.D.'s friendly blue clasped-hands logo, which it inherited from the Marshall Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department aid is marked with its eagle, while the logo of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is a globe with a big red ribbon. The first can be seen as militaristic; the second confuses Africans who don't instinctively connect lethal diseases with fabric trimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of disaster relief goes back at least to 226 B.C., when an earthquake struck the island of Rhodes. Ptolemy III of Egypt, according to the Greek historian Polybius, offered ''300 talents of silver and a million artabae of corn,'' plus help rebuilding the famous Colossus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such aid doesn't always stem from charity alone, said Carol J. Lancaster, dean of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. England helped Portugal after Lisbon's 1755 earthquake, tsunami and fire. Both were rivals of Spain, she said, ''and the enemy of my enemy is my friend.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans who wanted to help Ireland during its potato famine had to use their own money because President Polk wouldn't use tax dollars, Dr. Lancaster said, though he let the Navy carry grain to Cork. American Protestants ran soup kitchens, but pressed diners to convert. (Irish Catholics sneeringly called those who did ''soupers.'') The most generous gesture may have been $710 sent by the Choctaw Indians, who knew starvation from their own Trail of Tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After World War I, taxpayers did feed shattered Europe. That included Russia in its famine of 1921; the two-year American mission fed and vaccinated millions. But, however many hearts they won, Lenin's was not one. The Soviets pushed the mission out before the famine ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the Pew polls tend to bear out what aid officials believe: that help wins friends. Countries that steadily get lots of American aid with few strings attached -- African nations, South Korea, Israel -- tend to top the charts of pro-American feelings. And one nation really stands out. Ever since Barack Obama was elected, Kenyans have loved the U.S. In fact, they like it even better than Americans do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUZAFFARGARH, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where politics has long been a matter of pedigree, Jamshed Dasti is a mongrel. The scrappy son of an amateur wrestler, Mr. Dasti has clawed his way into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament, beating the wealthy, landed families who have ruled here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In elite circles, Mr. Dasti is reviled as a thug, a small-time hustler with a fake college degree who represents the worst of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> today. But here, he is hailed as a hero, living proof that in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a poor man can get a seat at the rich men's table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dasti's rise is part of a broad shift in political power in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. For generations, politics took place in the parlors of a handful of rich families, a Westernized elite that owned large tracts of land and sometimes even the people who worked it. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is urbanizing fast, and powerful forces of change are chipping away at the landed aristocracy, known in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the feudal class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a changing political landscape more representative of Pakistani society, but far less predictable for the United States. Mr. Dasti, 32, speaks no English. His legislative record includes opposition to a sexual harassment bill. He has 35 criminal cases to his name and is from the country's conservative heartland, where dislike of America runs deep.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How this plays out is crucial to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> future. The country's fast-expanding, flood-weary population needs local government as never before, but with political power shifting and institutions stillborn, the state has never been less able to provide it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have scarcity arising everywhere,'' said Ali Cheema, chairman of the economics department at the Lahore University of Management and Science. ''Scarcity creates conflict. Conflict needs mediation. But the state is unable to do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mr. Dasti's area, one of the hardest hit by the recent flooding, the state has all but disappeared. Not that it was ever very present. In the British colonial era, before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became a separate country, the state would show up a few times a month in the form of a representative from the Raj dispensing justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the local landowner took over. For years, feudal lords reigned supreme, serving as the police, the judge and the political leader. Plantations had jails, and political seats were practically owned by families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of midwifing democracy, these aristocrats obstructed it, ignoring the needs of rural Pakistanis, half of whom are still landless and desperately poor more than 60 years after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became a state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But changes began to erode the aristocrats' power. Cities sprouted, with jobs in construction and industry. Large-scale farms eclipsed old-fashioned plantations. Vast hereditary lands splintered among generations of sons, and many aristocratic families left the country for cities, living beyond their means off sales of their remaining lands. Mobile labor has also reduced dependence on aristocratic families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Punjab, the country's most populous province, and its most economically advanced, the number of national lawmakers from feudal families shrank to 25 percent in 2008 from 42 percent in 1970, according to a count conducted by Mubashir Hassan, a former finance minister, and The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Feudals are a dying breed,'' said S. Akbar Zaidi, a Karachi-based fellow with the Carnegie Foundation. ''They have no power outside the walls of their castles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dasti, a young, impulsive man with a troubled past, is much like the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he represents. He is one of seven siblings born to illiterate parents. Despite his claims of finishing college, he never earned a degree, something his political opponents used against him in court this spring. One of the 35 criminal cases against him is for murder, a charge he said was leveled by his political opponents. Detractors accuse him of blackmailing rich people in a job at a newspaper. He said he was writing exposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have more enemies than numbers of hairs in my head,'' he said, bouncing down a road in a borrowed truck. ''They don't like my style, and I don't like theirs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, he is deeply appealing to Pakistanis, who have chosen him over feudal lords for political seats several times. Local residents call him Rescue One-Five, a reference to an emergency hot line number and his feverish work habits. Constituents clutching dirty plastic bags of documents flock to his small office for help, and he scribbles out notes for them on his Parliament letterhead like a doctor in a field hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The new faces have to work much harder because their survival depends on it,'' said Sohail Warraich, chief political correspondent for Geo TV. ''If they lose an election, they're finished.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wields his lower-class background like a weapon, exhorting local residents to oppose the rich elite and the mafias of landlords, bureaucrats and other petty power brokers who support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This was not an election,'' he shouted at a sweaty crowd, referring to a race he won against an aristocrat in May. ''This was a fight between the poor and the rich, between the public and the powerful classes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graffiti nearby said: ''Give us electricity and we'll give you a vote.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lineage alone is no longer a winning strategy. Ahmed Mehmoud, an aristocrat in South Punjab, lost both Parliament seats he contested in 2008 and had to settle for a provincial assembly seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The seats are no longer so safe,'' said Nusrat Javed, a journalist who is an expert on politics in Punjab. ''You can't survive as a mere feudal anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehmoud, 48, is a wealthy man of leisure, who spends more time relaxing in his house -- a pink replica of a Rajasthani palace with a hand-carved facade -- than on his job as a lawmaker. Sometimes he talks to his constituents, but more often he watches them go by from the window of his speedy, white Hummer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, people voted for him anyway, partly out of habit. His ancestors were considered to be distant relatives of the Prophet Muhammad, which inspires awe and respect. But more important, his constituents were tied to him economically. His family owned the land they worked and often their houses. His carpet has a worn patch where generations of peasants sat in supplication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, said Shama Andleep, a local voter: ''On election day, people are asking questions. People are calculating: how much has he done for us?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private television stations, which exploded onto the scene eight years ago, have also had an effect. Khusro Bakhtyar, a landowner in the area, said the women who were baking bread in his house were so affected by the coverage of the 2007 death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that they voted for her party, not his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes have steered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into uncharted territory, and the effect for the United States is unclear. Unlike Mr. Mehmoud, who is unabashedly pro-American, newcomers like Mr. Dasti are more skeptical. Mr. Dasti opposes the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program that is used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but he is not as virulently anti-American as many in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes also leave room for Islamists. In the neighboring district of Dera Ghazi Khan, a hard-line mullah, Hafiz Abdul Karim, came within a few thousand votes in 2008 of unseating Farooq Leghari, a former president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His weapon? Efficient, Islamist campaign workers and free water pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Islamists have not tapped popular frustration in a systematic way at the ballot box, and the military, the country's oldest, strongest institution, would probably put down any broader uprising, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the floods and the misery they have brought have raised the stakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you don't give the common man justice, there will be more terrorism and even bloody revolution,'' Mr. Dasti said. ''This is the need of the hour.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama rushed to the Oval Office when word arrived one night that militants with Al Qaeda in Yemen had been located and that the military wanted to support an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Yemeni forces. After a quick discussion, his counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, told him the window to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was closing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I've got two minutes here,'' Mr. Brennan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''O.K.,'' the president said. ''Go with this.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama took three sometimes maddening months to decide to send more forces to Afghanistan, other decisions as commander in chief have come with dizzying speed, far less study and little public attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the first president in four decades with a shooting war already raging the day he took office -- two, in fact, plus subsidiaries -- and his education as a commander in chief with no experience in uniform has been a steep learning curve. He has learned how to salute. He has surfed the Internet at night to look into the toll on troops. He has faced young soldiers maimed after carrying out his orders. And he is trying to manage a tense relationship with the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the way, he has confronted some of the biggest choices a president can make, often deferring to military advisers yet trying to shape the decisions with his own judgments -- too much at times for the Pentagon, too little in the view of his liberal base. His evolution from antiwar candidate to leader of the world's most powerful military will reach a milestone on Tuesday when he delivers an Oval Office address to formally end the combat mission in Iraq while defending his troop buildup in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year and a half into his presidency, Mr. Obama appears to be a reluctant warrior. Even as he draws down troops in Iraq, he has been abundantly willing to use force to advance national interests, tripling forces in Afghanistan, authorizing secret operations in Yemen and Somalia, and escalating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But advisers said he did not see himself as a war president in the way his predecessor did. His speech on Tuesday is notable because he talks in public about the wars only sporadically, determined not to let them define his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where George W. Bush saw the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as his central mission and opportunities to transform critical regions, Mr. Obama sees them as ''problems that need managing,'' as one adviser put it, while he pursues his mission of transforming America. The result, according to interviews with three dozen administration officials, military leaders and national security experts, is an uneasy balance between a president wary of endless commitment and a military worried he is not fully invested in the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's got a very full plate of very big issues, and I think he does not want to create the impression that he's so preoccupied with these two wars that he's not addressing the domestic issues that are uppermost in people's minds,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said in an interview. Mr. Obama, though, has devoted enormous time and thought to finding the right approaches, Mr. Gates added. ''From the first, he's been decisive and he's been willing to make big decisions,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sometimes advises Mr. Obama, said the president was grappling with harsh reality. ''He came into office with a very sound strategic vision,'' Mr. Reed said, ''and what has happened in the intervening months is, as with every president, he is beginning to understand how difficult it is to translate a strategic vision into operational reality.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former adviser to the president, who like others insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the situation candidly, said that Mr. Obama's relationship with the military was ''troubled'' and that he ''doesn't have a handle on it.'' The relationship will be further tested by year's end when Mr. Obama evaluates his Afghanistan strategy in advance of his July deadline to begin pulling out. As one administration official put it, ''His commander in chief role is about to get tested again, and in a very dramatic way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the Vietnam Debate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was an 11-year-old in Hawaii when the last American combat troops left Vietnam, too young to have participated in the polarizing clashes of the era or to have faced the choices the last two presidents did about serving. ''He's really the first generation of recent presidents who didn't live through that,'' said David Axelrod, his senior adviser. ''The whole debate on Vietnam, that was not part of his life experience.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running for president of a country at war, he had plenty to learn, even basics like military ceremonies and titles. His campaign recruited retired generals to advise him. But it still took time to adjust when he became president. The first time he walked into a room of generals, an aide recalled, he was surprised when they stood. ''Come on, guys, you don't have to do that,'' he said, according to the aide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps his most important tutor has been Mr. Gates, the defense secretary appointed by Mr. Bush and the first kept on by a president of another party. They are an unlikely pair, a 49-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer turned community activist and a 66-year-old veteran of cold war spy intrigues and Republican administrations. But they are both known for unassuming discipline, and they bonded through weekly meetings and shared challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has relied on Mr. Gates as his ambassador to the military and deferred to him repeatedly. When Mr. Gates wanted to force out Gen. David D. McKiernan in May 2009 as commander in Afghanistan in favor of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Mr. Obama signed off. Likewise, cognizant of Bill Clinton's ill-fated effort to end the ban on gay and lesbian soldiers, Mr. Obama let Mr. Gates set a slow pace in overturning the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, even though it has disappointed gay rights advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even on his signature campaign promise to pull out of Iraq, Mr. Obama compromised in the early days of his tenure to accommodate military concerns. Instead of the 16-month withdrawal of combat forces he promised, he accepted a 19-month timetable, and he agreed to leave behind 50,000 for now rather than a smaller force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he grows in the job, Mr. Obama has shown more willingness to set aside Mr. Gates's advice. When General McChrystal got in trouble in June for comments by him and his staff in Rolling Stone magazine, Mr. Gates favored reprimanding the commander. Mr. Obama decided instead to oust him and replace him with Gen. David H. Petraeus, who led the troop increase in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My first reaction was if McChrystal with his experience and his contacts and his knowledge were pulled out, that could have real consequence for the war,'' Mr. Gates said. ''It never even occurred to me -- I kicked myself subsequently -- to move Petraeus over there. When the president raised that with me in a private meeting, it was like a light bulb went on -- yes, that will work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as keeping Mr. Gates provided political cover against the weak-on-defense Democratic image, Mr. Obama surrounded himself with uniformed officers. He kept Mr. Bush's war coordinator, Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, and tapped Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser. ''Picking General Jones was in part inoculation,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who led Mr. Obama's first Afghanistan review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were not always in control. General Jones has often been eclipsed by younger foreign policy advisers with closer relationships with the president. Mr. Obama ended up pushing out Adm. Dennis C. Blair as director of national intelligence, and approved the Afghan troop increase despite the warnings of Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, his ambassador to Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although General McChrystal was described in Rolling Stone as calling Mr. Obama intimidated in meeting with military commanders early in his tenure, other attendees disagreed. ''He didn't look to me like he was one bit intimidated,'' Mr. Riedel said. ''He did look like someone who was taking it all in and a bit frustrated that what seemed for him to be simple questions he was getting complicated answers to -- like how many troops do you really need?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wars as a Distraction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economy in tatters and health care on his agenda, Mr. Obama was determined to keep the wars from becoming a major distraction. When he held a videoconference on Iraq on his first full day in office, officials recalled, he said: ''Guys, before you start, there's one thing I want to say to you and that is I do not want to screw this up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while he had given much thought to ending the war in Iraq, he had not spent as much time contemplating Afghanistan despite a campaign promise to send more troops. When he took office, he found an urgent request to reinforce the flagging effort. Warned by the generals that he could not wait to study the issue, he overruled Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and sent 21,000 more troops. ''Both he and I frankly thought at that point we were done,'' Mr. Gates recalled. Within months, though, General McChrystal asked for 40,000 more troops. ''I certainly was surprised when General McChrystal came in with the request,'' he said, ''and I think the president was as well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reliant on Mr. Gates, Mr. Obama has made limited efforts to know his service chiefs or top commanders, and has visited the Pentagon only once, not counting a Sept. 11 commemoration. He ended Mr. Bush's practice of weekly videoconferences with commanders, preferring to work through the chain of command and wary, aides said, of being drawn into managing the wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So General McChrystal's request for even more reinforcements exposed the mutual mistrust, particularly after it was leaked to the news media. The president complained he was being boxed in while the military worried whether politics would drive the decision. At one point Denis R. McDonough, deputy national security adviser, pressed Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about stopping leaks by the military, according to people informed about the conversation. Admiral Mullen asked pointedly if that would also apply to the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who was skeptical of the troop increase request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If I had been in the White House, I would have been suspicious,'' Mr. Gates said. ''The leak of McChrystal's assessment was obviously very damaging in the assessment process because it put the president on the spot.'' He added: ''My position was this is not a deliberate attempt to jam the president. It's indiscipline.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December, the president gave the military 30,000 more troops, but also a ticking clock. He would start pulling troops out in July, on the grounds that if there was not visible progress by then, it would mean the strategy was not working. Some saw that as a sop to his antiwar base. Others considered it his way of reasserting control over a military that knows how to outmaneuver the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He didn't understand or grasp the military culture,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, a former Pentagon official at the liberal Center for American Progress. ''He got over that particular quandary and put them back in the box by saying, 'O.K., I'm giving you 18 months.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One adviser at the time said Mr. Obama calculated that an open-ended commitment would undermine the rest of his agenda. ''Our Afghan policy was focused as much as anything on domestic politics,'' the adviser said. ''He would not risk losing the moderate to centrist Democrats in the middle of health insurance reform and he viewed that legislation as the make-or-break legislation for his administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials reject the linkage, but said Mr. Obama believed that the wars should be judged against other priorities. Preparing to announce his decision last December, he read Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address and included a line in his own speech at West Point: ''Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungry for Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has made a point of seeking his own information, scribbling questions in memo margins and scouring the Internet. At one meeting, he surprised the generals by citing a study of post-traumatic stress disorder among soldiers serving repeat tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He reads a lot,'' said General Jones, the national security adviser. ''He studies issues before he comes to the table. That's another thing the military mind, if there is such a thing, appreciates. When he sits down to talk about an issue, he's done his homework.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing relentless and elusive foes, Mr. Obama has turned increasingly to the sort of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he authorized in Yemen and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a form of warfare with little risk to American lives even though critics question its wisdom, effectiveness or even morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama also confronts the consequences of the direct combat he has ordered. Last year, he flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to greet soldiers' coffins. During a later meeting with advisers, Mr. Obama expressed irritation at doubters of his commitment. ''If I didn't think this was something worth doing,'' he said, ''one trip to Dover would be enough to cause me to bring every soldier home. O.K.?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, during his only trip to Afghanistan in office, he met a wounded soldier, maybe 19, who had lost three limbs. ''I go into a place like this, I go to Walter Reed -- it's just hard for me to think of anything to say,'' an emotional Mr. Obama told advisers as he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment stuck with him. Three months later, after ousting General McChrystal, Mr. Obama marched into the Situation Room and cited the teenage triple amputee as he reprimanded advisers for the infighting that had led to the general's forced resignation. ''We have a lot of kids on the ground acting like adults and we have a lot of adults in this room acting like kids,'' he lectured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schisms among his team, though, are born in part out of uncertainty about his true commitment. His reticence to talk much publicly about the wars may owe to the political costs of alienating his base as well as the demands of other issues. Senior Pentagon and military officials said they understood that he presided over a troubled economy, but noted that he was not losing 30 American soldiers a month on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sensitivities about calling attention to the unpopular war in Afghanistan, and particularly America's problematic partner, played out when President Hamid Karzai visited last May. General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry wanted to take Mr. Karzai to Fort Campbell in Kentucky to honor troops leaving for Afghanistan, but the White House objected that it sent the wrong message, as if Americans were fighting for Mr. Karzai. They compromised by having Mr. Gates go as well, but without his Washington press corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''From an image point of view, he doesn't seem to embrace it, almost like you have to drag him into doing it,'' said Peter D. Feaver, a Bush adviser with military contacts. ''There's deep uncertainty and perhaps doubt in the military about his commitment to see the wars through to a successful conclusion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the public too is confused about the president's Afghan strategy, as White House aides and their critics acknowledge. ''There have only been a few moments when he's tried to focus the nation's attention on Afghanistan because, quite frankly, it's competing with the other priorities,'' said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who opposes the strategy. ''It's probably one of the reasons public support has fallen, because they see the costs but they don't know his thinking about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the flap over General McChrystal underscored the tensions, Mr. Obama's response may have actually helped ease them. ''Ironically enough, the McChrystal firing helped a lot because Obama handled it exactly the way most senior military officers would have handled it if they had been in his shoes,'' said Stephen Biddle, a critic of Mr. Obama's withdrawal deadline at the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more important was his selection of General Petraeus to take over. The choice brings Mr. Obama full circle. As a senator, he opposed the Iraq troop increase led by General Petraeus, and the two had a wary encounter in Baghdad when Mr. Obama visited as a candidate in 2008. After Mr. Obama came to the White House, General Petraeus no longer had the regular interactions he had with Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama came to appreciate General Petraeus's intelligence and dedication. He invited the general to fly on Air Force One with him to West Point for his speech announcing the Afghanistan troop increase. Six months later, after ousting General McChrystal, the president sent his personal aide to find General Petraeus and bring him to the Oval Office for a one-on-one talk. The general accepted the appointment without even a chance to call his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's an extraordinary irony,'' said Mr. Riedel, the former Obama adviser. ''He, like Bush before him, has put all his bets down on the table on one guy -- and it's the same guy.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Two human rights organizations went to court on Monday to challenge the Obama administration's decision to authorize the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical Muslim cleric now hiding in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of Mr. Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, argues that the United State government should not be permitted to kill an American citizen away from the battlefield and without judicial review.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights groups, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, asked the court to prohibit the government from killing Mr. Awlaki until the lawsuit is heard. They also demand that the government disclose the standards it uses to determine who should be singled out for killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit is the first legal challenge since administration officials disclosed that Mr. Awlaki was the first American citizen to be designated for capture or killing by the Central Intelligence Agency. The authorization, which also applies to the Defense Department, came after intelligence agencies concluded early this year that Mr. Awlaki was actively participating in plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States, including the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Mr. Awlaki has escalated his criticism of the United States in a series of written and recorded statements broadcast by Al Jazeera and posted on the Web. Calling the United States ''a nation of evil,'' Mr. Awlaki said in a March Web posting that ''jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials have argued that Mr. Awlaki, now believed to be an operative of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of the terrorist network, has essentially joined the enemy in a time of war. The government does not need a court's permission to kill an enemy soldier, the officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some legal experts and human rights activists have noted that the law requires the government to get a court warrant to eavesdrop on Mr. Awlaki or other American citizens. An order to kill him should require at least the same degree of review, the activists say, to meet the Fifth Amendment's requirement of ''due process'' before depriving an American of life or liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The United States cannot simply execute people, including its own citizens, anywhere in the world based on its own say-so,'' said Vince Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit acknowledges that singling out someone for killing can be lawful ''as a last resort to protect against concrete, specific and imminent threats of death or serious physical injury.'' But terrorism suspects designated secretly by the government and left on the target list for months or years do not qualify as such an urgent threat, the lawsuit says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Justice Department spokesman, Matthew A. Miller, would not comment on the lawsuit. But he noted that Congress authorized the use of force against Al Qaeda after the 2001 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that international law recognized a right of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anwar al-Awlaki was born in 1971 in New Mexico, where his father was a graduate student, and moved with his family to Yemen at the age of 7. He returned to the United States to attend Colorado State University and later served as an imam in three American mosques before moving to London and back to Yemen in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His publicly expressed views have grown steadily more militant, and his prolific writings and recordings have been cited as an important influence on suspects in more than a dozen terrorism cases in the United States, Canada and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has pursued terrorism suspects using missiles fired from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and from ships and jets in Yemen. Such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed hundreds of people, but the effort to capture or kill Mr. Awlaki has drawn particular attention because of his citizenship and prominence as a cleric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, the Treasury Department designated Mr. Awlaki as a terrorist, meaning that providing him legal or other services could be a crime. The A.C.L.U. and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed suit earlier this month challenging the Treasury regulations, but the department issued a license to the two groups permitting them to take legal action on Mr. Awlaki's behalf. The lawsuit challenging the Treasury regulations is still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William C. Banks, an expert on national security law at Syracuse University, said the lawsuit filed Monday faced numerous, probably insurmountable, legal obstacles. He said Nasser al-Awlaki might have difficulty showing that he had been injured by the actions taken against his son or overcoming the secrecy that protected counterterrorism programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the elder Mr. Awlaki does have legal standing to sue, the government can cite the Congressional authorization of 2001 to justify its actions, Mr. Banks said. ''The arguments in this lawsuit are creative,'' he said, ''but I think it's unlikely to succeed.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The United States government on Wednesday ratcheted up legal pressures against the Pakistani Taliban, the Qaeda-linked group accused of a role in the failed Times Square bombing in May and in the suicide bombing at a C.I.A. base in Afghanistan in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the group, accusing him of conspiring in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Central Intelligence Agency base in Khost. Seven Americans were killed by the suicide bomber, in one of the largest single-day losses of life in C.I.A. history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the State Department completed the process of labeling the Pakistani Taliban as a ''foreign terrorist organization'' and Mr. Mehsud and his top deputy, Wali ur-Rehman, as ''specially designated global terrorists.'' The move makes it a crime to provide material support to them or to do business with them, and it allows the government to freeze assets linked to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department also announced that it would pay a reward of $5 million each for information leading to the location of Mr. Mehsud or Mr. Rehman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. has been trying to kill Mr. Mehsud with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his death has been erroneously reported in the past. The criminal charges would allow the United States to seek his extradition if he were captured by another government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Taliban -- also called Tehrik-i-Taliban or T.T.P. -- is a distinct organization from the Taliban insurgency against which the United States is fighting in Afghanistan, but it has links to that group and to Al Qaeda. It operates out of the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The T.T.P. is very much part of the most dangerous terrorist threat that the United States faces,'' Daniel Benjamin, the ambassador at large for counterterrorism, said at a State Department briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The T.T.P. and Al Qaeda have a symbiotic relationship: T.T.P. draws ideological guidance from Al Qaeda, while Al Qaeda relies on the T.T.P. for safe haven in the Pashtun areas along the Afghan-Pakistani border,'' Mr. Benjamin said. ''This mutual cooperation gives T.T.P. access to both Al Qaeda's global terrorist network and the operational experience of its members. Given the proximity of the two groups and the nature of their relationship, T.T.P. is a force multiplier for Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorism specialists say the Pakistani Taliban was formed among militants operating in the tribal areas near the Afghanistan-Pakistani border around 2007. Its initial focus was on overthrowing the Pakistani government and establishing strict Islamist law in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani government has accused members of the group of playing a role in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. It also took responsibility for a suicide car-bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a police station in Kohat that killed seven people in April, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a minority Muslim sect's mosques in Lahore that killed 86 people in May, among other operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the Pakistani Taliban has shown signs of merging local concerns with the global jihadist war against the United States, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on NATO troops in Afghanistan. In August 2009, an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed the first leader of the group, Baitullah Mehsud, and Hakimullah Mehsud became leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suicide bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the C.I.A. base in Khost was carried out by Humam al-Balawi, a Jordanian doctor with ties to terrorist organizations who had led the C.I.A. to believe he was willing to become a double agent. After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Pakistani Taliban released a video that showed Hakimullah Mehsud meeting with Mr. Balawi to discuss and take joint responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which they portrayed as revenge for the killing of Baitullah Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities also believe the group was behind an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States consulate in Peshawar in April. It was the most direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an American facility in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in years, carried out by at least five suicide bombers using a truck bomb, machine guns and rocket launchers. Six Pakistani citizens were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Taliban also claimed responsibility for the failed attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square in May. Faisal Shahzad, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-born naturalized United States citizen who has been charged in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acknowledged that the group had trained him for the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some terrorism specialists have criticized the government for not designating the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization until now. But Mr. Benjamin defended the time it took to do so, saying that the government must follow ''a laborious and deliberative process'' so the determination will stand up in court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless you regard something like ''Iron Man'' as a film about Afghanistan, the movies inspired by America's contemporary wars have consistently been box-office flops. Even ''The Hurt Locker'' grossed only $16 million in theaters. Video games that evoke our current conflicts, on the other hand, are blockbusters -- during the past three years, they have become the most popular fictional depictions of America's current wars. Last year's best-selling game was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which opens in Afghanistan; it was a sequel to a multimillion-selling 2007 game that features an American invasion of a nameless Middle Eastern country. Modern Warfare 2 has made ''Avatar''-like profits for its studio, Activision. On the day the game was published in November, it sold nearly five million copies in North America and Britain, racking up $310 million in sales in 24 hours. By January of this year, the game's worldwide sales added up to $1 billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, earlier installments of the Call of Duty franchise and other military shooters -- the video-game industry's term for these games about warfare -- were, like cable-TV miniseries produced by Tom Hanks, always about World War II. But the Modern Warfare series has demonstrated that players have an appetite for games that purport to connect them to the wars their college roommates, or their sons, might be fighting in. Both Modern Warfare games are set in a mythical near-future, but the weapons -- Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AC-130 gunships, nukes -- clearly conjure Afghanistan and Iraq, as do the games' good guys (Americans, British) and bad guys (terrorists). The appeal of this quasi-fictional setting is one reason that Modern Warfare 2 now sits alongside titles from more-famous franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Super Mario on the lists of the top-selling video games ever made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt as a result, in June, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video-game industry's annual trade show in Los Angeles, it sometimes seemed as if every studio was introducing a game about a war against an enemy who might conceivably be regarded as part of the Axis of Evil. In one game scheduled for release next year, the North Koreans will mount a land invasion of the United States. In another, American troops are sent into an improbably menacing Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond their settings, what these future-war games have in common with the Modern Warfare series is a refusal to forthrightly acknowledge the inspiration for their subject matter. Video-game designers and players like to brag about how ''realistic'' the games are, but when gamers talk about verisimilitude, they're usually talking about graphical fidelity, about how lifelike the characters and environments are in an otherwise fantastical world -- and not about how the medium reflects anything else about the actual world in which we live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one war game at the expo that acknowledged the ripped-from-the-headlines nature of its setting was Medal of Honor, the latest iteration of a game franchise created in 1999 by Steven Spielberg, in the wake of ''Saving Private Ryan,'' as a World War II game for Dreamworks Interactive. The new game (the 11th in the series for PCs or consoles like the PlayStation and Xbox) will be published in October by Electronic Arts. With it, Medal of Honor is following the path trod by Call of Duty, ''rebooting'' a popular World War II series by situating a game in something that resembles the present day. Unlike its rival, however, Medal of Honor is not anticipating the very near future. Instead it is delving into the very recent past: the game will be set in Afghanistan, in the early stages of the American intervention there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a darkened room at the expo, PlayStation 3s were hooked up to HDTVs, so that a team of players, of which I was a member, could insert themselves into the avatars of coalition soldiers in the Helmand Valley and do battle with Taliban fighters. On the convention-center floor, I adopted the role of a Taliban insurgent in the ruins of Kabul, shooting at coalition (read: American) troops in a ''Team Deathmatch'' mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medal of Honor does not aspire to capture the war in Afghanistan in a documentary sense, but like other shooters, it creates a visceral sensation of combat. In essence, it forgoes one kind of realism while embracing another. Are video games like this mere frivolities that dishonor the real soldiers who have fought in the wars depicted -- as critics, including military families, have recently charged? Or does their popularity indicate that they are successfully conveying an experience of war to audiences in a way that is at least as effective and affecting as the war stories told in literature or film?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electronic Arts is no doubt hoping that Medal of Honor will make it a lot of money. Video games have become astonishingly expensive to produce -- the entrance fee to develop a big-budget, mainstream video game is now north of $20 million, and Medal of Honor probably cost significantly more than that to make. New games usually sell at retail for just under $60, and selling even a million copies of a new game is no longer considered an indication of success. The best insight I received into the size of Medal of Honor's budget, during a visit in June to Electronic Arts in Los Angeles, came when Greg Goodrich, the game's executive producer, told me that if the game doesn't sell at least three million copies, ''I'm not going to be able to do another one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medal of Honor's story begins, chronologically, just before the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, 2001. In an opening sequence, the camera -- gamers describe the perspective you see in a game as ''the camera,'' even though video games are not really a lens-based medium -- descends through the earth's atmosphere toward Afghanistan, passing communications satellites that give off the sounds of Al Qaeda ''chatter'' and of news broadcasts from Lower Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there, the game places the player in the body of a member of a Navy Special Operations team infiltrating the Taliban-held town of Gardez, Afghanistan. Medal of Honor later puts players behind the eyes of an Army Special Operations soldier, as well as an Army Ranger and an Apache helicopter gunner, as they seize Bagram air base from the Taliban, ride all-terrain vehicles through the Shah-i-Kot Valley, snipe Al Qaeda fighters near the mountain of Takur Ghar and more. (The game is rated M, for Mature, the video-game equivalent of an R rating.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the argot of video games, Medal of Honor is a first-person shooter, meaning that players see the action from the viewpoint of the characters they control. The term for the genre is something of a misnomer. Properly described, these games would be called second-person shooters, as the protagonist in them is a broadly identifiable You, rather than a richly drawn I, a character speaking in his own voice. In fact, the protagonist of Medal of Honor never talks at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most compelling things about video games is this sense of identification between the player and the protagonist. The best games do not give you a sense that you are controlling someone else -- they give you a sense that you are someone else. For this reason, over the course of the 10 or 12 hours that it generally takes to complete Medal of Honor, you never see or hear any of the four different playable characters -- beyond the sight of the hands that extend from the edges of the screen to grip the weapon that you're carrying. ''Because we don't ever want to break that immersion, that it's you, there,'' Goodrich told me in June as I watched him play through one of the game's levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Farrelly, the game's senior creative director, sat on a couch across from Goodrich. We were in Overlord, a room on the campus of Electronic Arts in Los Angeles -- nearly all the rooms used by the Medal of Honor development team are named after military operations. Camouflage netting lay on a counter nearby. ''That's where the fun comes in, at least for me,'' Farrelly said. ''I've now created this soldier fiction for the player and put him in those boots. And now I'm making him think like a soldier.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the buzzwords tossed around frequently by the Medal of Honor team is ''authenticity.'' The game has more than 50 actors, delivering thousands of lines of dialogue, with foreign dialogue recorded in Pashto, Gulf Arabic and Chechen. To create some of the animation used in the game, Medal of Honor's computer-graphics team examined videos from Afghanistan that are posted on sites like YouTube and LiveLeak. ''We want the player to feel, not like they're in a movie, but like they're in Afghanistan,'' Waylon Brinck, the computer-graphics supervisor for the game, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the effort devoted to this can be mind-boggling. Using more than 100 microphones, audio engineers recorded actual weapons fire at Fort Irwin in California, in a mock Iraqi village used by the military for training. With the Pentagon's permission, the audio team attached microphones to Apache helicopters and recorded the sounds of takeoffs and landings, as well as the sounds of the helicopters firing their rounds. They even hooked microphones up to the targets that the helicopters destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodrich described Medal of Honor as ''historical fiction,'' but it felt transgressively real when I played it. The battles are fought in civilian-free zones, where pretty much everyone you encounter is an enemy -- Taliban, Al Qaeda or Chechen -- and a threat to your life. Or rather (there's that sense of identification again), your character's life. The action is sometimes slow and methodical -- your character is asked to kill four enemies instead of 40, or 400 -- and at other times the body count exceeds that of a 1980s Schwarzenegger movie. I killed a lot, and was killed, a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the war in Afghanistan (and perhaps even its supporters) will detect at least a whiff of jingoism in the game. During one of the game's levels, as the Rangers approach the Shah-i-Kot Valley in a helicopter, one of them describes the flight's ''main course'' as ''all-you-can-eat Taliban'' and adds, ''Hope you like foreign foods.'' Within sight of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, a Ranger says, ''We'll be going there soon enough.'' At another moment, a character brags that ''we're going to make it farther than the Russians did.'' The game ends with a dedication written by its consultants, who are veterans of the Special Operations community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are limits to the game's aspirations to realism. I was repeatedly told that Medal of Honor intentionally avoided the subject of politics in favor of ''telling the soldier's story.'' Goodrich also told me, ''I don't want to make the bummer game.'' Still, mistakes are made in the game by American troops and commanders. Friendly fire accidents happen. The intelligence agencies get things wrong. No matter how skilled a player is, Americans will die. The general arc of the entire game is consistent with the theme of most war video games, which Ian Bogost, a professor at Georgia Tech and an author of several books on video games, summed up to me this way: ''War is horrible and badass.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what may have been the first -- and sometimes feels like the only -- time that someone suggested video games are making humanity less violent and militaristic, a 33-year-old Stewart Brand, writing about the video game Spacewar in Rolling Stone in 1972, opined that ''Spacewar serves Earthpeace.'' Invented by a band of students at M.I.T. in 1962, Spacewar is regarded by many observers as the first successful video game. Brand was smitten. He wrote that this new form of digital play (''the enthusiasm of irresponsible youngsters'') was ''heresy, uninvited and unwelcome'' in a world of ''passive consumerism.'' Spacewar, and by logical extension the new medium of video games, was remarkable, Brand went on, because it was ''intensely interactive in real time with the computer,'' because it ''bonded human and machine,'' because it ''served human interest, not machine'' and, perhaps best of all, it was ''merely delightful.'' (Brand also wrote that the fact that ''computers are coming to the people'' was ''good news, maybe the best since psychedelics.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the intervening four decades, most of the rhetoric, if not the evidence, has been on the other side of the debate. Not many of the first observers of video games were willing to give Earthpeace a chance. From almost the moment that arcades and consoles appeared in America's shopping malls and living rooms, critics have charged that video games ''add to the dehumanization and objectification of human beings,'' as a rabbi from the Philadelphia suburbs put it on ''The MacNeil/Lehrer Report'' in 1982, a time when the country came down with a seemingly anodyne bout of Pac-Man fever. Six years before that, the nation had already seen what one historian of the medium calls ''the first major moral panic over the content of a video game'' when ''60 Minutes'' examined the controversy over 1976's Death Race, a sort of proto-Grand Theft Auto involving rudimentarily animated cars that drove over rudimentarily animated pedestrians. The apotheosis of this critique could be heard years later, in 1999, when the video game Doom was blamed, implausibly, for helping to prepare Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris to carry out the Columbine massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As video games have become a more-or-less accepted form of mass entertainment for adults, arguments like these have been heard with less frequency and mounted with less vigor. But many people still find something unsettling about the medium. A mini-scandal over Medal of Honor played out in August after Karen Meredith, the mother of Ken Ballard, an Army lieutenant killed in Najaf, Iraq, in 2004, went on ''Fox and Friends'' and said that any game based on a continuing conflict was ''disrespectful'' to those whose family members have died in the war. ''Families who are burying their children are going to be seeing this,'' she said. Not long after Meredith's interview with Fox News, Britain's defense secretary, Liam Fox, called the game ''un-British'' because, in its multiplayer incarnation, it will allow players to fight as the Taliban against coalition forces. ''I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product,'' he said. Earlier this month, a Defense Department agency asked GameStop, a chain of video-game stores, not to sell Medal of Honor on Army and Air Force bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liam Fox is a member of Britain's Conservative Party; others, on the left, have raised their own reasons to find Medal of Honor disquieting. An editor at Mother Jones, Adam Weinstein, blogged in August that the game is ''war profiteering of the first order,'' and Adam Serwer, who blogs for The American Prospect, wrote, ''Realistic war simulations have always bothered me.'' Serwer added, ''I'm playing video games to escape from the frustrations of the real world, I don't want to be thrust into another, realistic existence far more bleak than the one I'm currently living.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many gamers, however -- no matter their politics -- subscribe to a McLuhanesque notion that only the form, and never the content, of this medium is of significance. Video games, in this view, are about problem-solving and game play, the captivating, kinetic interaction between the movements a player makes on a controller and the simultaneous action on-screen. And it's surely true that Medal of Honor's game play will determine whether it is a best seller or a bust. ''Whether this is set on Afghanistan or set on the moon, it doesn't really matter,'' Geoff Keighley, a video-game journalist who hosts a show on Spike TV, told me. Will Wright, the designer of games like SimCity and The Sims, has seemed to embrace this view, saying that games are about agency (the ability to navigate a virtual world), not empathy (relating emotionally to the particulars of that world). But in many ways, the main project of the past several years among video-game developers has been to try to prove Will Wright wrong. Maybe the agency that games allow can, in the hands of the right storytellers, lead to empathy. Maybe the interactive nature of video games can, when combined with narrative elements like story and character, evoke feelings in players in a way that is unique to the medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the video gamers who choose to play military shooters typically take the fictional elements of these games quite seriously. A survey conducted by Joel Penney, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, found that these gamers viewed their chosen pastime as something more than simple escapism or problem-solving exercises with good sound effects. The players -- adults mostly between ages 18 and 29 (though some were in their 50s), largely Americans and almost all men -- said playing the World War II versions of Medal of Honor or Call of Duty made them feel empathy for their countrymen. One wrote that, after playing the games, his ''feelings have deepened in respect for those who have died.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Goodrich told me that the ''holy grail'' of his medium was to get game play and fiction to interact in such a way that the fusion of the two would affect players in ways that movies and books cannot. ''I think you have the potential to touch them in a more emotional and engaging way because they took part in it,'' he said. Penney's study suggests that military shooters, by grounding their stories in the lived experiences of American soldiers, have had more success in this realm than their designers are given credit for. Feeling empathy for real soldiers fighting in foreign wars is not the same as feeling it toward fictional characters, but without being moved by the fiction in these games, it's hard to see how players were subsequently moved to feel more humanely toward their fellow citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of the second decade of the 21st century, video games are taken more seriously as a form of entertainment than ever before, even by the priests of high culture. Nicholson Baker recently wrote in The New Yorker that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 might be ''truer, realer than almost all war movies.'' Junot Diaz cheerfully reviewed Grand Theft Auto IV -- the kind of game that once provoked a moral panic with every sequel -- in The Wall Street Journal a couple of years ago. And in The London Review of Books last year, John Lanchester called the first Modern Warfare game, published in 2007, ''more involving'' than the Hollywood movies with which it might be compared. ''The next decade or so is going to see the world of video games convulsed by battles between the moneymen and the artists,'' Lanchester wrote. ''If the good guys win, or win enough of the time, we're going to have a whole new art form.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the feeling among many video-game players is that the artists lost an important skirmish a little more than a year ago. In April 2009, the video game Six Days in Fallujah was canceled by its Japanese publisher, Konami, in the very same month that the game's development was announced to the public. Six Days in Fallujah had been billed as an ''interactive documentary'' about the second battle of Fallujah in 2004. In addition to working with actual Marines who fought in Fallujah, the game's developers said they were talking to Iraqis who lived through the battle -- both civilians and insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Tamte, the president of Atomic Games, the North Carolina-based studio that was developing Six Days in Fallujah for Konami before it was canceled, told me this summer that ''the heart of the controversy that caused Konami to pull out of the project'' was the combination of ''the stereotypes that are associated with the word 'game' and the incompatibility of that with the word 'Iraq.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read Omohundro, the captain of a Marine company that fought in Fallujah, served as a consultant on the game. ''It's very important to have the enemy's perspective of what's going on,'' he told me. ''You have to understand the environment, and if you just see it from the American viewpoint, that's all you know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six Days in Fallujah proposed adding ''a layer of moral ambiguity'' to warfare that Jamin Brophy-Warren, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who now publishes Kill Screen, a magazine about video games, says he hasn't seen in other military shooters. Brophy-Warren says he was ''kind of blown away'' by the demo for Six Days in Fallujah that he saw last year in San Francisco during the annual Game Developers Conference. ''There's an Iraqi who picks up a gun, and you don't know if he's an insurgent or not,'' he said. ''Do you shoot him?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omohundro described the reaction from the public, especially from a group of mothers whose sons had been killed in action in Fallujah, as ''blinded by fury.'' Beth Houck, the mother of David Houck, a Marine rifleman who was killed in Fallujah in 2004, told me that her objections to Six Days in Fallujah apply to Medal of Honor as well: despite the genre's claims to authenticity, military shooters do not show the toll the wars have taken on the homefront. ''They don't show the heartache of family members who are left without a spouse, or a father, or a child who does not return,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omohundro says he is disappointed the game was never completed. A video game, he suggested, can portray combat in a way that is impossible to achieve in another medium. ''In a movie, you don't get the opportunity to make decisions that have consequences,'' he said. ''You simply watch what's on the screen that's in front of you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Marines that Six Days in Fallujah planned to portray would have been based on real people who fought in a real battle. The soldiers in Medal of Honor, on the other hand, are fictional characters. But some of them are inspired by the careers of real service members, men now working as consultants to the game who have experience in Special Operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. On Father's Day, I met with three of them for brunch at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, Calif. They did not tell me their names and instead asked to be known by the handles -- Coop, Dusty and Vandal -- by which they are known inside Electronic Arts. They said they have done ''extensive work in the two main theaters, and theaters outside of those as well,'' as Vandal put it. Greg Bishop, a retired lieutenant colonel who worked with the Medal of Honor team for two years as the Army's liaison to the entertainment industry, told me later that the men represented themselves accurately. Vandal and Coop said they came from a background in naval special warfare -- meaning the most elite Seals -- and Dusty is a former member of the Army Special Operations unit commonly known as Delta Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the three men would discuss their current work, but a Central Intelligence Agency contractor with the handle of Dusty is mentioned in the book ''Jawbreaker,'' by the former C.I.A. field commander Gary Berntsen, as a participant in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. They did not sport beards or balaclavas and wore sunglasses only because we were sitting outside. They all wore taut T-shirts and jeans or khakis. Dusty brought his wife. They addressed one another openly by their first names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before, Dusty sat for an interview for a promotional Web video for the game. In a nasal Georgia accent that was obscured, along with his face, when snippets of the interview were posted on the Medal of Honor site, Dusty talked about riding in a pickup truck from Jalalabad into the mountains of Tora Bora in December 2001. He stood on a ridge only about 3,600 feet from an Al Qaeda camp. He watched planes drop 675,000 pounds of bombs on the camp over the course of 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even a man who may have come painfully close to killing Bin Laden feels the need to look cool for a teenage child. ''The reason it was important for me to be involved in the game was so I could impress my 19-year-old son,'' Dusty said. ''He was like: 'You? They asked you? For your advice, Dad?' '' More important, Dusty went on to say, ''I want people to come away with an honest feeling of what it's like to be out there, doing some of that stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Ritz-Carlton, Coop, Dusty and Vandal acknowledged that one of the things they asked the Medal of Honor developers to do was to make the game less realistic than its creators initially envisioned. In a document called ''Faceless'' that the consultants wrote and circulated to the Medal of Honor team when they first joined the project, the men explained that their cooperation was dependent on maintaining their community's reputation as silent professionals. ''People want to know who these men are,'' they wrote. ''With MOH'' -- everyone at E.A. calls Medal of Honor ''MOH,'' pronounced like the Stooge or the bartender from ''The Simpsons'' -- ''they are going to get a little slice of that. However, a little slice is all they should get.'' At the men's behest, Medal of Honor refers to these elite members of the Special Operations community merely as ''Tier One.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They're selling authenticity and realism,'' said Coop, a thick man with a Boston accent; he looks not unlike one of the muscled space marines in Gears of War, a popular sci-fi video game. ''We wanted to help bring that to the table,'' he said. ''But we also wanted to make sure it didn't go too far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer, Goodrich showed the men storyboards for a game, with the title Medal of Honor: Anaconda, that would be something like a ''Black Hawk Down'' for Afghanistan: it would be based on the disastrous 2002 operation known as Anaconda, including the battle of Takur Ghar, in which Neil Roberts, a Navy Seal, fell out of a helicopter and was dragged away to his death by Al Qaeda fighters. The game ''resembled very closely events overseas that involved friends of ours that had been killed,'' Coop said. ''We thought it hit a little too close to home'' and would ''put a sour taste in our brothers' mouths.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That night, Goodrich told the men at dinner that he would excise the scene with Neil Roberts from the game and change the game into a work of historical fiction rather than a sort of docudrama. In Medal of Honor, when a helicopter is hit over the mountain of Takur Ghar, the men on board leap out and take the fight to the enemy. Goodrich says the consultants helped to make the game ''authentic and plausible'' rather than ''accurate and realistic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's nothing so close where it's a re-enactment,'' Coop said at brunch. ''In my eyes, that would be wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all soldiers are eager to endorse video games as a medium for helping audiences understand the nature of combat. As an Army platoon leader in 2002, Andrew Exum found himself in the Shah-i-Kot Valley, where he killed a man for the first time in his life and then found the gear of three dead Rangers who had been sent to try to rescue Neil Roberts. ''I can tell you I'd probably be a little offended if things were exactly modeled on some of the things that happened during Anaconda,'' Exum, now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told me. ''Returning that gear to those guys who were in the First Rangers, it was a tough thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exum emphasized that he is not outraged by Medal of Honor or any other military shooter. But he can't help, he says, being a little bit bothered by these games. ''This is the thing,'' he told me. ''Point 5 percent of this country actually fights in these conflicts.'' Nearly 80,000 Americans are deployed in Afghanistan, Exum said, while 2.2 million played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox Live during a single day last fall. ''There's something annoying that most of America experiences the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are actually taking place, through a video game,'' he said. Would he feel similarly, I later asked, if Americans were heading to a movie called ''Medal of Honor'' about Operation Anaconda? ''I think there is a difference between being a participant and an observer,'' Exum replied in an e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All war fiction, granted, reduces combat to something less than what it is in reality. '' 'The Iliad' trivialized war into something ancient feasters could listen to while they ate,'' Roger Travis, a classics professor at the University of Connecticut, wrote earlier this year on his blog about video games. But it does seem a fair critique to suggest that military shooters turn the classic description of war on its head, converting the experience into long periods of sheer terror punctuated by moments of boredom. ''Real war's a lot more like 'Catch-22' than 'Black Hawk Down,' '' one veteran told me. ''No one would dramatize the real experience'' of a platoon in Afghanistan ''because it's too boring,'' he added. ''How do you make a game out of drinking chai with an elder?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Onion actually gave this a shot last year, with a mock news broadcast about ''Modern Warfare 3,'' described as ''the most true-to-life military game every created, with the majority of game play spent hauling equipment and filling out paperwork.'' In this nonexistent game, the single-player campaign lasts ''a record 17,250 hours.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, comedy is easy. Making video games is hard. Medal of Honor may not reinvent the first-person shooter, but some in the industry -- including several who worked on Six Days in Fallujah -- hope that its mere existence is a brave and incremental step that will pave the way for nonfiction approaches to war in the medium. A video-game documentary about Iraq or Afghanistan is inevitable, whether it is a Medal of Honor sequel, or Six Days in Fallujah, or another game altogether, Read Omohundro told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think that eventually it will be permitted,'' he said. ''And if it becomes permitted, it will be accepted. It's just going to take a while.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful warlord and militant leader, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, struck a truce with the Pakistani military and agreed to stay on the sidelines last year as the military waged an offensive in the South Waziristan tribal area against the Pakistani Taliban, a group dedicated to attacking the Pakistani government, among other targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bahadur has focused instead on battling American and NATO troops across the border in Afghanistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence officials told The Associated Press that two missiles targeted a home in the North Waziristan tribal area where Mr. Bahadur's associates were believed to be staying. The officials said three men were believed to be wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A steady series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thought to be from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have happened in North Waziristan, a lawless region home to Al Qaeda leaders plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the West, insurgents battling foreign troops in Afghanistan and extremists behind bombings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four airstrikes pounded the area over 24 hours this past week, the last killing five suspected militants early Thursday, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were at least four other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earlier in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most are believed to be fired from the remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which can hover for hours above the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has condemned the American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as violations of its sovereignty, warning that the civilian casualties they cause deepen anti-American sentiment and complicate the fight against terrorism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Asif Ali Zardari of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared their determination to combine efforts to fight militancy and together bring peace to the region after meeting here Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are close allies, even though relations between their countries have been strained over the years since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both strongly endorsed a vision of fighting militancy together and improving security cooperation at a news briefing after a meeting in the presidential palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Karzai has often accused the Pakistani military of seeking to undermine his government and of supporting Taliban insurgents who are fighting in Afghanistan, but he has found a sympathetic hearing in the Zardari administration that has changed the tone of bilateral meetings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani official close to the talks described a ''breakthrough moment'' when the two presidents agreed in front of their ministers to put an end to the ''games that have been played, games that have not been ours.'' The official was quoting Mr. Karzai. Mr. Zardari agreed, the official said, that ''full peace can only be achieved when both countries actively cooperate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overtures came as missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday struck North Waziristan, a region close to the Afghan border where the Taliban and Al Qaeda are active. In recent weeks, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have come almost daily, the most intense they have been since they began in 2004, and they appear to be aimed at ordinary fighters and groups conducting cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twelve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this month have killed more than 60 people, according to news reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, the Pakistani government has often publicly criticized the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as interference with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty, but it is covertly cooperating on providing intelligence for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security officials say. Despite the increase in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the last two weeks, the government reaction has been muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari and his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party are strongly opposed to the Taliban -- his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2007. Yet they have an uneasy relationship with their own military establishment and remain weak partners in the fight against militancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani military still controls foreign and security policy, and although it has moved against Pakistani militants, it has left Afghan militants largely alone, much to the frustration of officials in Kabul. It has also been much cooler in its relations and cooperation with Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was not present at meetings with the Afghan delegation on Wednesday and was not scheduled to meet them on Thursday either, said his spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Karzai has repeatedly called on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to stop harboring Taliban insurgents who enjoy sanctuary in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a staging ground for their insurgency against the Afghan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Mr. Karzai has offered peace talks to the Taliban and other insurgent leaders, like the renegade commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and he has sought </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> help in influencing Taliban leaders, who he says reside in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, toward making peace. He has increasingly expressed doubts in the ability of United States and NATO forces to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and indicated that a peace deal through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an alternative solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the tone of both presidents on Wednesday leaned strongly toward fighting the Taliban rather than making peace with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Karzai said he was offering peace to only those insurgents who renounced ties with Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks, accepted the Afghan Constitution and did not hold ''ideological enmity'' toward the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We must both find the courage to be frank and open and intrusive in dialogue so we can find a way out together for the benefit of our populations,'' he said, ''and this trip is in that connection and with that purpose.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari said that both countries were suffering from the same ''cancer of terrorism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militants ''are our joint enemies,'' he said. ''Now the question is, how do we raise the bar and cooperate. More in-depth, international and local cooperation needs to be brought to the table, and more needs to be done from both sides.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was opposed to talks with the Taliban and has not negotiated with the Pakistani Taliban since a failed effort to forge a peace deal with militants in the Swat Valley in 2009, a Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Afghan government has announced a policy of talking to some members of the Taliban, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would help, but ''both our nations have suffered at the hands of the extremists and if the two of us join hands, we can win,'' the official said. The official asked not to be identified in keeping with government rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INSPIRE magazine, an English-language journal published by Al Qaeda, included in its summer edition what amounted to a ''Friends and Foes'' list. There, on Page 4, following the letter from the editor (''We survive through jihad and perish without it''), were pictures of, and quotations from, kindred spirits like Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty in a plot to detonate a car bomb in Times Square, and, perhaps surprisingly, David Letterman, who was praised for recent criticism of former President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the magazine's ''foes'' were Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France; and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Then there was Mitchell D. Silber, a studious and mild-mannered former financier who grew up in Atlantic Beach, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Silber (''I guess I was flattered in a strange way'') may seem an unlikely choice to occupy that space with a terrorist, a television star, a cabinet secretary, a European head of state and an Arab potentate. He is not, after all, a boldface name. Rather, he is a 40-year-old father with a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University who says his main hobby is reading deeply on the Middle East.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What landed Mr. Silber on that list was his leadership of a little-known counterterrorism team deep within the crime-fighting structure of the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formally known as the Analytic Unit of the department's Intelligence Division, the team was created in 2002 as part of the city's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It stands as a unique experiment in breaking traditional law-enforcement boundaries, comprising two dozen civilian experts -- lawyers, academics, corporate consultants, investment bankers, alumni of the World Bank and the Council on Foreign Relations and even a former employee of the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team serves as the Police Department's terrorism reference arm: available on demand to explain Islamic law or Pakistani politics to detectives in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have found that conducting terrorism investigations is more art than science and requires a breadth of complementary skill sets,'' Mr. Silber said during one of several interviews this summer. ''Our detectives tend to have a very narrow focus. But the analysts have 360-degree visibility. They focus on the bigger picture, and they sometimes see things detectives don't see.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bolster counterterrorism operations after 9/11, the Police Department expanded its Intelligence Division -- run by David Cohen, a 30-year veteran of the C.I.A. -- with detectives who had mainly spent their careers chasing street gangs, drug lords and violent Mafiosi. Such trained investigators brought with them specific skills the department thought would translate into the fight against terror: the ability to read a suspect's manner and the talent for managing secret informants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they needed, in turn, were people to help them translate their skills to new terrain, people with a firm cultural grasp of the suspects they were meant to be pursuing. Over the years, a gang detective in the Bronx will probably have developed a radar able to determine at a glance the meaning of a hand gesture or a prison tattoo. But, as one former intelligence detective said of potential Islamic extremists, ''when we first started, we didn't even know they prayed on Fridays.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the Analytic Unit, which Samuel J. Rascoff, who ran it from 2006 to 2008 and is now a law professor at New York University, described as an attempt to bring ''the culturally exotic world of the ivory tower to bear on the gritty problems of counterterrorism as experienced by beat cops and seasoned detectives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the time a detective was investigating an Afghan immigrant suspected of involvement in terror activities. The detective found it helpful when an analyst informed him that the United States military had attacked the man's hometown three months earlier with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes, analysts walk detectives through Google Earth images of Pakistani villages -- the mosque is here, the bazaar is there -- so the detectives sound more informed and enhance their credibility when dealing with potential covert sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Say a detective is doing surveillance on a cabdriver and he pulls over and goes into a mosque,'' Mr. Silber said. ''Is this a secret meeting or is it Ramadan and the driver is simply going to pray? The detective is just unlikely to be familiar with that kind of thing, but the analyst can put it in context.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Silber's analysts earn $55,000 to $95,000 a year working daily shifts at their offices in Manhattan and at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, but are available to put things into context around the clock, at the ring of a cellphone. Their assistance can be as complicated as explaining the interlocking network of Afghan tribes or the nuances of the Koran, or as simple as keeping current with New York's foreign-language newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one detective from the Intelligence Division's Priority Targeting Unit, which focuses on the highest-profile cases, said: ''I'm not reading that stuff. I'm reading Sports Illustrated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LESS than an hour after a Nissan Pathfinder was found spewing smoke and rigged with a car bomb on West 45th Street on May 1, several members of the Analytic Unit had gathered at their secret office on the West Side of Manhattan trying to assess what, by all accounts, was the most severe terror threat to face the city in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next 24 hours, as detectives in the field scoured the car for clues, pulled apart the bomb and began tracking down witnesses, their civilian counterparts helped them, by brainstorming leads to be pursued. In which stores, they asked themselves, could the fireworks and propane tanks that had made up the bomb be obtained? And what did that Arab-language sticker on its timing device -- a cheap alarm clock -- say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit's linguists monitored jihadist Web sites for useful hints or boastful chatter. Others searched the Internet -- sometimes using methods as basic as typing ''Times Square car bomb'' into Google, but filtering the results through eyes trained to see obscure tidbits. Eventually, they came across a YouTube video posted by the Pakistani Taliban, claiming responsibility for the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyber specialists were able to determine that the YouTube account had been set up less than 24 hours before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred. The video was analyzed by the unit's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expert, who knew, for instance, that a leader of the group, the Tehrik-i-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or T.T.P., had posted videos during the previous month, announcing that commandoes had ''penetrated'' the United States and were poised to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 9 p.m. on May 2, a Sunday, the Analytic Unit had prepared an eight-page report for Mr. Cohen, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for intelligence, suggesting that an ''evolving, highly dynamic'' terrorist group, T.T.P., was probably behind the failed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in Washington announced the same conclusion days later. (Mr. Shahzad eventually acknowledged that the group had trained him for the operation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No other municipal police force in the country has a team similar in scope and sophistication to the Analytic Unit. Its specialists speak Urdu, Farsi, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew, and ''cover'' subjects including South Asia, Somalia, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Iran and homegrown terrorist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit began with five analysts working for a police captain. When Mr. Rascoff, its first civilian leader, was tapped four years ago to enhance the team -- quadrupling its size to 20 -- he described his mission as finding people who ''combined very solid analytic and cultural skills with the ability to make it in a world of cops where the coin of the realm is not whether your degree came from Harvard or Columbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an Ivy Leaguer himself who once clerked for a Supreme Court justice, Mr. Rascoff understood it would be difficult having ''pointy-headed youngsters'' interacting with veteran cops and wanted analysts with what he called ''a low jerk quotient.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Silber, who was hired to run the team in 2008 and has further expanded it to 24 analysts, spent nine years in the financial world with the Carson Group and Evolution Capital, but left because, as he put it, 9/11 made him want ''to get into the fight.'' At Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, he specialized in Saudi Arabia's laws regulating the flow of terrorist money. ''I went from corporate finance to terrorist finance,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysts he has brought in are mostly in their 20s and 30s and have worked at the United Nations, the State Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the New America Foundation, a research group in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We come into this with a couple of years' experience in a region, or with a law degree or master's degree,'' said one analyst, Jennifer, who, like most, spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, for security reasons. ''We're not like the street cops. But it's the blending of those worlds that's the best part of the job.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rascoff said this ''blending'' was his goal. Analysts sometimes accompany detectives into the field, where they offer what Sgt. Steven Hines called ''another set of eyes.'' Those eyes are often attuned to what police eyes may not see: a poster in Pashto for a local demonstration against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or a collection box on a deli counter seeking spare change for a charity suspected of having terrorist ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rascoff said the working relationship between the civilian and sworn counterterrorism officials in New York was better than the parallel relationships in the Federal Bureau of Investigation because federal agents, unlike the local detectives, were often as highly educated as the analysts they work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''F.B.I. agents sometimes look at their analysts and say, 'So, basically, we do the same job, but I carry a gun and kick down doors while you sit at your desk all day,' '' said Mr. Rascoff, who has been working in intelligence since 2003, when he was a consultant to L. Paul Bremer, the special envoy to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the C.I.A., Mr. Rascoff added, the relationship between operatives and analysts is often the chilly one between ''an author of cables and a reader of cables.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Police Department, he said, there is an ''educational, experiential but not intellectual'' gulf that can, paradoxically, bring the sides together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While it's sometimes hard to harness those conflicting energies,'' Mr. Rascoff said, ''when it succeeds, it succeeds wildly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers agree, noting that academics versed in the culture of the region are able to seize upon investigative subtleties that they themselves might miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''An analyst once pointed out an individual on the street I thought was Afghan, but was actually Pakistani,'' said the detective from the Priority Targeting Unit. ''She knew because of the henna in his beard, the lack of a mustache and the pants length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They're from a different world,'' he added. ''They're educated; I'm not. My education is locking up bad guys.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another detective, sounding a bit like a Woody Allen character, put it this way: ''Whenever I have problems, I call my analyst.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE history of domestic intelligence in the United States has, to say the least, a checkered record. From Cointelpro, a series of F.B.I. counterintelligence programs, to the New York Police Department's own spying at the Republican National Convention in 2004, there are enough instances of the authorities' inappropriately surveilling their own citizens to make even the firmest law-and-order advocate wince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Dunn, a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union who has criticized the Police Department's surveillance of political groups, expressed some concern about the arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is yet another step toward the N.Y.P.D. being able to operate entirely outside of the larger law-enforcement community,'' he said. ''This type of lone-wolf approach, which we saw during the convention, is a recipe for abuse, or worse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if civilian analysts help bring intellectual rigor to terrorism investigations, if the police ''are more sophisticated and less stereotypical in their work,'' Mr. Dunn added, ''that's all to the good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigations undertaken by the Analytic Unit, like those of the Intelligence Division over all, are governed by legal controls put in place in 1985 as a result of a 1971 class-action lawsuit, Handschu v. Special Services Division, that concerned harassment of political groups by the department's so-called Red Squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Silber argued that, by nature, a team of academics trained in Islamic law and mores mitigated abuse. ''The unit helps detectives dealing with sources and suspects to be more sophisticated,'' he said, ''and to develop a nuanced understanding of doctrines, ideology and historical and cultural references.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK seems an ideal place to practice this theory of intellectual investigation, and the unit has managed over the years to attract people who have worked in the Washington bureaucracy and seem to prefer the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We had people leaving jobs with the C.I.A. and military intelligence to come work for us,'' Mr. Rascoff said. ''Why were they doing that? Part of it was the noir quality of being within the confines of an institution like the N.Y.P.D. There is an emotional, even an aesthetic, immediacy in being in New York rather than sitting in a cubicle in some fluorescent-lit office in Langley.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Mr. Silber, the attraction is the opportunity to work at street level on terrorism cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, analysts used their knowledge of cultural and political trends in Somalia to help prepare an undercover officer in his dealings with two New Jersey men, Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, arrested in June just before they traveled to Somalia to join Al Shabab, a group that claims kinship with Al Qaeda. Last year, an analyst provided unique advice to detectives investigating Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan immigrant who has pleaded guilty in a plot to detonate a bomb on the subway. The analyst, who served in Afghanistan with the elite Army Rangers, drew upon his knowledge of local tribes in Waziristan to create a flow chart of the numerous suspects in the Zazi case, highlighting those that shared hometowns and family affiliations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zazi case, Mr. Silber said, was the largest surveillance effort the Police Department ever mounted in a terrorism investigation, and the unit's analysts worked around the clock at covert locations, debriefing detectives as they came in off the street, then analyzing and sharing the information with the next shift before it went into the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're very much in the weeds of investigations,'' Mr. Silber said. ''We're looking at the threat to New York, in New York, so there's a feeling of grittiness in a sense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that working in Washington, where the focus is often on events and people thousands of miles away, can feel ''a little antiseptic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Here we're all in the same domain -- the suspects and the analysts,'' he said. ''You might hear that yesterday, at 3 o'clock, people gathered at this street corner or in this cafe. We're all in the same fishbowl together. It makes for an odd, exciting dynamic.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- Two separate airstrikes killed more than 70 Taliban insurgents on Saturday, NATO officials said, although some local residents said that civilians were among the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In eastern Laghman Province, a combined force of Afghan and coalition soldiers airlifted troops into the Masooda village in the Alishing district to clear the area of insurgents, the international forces said in a statement. After coming under fire, they called for air support, and 32 insurgents were killed, according to Afghan police officials. NATO officials separately put the death toll at ''more than 30.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hours after the early-morning engagement, according to the provincial police chief, Ghulam Aziz, a group of more than 100 local residents held an angry demonstration in Mihtarlam, the capital of the province, and police dispersed them with fire hoses and gunshots in the air.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was not really a protest,'' Mr. Aziz said. ''It was actually an insurrection by some elements who want to disrupt security.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujaheed, interviewed by cellphone, said that there had been no Taliban activity in the area and that all the victims were civilians. A spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, Maj. Michael Johnson, said that ''as of right now we have no indication of any civilian casualties.'' The operation in Laghman Province was ongoing, Major Johnson said, and, ''If there's any indication at all of civilian casualties, we will investigate it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other encounter, in eastern Khost Province, 42 insurgents were killed at about 2 a.m. on Saturday when they were spotted trying to cross the border from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Maj. Stephen Platt, a NATO spokesman at Forward Operating Base Salerno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Khost provincial police chief, Gen. Abdul Hakim Isahqzai, put the insurgent death toll even higher, with at least 82 killed in a NATO airstrike and reports that the final toll may reach 200. A But a NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. John Dorrian, said there were no airstrikes by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, in that area. He had no information on who might have carried out such a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no complaints of civilian casualties in that encounter, in the Mogholgai region of the Gurboz district, where airstrikes have also been carried out by other United States government agencies, including those by C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Isahqzai also said that the police had arrested a major Taliban commander, Mollawi Salim, from Logar Province, at a checkpoint in Khost, and handed him over to American soldiers at the Salerno operating base for detention. The police general said that Mr. Salim was a well-known figure who was responsible for arranging suicide bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISAF reported on Saturday the earlier arrests and killings of four other insurgent commanders in three different provinces, Khost, Paktika and Helmand, part of the military's ongoing campaign to focus on midlevel leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international security force also reported the deaths of two NATO soldiers by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, and that of another NATO soldier killed in a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of War Memoir Destroyed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department has confirmed that it has destroyed 9,500 copies of an Afghan war memoir by a former intelligence officer to prevent the disclosure of what it considered to be classified information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pentagon spokeswoman said Friday that on Monday, department officials had observed the destruction of the books, the uncensored first printing of Anthony Shaffer's ''Operation Dark Heart,'' the spokeswoman said. A second printing, with about 250 passages blacked out, went on sale Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the negotiations said that the Pentagon had paid St. Martin's Press about $5 a book, for a cost to taxpayers of nearly $50,000. Publishing executives say they think it is the first time the government has destroyed a print run of a book to protect secrets. About 100 uncensored advance copies of ''Operation Dark Heart'' were distributed before the Pentagon intervened, and some have sold online for as much as $2,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The C.I.A. has drastically increased its bombing campaign in the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks, American officials said. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are part of an effort by military and intelligence operatives to try to cripple the Taliban in a stronghold being used to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its covert war in the region, the C.I.A. has launched 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft thus far in September, the most ever during a single month, and more than twice the number in a typical month. This expanded air campaign comes as top officials are racing to stem the rise of American casualties before the Obama administration's comprehensive review of its Afghanistan strategy set for December. American and European officials are also evaluating reports of possible terrorist plots in the West from militants based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also reflect mounting frustration both in Afghanistan and the United States that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government has not been aggressive enough in dislodging militants from their bases in the country's western mountains. In particular, the officials said, the Americans believe the Pakistanis are unlikely to launch military operations inside North Waziristan, a haven for Taliban and Qaeda operatives that has long been used as a base for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the war in the region is escalating in other ways. In recent days, American military helicopters have launched three airstrikes into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that military officials estimate killed more than 50 people suspected of being members of the militant group known as the Haqqani network, which is responsible for a spate of deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such air raids by the military remain rare, and officials in Kabul said Monday that the helicopters entered Pakistani airspace on only one of the three raids, and acted in self-defense after militants fired rockets at an allied base just across the border in Afghanistan. At the same time, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> point to a new willingness by military officials to expand the boundaries of the campaign against the Taliban and Haqqani network -- and to an acute concern in military and intelligence circles about the limited time to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban strongholds while American ''surge'' forces are in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials have angrily criticized the helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying that NATO's mandate in Afghanistan does not extend across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of the growing frustration of American officials, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Afghanistan, has recently issued veiled warnings to top Pakistani commanders that the United States could launch unilateral ground operations in the tribal areas should </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refuse to dismantle the militant networks in North Waziristan, according to American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Petraeus wants to turn up the heat on the safe havens,'' said one senior administration official, explaining the sharp increase in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''He has pointed out to the Pakistanis that they could do more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Operations commanders have also been updating plans for cross-border raids, which would require approval from President Obama. For now, officials said, it remains unlikely that the United States would make good on such threats to send American troops over the border, given the potential blowback inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that could change, they said, if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based militants were successful in carrying out a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil. American and European intelligence officials in recent days have spoken publicly about growing evidence that militants may be planning a large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Europe, and have bolstered security at a number of European airports and railway stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are all seeing increased activity by a more diverse set of groups and a more diverse set of threats,'' said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano before a Senate panel last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior administration official said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were intended not only to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban and Haqqani fighters, but also to disrupt any plots directed from or supported by extremists in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas that were aimed at targets in Europe. ''The goal is to suppress or disrupt that activity,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20 C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in September represent the most intense bombardment by the spy agency since January, when the C.I.A. carried out 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after a suicide bomber killed seven agency operatives at a remote base in eastern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one Pakistani intelligence official, the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have not killed any senior Taliban or Qaeda leaders. Many senior operatives have already fled North Waziristan, he said, to escape the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all the spy agency has carried out 74 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year, according to the Web site The Long War Journal, which tracks the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A vast majority of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- which usually involve several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> firing multiple missiles or bombs -- have taken place in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has enthusiastically embraced the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, an ambitious and historically unusual war campaign by American spies. According to The Long War Journal, the spy agency in 2009 and 2010 has launched nearly four times as many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as it did during the final year of the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One American official said that the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been aimed at several groups, including the Haqqani network, Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. The United States, he said, hopes to ''keep the pressure on as long as we can.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the C.I.A.'s campaign has also raised concerns that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are fueling anger in the Muslim world. The man who attempted to detonate a truck filled with explosives in Times Square told a judge that the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign was one of the factors that led him to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting with reporters on Monday, General Petraeus indicated that it was new intelligence gathering technology that helped NATO forces locate the militants killed by the helicopter raids against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he said, the military has expanded its fleet of reconnaissance blimps that can hover over hide-outs thought to belong to the Taliban in eastern and southern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence technology, General Petraeus said, has also enabled the expanded campaign of raids by Special Operations commandos against Taliban operatives in those areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- NATO forces in Afghanistan launched two airstrikes against Taliban insurgents on the Pakistani side of the border, killing more than 30 people, military spokesmen confirmed on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airstrikes, which took place last Friday and Saturday, were unusual because they involved piloted aircraft rather than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which are more commonly used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insurgents on the Pakistani side of the border, and which are normally operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesmen for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force initially denied any of its forces had launched the airstrikes, although they were confirmed by Afghan police officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, however, a statement from the international force confirmed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and put the death toll at more than 30. Initially, a base close to the border in Khost Province, known as Combat Outpost Narizah, came under fire from insurgents on Friday. When what the military described as an ''air weapons team'' responded, they came under fire from the insurgents on the Pakistani side of the frontier and returned fire, killing at least 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When two helicopters from the international force returned to the area the next day, they were fired on again from the Pakistani side of the border, and again returned fire, killing several more insurgents, spokesmen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Khost Provincial Police Chief, Gen. Abdul Hakim Isahqzai, put the death toll among the insurgents at 82 or higher. There have been no complaints of civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coalition officials said the cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell within its rules of engagement because the insurgents had attacked them from across the border. The Associated Press reported that a third </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside Pakistani territory was carried out by two NATO helicopters on Monday. Pakistani intelligence officials told The A.P. that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed five militants and wounded nine others. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was reported on Monday to have criticized the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denying American assertions that the United States has an agreement with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorizing so-called ''hot pursuit'' raids a few miles across the border. In a press statement, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Ministry said the mandate of NATO forces in Afghanistan did not extend beyond the border, The A.P. said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States does carry out remotely-piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though unpopular with many Pakistanis, have had the tacit blessing of the Pakistani government since the end of the Bush administration. The latest such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place on Monday, killing two people near the Afghan border, The A.P. said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS -- European and American officials said Wednesday that they had detected a variety of credible threats from terrorist groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and northern Africa targeting European capitals, but said they did not consider an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imminent and described the plots as largely aspirational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American intelligence and counterterrorism officials said they had gathered intelligence pointing to a series of suspected plans linked to Al Qaeda to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''soft targets'' in Britain, France and Germany. The Central Intelligence Agency has this month carried out a record number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, partly to disrupt communications and target insurgents suspected of involvement in planning those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Western official in Europe who is familiar with the intelligence said one suspected plot involved teams of gunmen equipped with small arms who hoped to mount commando-style raids in Europe. Other terrorism experts compared the plan with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two years ago in the Indian city of Mumbai, in which an Islamist terrorist group tied to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spread panic and tied down police and army units for days, but the official who spoke of plans for small-arms </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that comparisons with Mumbai were overdrawn.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior French official said that France was focused mainly on a separate threat from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a North African group that is linked to, but operates separately from, Al Qaeda itself. France has been on edge in recent days after a string of bomb alerts, including two evacuations of the Eiffel Tower and nearby subway stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said, ''Our problem is North Africa; it's A.Q.I.M., and it's unrelated to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether the terrorist threats amount to a new, concerted campaign against European targets, or represent a variety of unconnected plots by terror groups operating in different places and on different time frames. European officials played down the risk of any imminent threat, while saying that they took any reports of terrorist plans seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American official said plans for European </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> among groups operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were at ''varying stages of maturity'' and were at ''a worrisome level.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said they involved either Western operatives trained by Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or pre-existing Qaeda cells in Europe that relied on Qaeda handlers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for guidance and support, or some combination of the two. The official said that American intelligence authorities had identified specific plotters, presumably through communications intercepts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It appears that the concern is of a coordinated plot launched by core A.Q. leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hit soft targets in European cities,'' said Juan C. Zarate, a former senior counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration who is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''Counterterrorism authorities are very worried, but it will be interesting to see how the media coverage impacts this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence officials say most of the information points to plots aimed at targets in Europe, but American officials were monitoring closely any indication that the plots could include the United States. As one senior American counterterrorism official put it, ''It doesn't take much to jump across the ocean.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has received several briefings from John O. Brennan, his senior counterterrorism adviser, as well as from American intelligence officials since the Qaeda plots were first detected several weeks ago, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. Congressional committees have also been briefed on the heightened threat levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The president has received daily -- sometimes several times daily -- updates on threat information,'' the senior official said. ''The president directed that all threat information be shared immediately with appropriate intelligence, security and law enforcement partners, and he has specifically asked the counterterrorism community to advise him if they need anything to deal with the current terrorist threat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to media coverage, James R. Clapper Jr., who became director of national intelligence last month, issued this statement on Tuesday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies. As we have repeatedly said, we know A.Q. wants to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Europe and the United States. We continue to work closely with our European allies on the threat from international terrorism, including Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German government said in a statement from the Interior Ministry that it was aware of Al Qaeda's ''long-term'' aim to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western targets, but that ''at present there are no concrete pointers to imminent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Germany stemming from this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French officials say they are mainly focused on threats from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that stem from a separate stream of intelligence. Tensions have been high generally since the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, and on Sept. 15, five French citizens, along with two African colleagues, were kidnapped by the Qaeda-linked group in a uranium-mining region of Niger, in central Africa, where six of them were working for French companies. The seventh hostage is married to one of the employees. The French believe the hostages are alive and being held in northwestern Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German intelligence officials say that some of the latest reports are related to the interrogation of a German of Afghan origin captured in Afghanistan in July. The German, said to be named Ahmed Sidiqi, 36, from Hamburg, had traveled to Waziristan, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and received firearms and explosives training. He told American interrogators in Afghanistan about plans for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a network of small armed groups in European cities, a senior European official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sidiqi said some of the potential attackers might already be in Europe, according to the official, and Mr. Sidiqi mentioned the Haqqani network in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as being involved in the plot. The network is allied with the Taliban and Al Qaeda and has been a target of some recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another French official speculated that the leak of Washington's concerns about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Europe by the Pakistani Qaeda and the Taliban was meant to justify the increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on targets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to press </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use ground troops more aggressively in the tribal areas and even to prepare the way for using American ground forces, covert or otherwise, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the C.I.A. has escalated its bombing campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. American officials said the intense bombardment in the tribal areas was intended to keep militant groups from sending operatives across the border into Afghanistan to replenish Taliban ranks, as well as to disrupt any communications between Pakistani militants and operatives who might be placed in Europe. American officials said it was unclear what impact, if any, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have on a terrorism plot that might be carried out in Europe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Faisal Shahzad planted a car bomb in Times Square, he returned to his home in Connecticut and contacted the Pakistani Taliban via computer, telling one of his handlers what he had done, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shahzad later told the authorities that he believed that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on May 1 would kill at least 40 people, having monitored his target for three months through live video feeds on the Internet, to determine which areas drew the largest crowds and when they would be busiest, the prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shahzad's goal was to ''maximize the deadly effect of his bomb,'' the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, told a judge in a new court filing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bharara's office also revealed that Mr. Shahzad told the authorities after his arrest on May 3 that he planned to detonate a second bomb in New York City two weeks later, and was prepared to conduct more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until he was captured or killed, the document shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the filing, prosecutors asked the judge, Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of Federal District Court, to impose a mandatory term of life imprisonment on Mr. Shahzad, who is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday. ''The premeditated attempt to kill and maim scores of unsuspecting innocent men, women and children with a homemade bomb can only be described as utterly reprehensible,'' the prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known that the Pakistani Taliban helped to develop and finance Mr. Shahzad's bombing plot, but the court filing offers new details about how he communicated with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that in the period leading up to the bombing attempt, Mr. Shahzad stayed in regular contact with the Taliban over the Internet, using software programs the Taliban installed on his laptop computer while he was training with them in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The programs were not identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He communicated with his Taliban associates about the bomb he was building and the Nissan Pathfinder he had bought, as well as other topics, the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum does not reveal precisely what he told the Taliban the night of his failed attempt, but the communications support Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s assertion last June that ''the Pakistani Taliban facilitated Faisal Shahzad's attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shahzad a former financial analyst who was raised in a military family in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Bridgeport, pleaded guilty to 10 counts in June, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, he told Judge Cedarbaum that he spent 40 days with the Taliban in Waziristan last December and January, and received five days of bomb training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was there that he developed his plot with the Taliban, he told her, saying, ''I made a pact with them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wanted to plead guilty ''100 times,'' citing American military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other issues. ''We will be attacking U.S.,'' he added, ''and I plead guilty to that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer for Mr. Shahzad, Philip L. Weinstein, had no comment on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its filing, the government also revealed that during Mr. Shahzad's cooperation with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and police detectives after his arrest, he ''never expressed any remorse for his conduct.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said he spoke with pride about what he and his co-conspirators had done, much as he did in court when he pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of their filing, prosecutors also released a video of a controlled detonation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force last June 29 of a bomb that was built to be ''identical to Shahzad's bomb in all respects'' -- except that the task force bomb technicians ensured that their device would work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force placed its bomb in the back of a vehicle identical to the Nissan Pathfinder that Mr. Shahzad used, and parked other vehicles nearby in order to measure the explosive effects on them, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While it is impossible to calculate precisely the impact of Shahzad's bomb had it detonated,'' prosecutors wrote, ''the controlled detonation conducted by the J.T.T.F. demonstrated that those effects would have been devastating to the surrounding area.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also made public a video produced by the Taliban, in which Mr. Shahzad appeared and which was later released on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video depicts Mr. Shahzad firing a machine gun in what appears to be the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, prosecutors said. He announces that he has met leaders of the Pakistani Taliban, and that ''we have decided that we are going to arrange an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have been trying to join my brothers in jihad ever since 9/11 happened,'' he is shown saying later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In citing the video, prosecutors said Mr. Shahzad, despite a life ''full of promise'' with his wife and two young children, had chosen instead a ''nihilistic path that celebrated conflict and death cloaked in the rhetoric of a distorted interpretation of Islam.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- American officials pressed their Pakistani counterparts on Thursday to reopen a vital supply route for American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, as relations deteriorated after the fourth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by coalition helicopters in a week killed three members of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angrily closed the crossing to protest the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its side of the border, leaving American officials to use meetings and phone calls to try to soothe relations and get the route reopened. Both sides indicated that they might be able to resolve the dispute with a joint investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the border closing, and the exceptional series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by piloted aircraft, as opposed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, signaled a general increase in tensions between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, already uncomfortable allies that are pursuing competing interests in the Afghan war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. carried out a record number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month, and new reports surfaced this week of unlawful executions by the Pakistani Army in areas where it has opened operations against Taliban forces threatening the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani offensives have not extended to North Waziristan, the prime stronghold of the insurgents who infiltrate Afghanistan, a growing source of frustration for American officials who face a deadline this year to show progress in the Afghan war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are clearly in the phase of our relationship where we're trying to tell them we're being diddled,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she added: ''We have been trying for a couple of years to decrease our logistical dependence on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and have only managed to get it to 80 percent from 90 percent. So, no, we clearly don't have anyplace else to go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The border closing was a clear demonstration of the leverage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holds over the American war effort. It coincided with a previously scheduled visit by the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, who met Thursday with the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, part of a stream of American officials who have come to alternately cajole and coerce Pakistani cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, unidentified assailants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked and set fire to tankers carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan, officials told Reuters, apparently in retaliation for the incursions into Pakistani territory. No one was wounded, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the border closing on Thursday, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, trying to calm the tensions. That conversation followed a telephone call several days ago between Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kayani, about the previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The border closing signaled the limits of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tolerance for intrusions on its sovereignty and for the pressure it was willing to absorb from American officials on any range of issues, despite receiving nearly $2 billion a year in military aid from Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani government indicated Thursday that the cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were more than it could bear without protest. ''We will have to see whether we are allies or enemies,'' said the Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Pakistani officials tried to contain the damage from a video that came to the attention of American officials in recent days showing the execution of six young men, bound and blindfolded, by Pakistani Army soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to questions from American officials, Pakistani officials acknowledged Thursday that the video had not been faked, as they had first contended, an American official said, and that they had identified the soldiers and would take appropriate measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in both the American and the Pakistani interests to keep the relationship going, the official said. The Pakistanis, facing economic collapse after the devastating floods of the summer, need American military aid -- some $10 billion since 2001 -- which could be cut off from units committing atrocities, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American commanders are eager to continue C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas that have focused on militants from the Taliban and Al Qaeda who cross the border to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO and American troops. The Pakistani government has agreed to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, but could always suspend its permission or shrink the area in which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is also the prime supply route for the Afghan war, a fact Pakistani and American officials are both keenly aware of. The vast majority of nonlethal supplies -- water, food, vehicles -- for the coalition forces in landlocked Afghanistan must travel the length of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, from the southern port of Karachi to the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along that route, trucks and fuel tankers have at times been hijacked and attacked by Taliban forces. Pakistani authorities have closed the border crossings only occasionally, however, usually citing security concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they have rarely appeared to hold up supplies in retaliation for NATO or American actions. In 2008, the Pakistanis closed the border crossing for several days after American aircraft bombed a Pakistani paramilitary post in Mohmand, another tribal area. Eleven Pakistanis were killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American commanders in Afghanistan, long fearful that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could choke off the supply route more permanently, have been seeking alternate paths through Central Asia, but with little success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Pakistani officials gave them a glimpse of how much harder they could make the Afghan war. Trucks and oil tankers bound for coalition forces sat idle at the border post of Torkham, just north of Peshawar, with no word on when the post, one of two major land crossings to Afghanistan, would reopen, a Pakistani security official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But American officials noted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had shut only one of several supply routes to Afghanistan, a sign that the Pakistani government wanted to minimize the episode's fallout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have many different capabilities, routes, ways to resupply, so there's no immediate impact,'' Col. Dave Lapan told reporters in Washington. The blocked route, the Khyber Pass, connects the frontier city of Peshawar to Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Lapan said American military officials were also looking into whether all procedures had been followed properly in the cross-border incidents. The Pakistani government took no similar action and made no such public protest after the earlier coalition airstrikes, even though they killed an estimated 55 people inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sept. 24 and Sept. 25, took place on the border separating Khost Province in Afghanistan from North Waziristan. Coalition helicopters fired into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> three times, with one helicopter briefly breaching Pakistani airspace, according to Maj. Sunset Belinsky, a NATO spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the airstrike on Thursday, a NATO helicopter attacked a border post at Mandati Kandaw, a town close to Parachinar, in the Kurram tribal area, the Pakistani security official said. Three soldiers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frontier Corps were killed and three were wounded, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another border post, at Kharlachi, also in Kurram, was struck a few hours later, the official added. The two posts are about 15 miles apart and border Paktia Province, in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency killed several militants with German citizenship in the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday, according to Pakistani and American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were part of an escalating barrage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the C.I.A. over the past month, and come amid tension in European capitals over the possibility that operatives of Al Qaeda who are based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Africa might be planning terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> somewhere on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small stream of German Muslims has traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mountainous tribal areas in recent years, part of what some European counterterrorism officials see as Al Qaeda's effort to recruit young Westerners who might be able to return to Europe or the United States to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday were related to the suspected terrorist plots in Europe. News organizations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported that missiles struck a mosque in Mir Ali, a town in North Waziristan, the region where most of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have occurred this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials offered few details about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday, and there were conflicting reports about the number of German militants killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Pakistani official said 10 to 12 people were killed, at least four of them German.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, it takes the C.I.A several days to analyze communication intercepts and other information to confirm the identities of those killed in airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the State Department issued a vague travel alert to Americans in Europe, warning of threats to ''tourist infrastructure,'' but not mentioning any specific countries that might be at risk. Over the past week, American officials have said they were gathering intelligence about multiple plots that could involve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in France, Germany and Britain like those two years ago in Mumbai, India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's top security official, Thomas de Maiziere, on Monday played down concern that Al Qaeda was plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against some of Berlin's landmarks. ''There is no concrete indication of impending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Mr. de Maiziere said in a short news conference in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Maiziere, the interior minister, spoke Sunday night with Janet Napolitano, the United States secretary of homeland security, to discuss the American travel alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security in Berlin has increased around government ministry buildings and political parties' headquarters and at the airport and major railway stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years American and European intelligence officials have grown concerned about groups of young men from Germany and Britain who have been training in militant camps in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German security officials think this trend has been inspired in part by a proliferation of radical German-language videos on the Internet, including some made by a group called the German Taliban Mujahedeen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have said that the exact number of Germans traveling to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hard to determine because of the route that many Germans take: leaving the country by car to elude airport security and then traveling to Turkey and ultimately Iran, where smugglers take them to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. carried out 21 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in September, the most in one month, and has already carried out several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in October. American officials said the escalation was the result of two factors: an attempt to disrupt militant networks that attacked American troops in Afghanistan, and efforts to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militant cells in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that might be coordinating terrorist plots in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have occurred in North Waziristan, a region abutting the Afghan border that has become a safe haven for Qaeda militants and operatives of the Haqqani network, a group responsible for a wave of violence in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials have tried to press </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military to begin an offensive in North Waziristan, but the government has resisted, citing strained resources from military operations elsewhere in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Dozens of tanker trucks carrying fuel to Afghanistan for NATO troops were torched near Quetta in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, the third major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on supplies since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> closed a border crossing to Afghanistan a week ago and the first at the only checkpoint that remained open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest sabotage came as American officials for the first time offered an explicit apology to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over a shooting that led to the closing of the other border crossing, possibly laying the ground work for its reopening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was killed in the Quetta torchings after three carloads of gunmen fired at the tankers and then burned them, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''According to eyewitnesses and initial reports some terrorists came on vehicles a few minutes before morning prayer and started firing and then burned some of the tankers,'' said Hamid Shakeel, the deputy inspector general of the Quetta police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40 tanker trucks were at the terminal, and about half were saved from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inspector Shakeel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firefighters struggled to contain the blaze. Live television showed the fire raging hours after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't have foam to put out the fire,'' the police official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the trucks at Quetta, Taliban militants claimed responsibility, according to reports on Pakistani television channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that the government was continuing to distance itself from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the police chief in Quetta, Malik Muhammad Iqbal said it was not the responsibility of the government to provide security for the convoys. In the past few days, senior police officers have said the safety of the trucks lay with the fleet owners who had signed contracts with NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standoff between the government and NATO continued on Wednesday with no definitive word from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about when the border at Torkham in the Khyber region would be reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That crossing was closed last week in protest over NATO helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a mountainous border post at Khurram manned by Pakistani paramilitary soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a sign of possible movement, NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said a joint assessment with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed that NATO helicopter crews had shot at Pakistani border forces in the Sept. 30 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thinking that they were responding to enemy fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement was notable in that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander, said, ''We deeply regret this tragic loss of life and will continue to work with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and government to ensure this doesn't happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An even more explicit apology was offered by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the United States ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Anne W. Patterson. ''We extend our deepest apology to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the families of the Frontier scouts who were killed and injured'' Ms. Patterson said. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brave security forces are our allies in a war that threatens both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately unclear if the statements would appease </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. An escalated campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the United States has also stirred anger there. On Wednesday, news reports from northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that that six militants had been killed after two missiles thought to be fired from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struck a house in North Waziristan. Unknown assailants, never identified or captured by the police, have attacked and torched NATO oil tankers three times since the border closure and there have been several other, less severe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the convoys. The route is a vital supply line for NATO to carry nonlethal equipment such as food, clothing and vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second crossing at Chaman, near Quetta, where the tankers were attacked Wednesday morning, has remained open in the past week. The closure of the Torkham crossing has been used by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to demonstrate its leverage over the NATO supply route that courses from the port of Karachi to the Khyber region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration scrambled to halt a sharp deterioration in its troubled relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, offering Pakistani officials multiple apologies for a helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a border post that killed three Pakistani soldiers last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as the White House tried to mollify </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, officials acknowledged that the uneasy allies faced looming tensions over a host of issues far larger than the airstrike and the subsequent closing of supply lines into Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American pressure to show progress in Afghanistan is translating into increased pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to crack down on terrorist groups. It is also running up against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sensitivity about its sovereignty and its determination to play a crucial role in any reconciliation with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American and NATO officials said privately that the Pakistani government's closing of a crucial border crossing might have made it easier for militants to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backed-up tanker trucks carrying fuel through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Afghanistan to support the American war effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the unusual apologies, officials and outside analysts said, were intended to clear away the debris from the explosive events along the border, in hopes of maintaining Pakistani cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have historically had astonishing sources of resilience in our relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Teresita Schaffer, a South Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''One should not too quickly assume we're in a breakpoint. But having said that, the time we're in right now, the intensity of anti-American feeling, the antipathy of militants, all of these things make new crises a little more complicated to get through than the old ones were.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall commander of forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, has been pulling out all the stops -- aggressively using the American troop buildup, greatly expanding Special Operations raids (as many as a dozen commando raids a night) and pressing the Central Intelligence Agency to ramp up Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also, through the not-so-veiled threat of cross-border ground operations, put pressure on the Pakistani Army to pursue militants in the tribal areas even as the army has continued to struggle with relief from the catastrophic floods this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fragility of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- and the tentativeness of the alliance -- were underscored in a White House report to Congress this week, which sharply criticized the Pakistani military effort against Al Qaeda and other insurgents and noted the ineffectiveness of its civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials lined up to placate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on intrusions of its sovereignty. General Petraeus offered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the most explicit American mea culpa yet for the cross-border helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying that the American-led coalition forces ''deeply regret'' the ''tragic loss of life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne W. Patterson, the American ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, quickly followed suit, calling ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brave security forces'' an important ally in the war. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered a private, but official, apology to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in a telephone call on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both American and Pakistani officials said that they expected that Wednesday's apologies would be effective, at least in the short term, and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would soon reopen the border crossing at Torkham, a supply route for the NATO coalition in landlocked Afghanistan that runs from the port of Karachi to the Khyber region. The Pakistani government closed that route last week to protest the cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's obvious that the situation right now ain't good,'' said a senior NATO official, who agreed to speak candidly but only anonymously. ''The best thing we could do is to strip away as many of the relatively smaller things as possible so we can focus on the big issues. And crazy as it may seem, the border crossing is a relatively small issue, compared to the others.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those other issues were flagged in the latest quarterly report from the White House to Congress on developments in the region. The assessment, first reported in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, takes aim at both the Pakistani military and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, ''the Pakistani military continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with Afghan Taliban or Al Qaeda forces in North Waziristan,'' the report said. It also painted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, as out of touch with his own populace, a disconnect that the report said was exacerbated by Mr. Zardari's ''decision to travel to Europe despite the floods.'' The overall Pakistani response to the catastrophic floods this summer, the report said, was viewed by Pakistanis as ''slow and inadequate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustration with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is growing in the United States in part because ''we're living in the post-Faisal Shahzad era,'' said Daniel Markey of the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to the Pakistani-American who was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday for the attempted Times Square bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Markey said that tensions among counterterrorism officials had also mounted because of the unspecified threats of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Europe. ''Frustration has really mounted, so the drumbeat is getting louder,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making things worse, the administration is expected to brief Congressional officials on an Internet video, which surfaced last week, that showed men in Pakistani military uniforms executing six young men in civilian clothes, underscoring concerns about unlawful killings by Pakistani soldiers supported by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent House Democrat warned on Wednesday that American aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be imperiled. ''I am appalled by the horrific contents of the recent video, which appears to show extrajudicial killings by the Pakistani military,'' Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The failure of Pakistani officials to punish those responsible could have implications for future security assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-NATO inquiry on the helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concluded on Wednesday that Pakistani border soldiers who initially fired on NATO helicopters were ''simply firing warning shots after hearing the nearby engagement and hearing the helicopters flying nearby,'' said Brig. Gen. Timothy M. Zadalis, a NATO spokesman, in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This tragic event could have been avoided with better coalition force coordination with the Pakistani military,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

We are the mightiest nation mankind has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can't seem to build a railroad tunnel to carry commuters between New Jersey and New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is not just losing its capacity to do great things. It's losing its soul. It's speeding down an increasingly rubble-strewn path to a region where being second rate is good enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The railroad tunnel was the kind of infrastructure project that used to get done in the United States almost as a matter of routine. It was a big and expensive project, but the payoff would have been huge. It would have reduced congestion and pollution in the New York-New Jersey corridor. It would have generated economic activity and put thousands of people to work. It would have enabled twice as many passengers to ride the trains on that heavily traveled route between the two states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project had been in the works for 20 years, and ground had already been broken when the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, rejected the project on Thursday, saying that his state could not afford its share of the costs. Extreme pressure is being exerted from federal officials and others to get Mr. Christie to change his mind, but, as of now, the project is a no-go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a railroad tunnel we're talking about. We're not trying to go to the Moon. This is not the Manhattan Project. It's a railroad tunnel that's needed to take people back and forth to work and to ease the pressure on the existing tunnel, a wilting two-track facility that's about 100 years old. What is the matter with us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese could build it. The Turks could build it. We can't build it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day after Governor Christie made his devastating announcement about the tunnel, the U.S. Labor Department released its latest unemployment statistics. They show that the nation remains locked in an employment crisis, unable to provide work for millions who want and need it. One of the major potential solutions to this crisis is all around us. America's infrastructure is indisputably in sorry shape, and upgrading it to meet the needs of the 21st century is far and away the best strategy for putting people back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The railroad tunnel project, all set and ready to go, would have provided jobs for 6,000 construction workers, not to mention all the residual employment that accompanies such projects. What we'll get instead, if it is not built, is the increased pollution and worsening traffic jams that result when tens of thousands of commuters who would have preferred to take the train are redirected to their automobiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is government policy at its pathetic worst. But it's not the first policy disaster of Mr. Christie's short tenure as governor. He blew a golden opportunity (along with $400 million in federal funds) to participate in the Obama administration's Race to the Top competition to improve the nation's public school systems. New Jersey's bid came up needlessly and embarrassingly short because of a mistake in the application and the governor's refusal to sign off on an agreement that had been reached with the teachers' union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This failure to take part in a nationwide initiative to bolster public education comes at a time when the United States, once the world's leader in the percentage of young people with college degrees, has fallen to a humiliating 12th place among 36 developed nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can accuse the governor of New Jersey of being a visionary. But his stumbling and bumbling and his inability to chart a clear path to a better future is, frankly, just the latest example of the dismal leadership that Americans have endured for many years. Where once we were the innovators, the pathfinders, the model for the rest of the world, now we just can't seem to get it done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't put the population to work, or get the kids through college, or raise the living standards of the middle class and the poor. We can't rebuild the infrastructure or curb our destructive overreliance on fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been many times when the U.S. has stunned the world with the breadth and greatness of its achievements -- the Marshall Plan, the G.I. Bill, the world's highest standard of living, the world's finest higher education system, the space program, and on and on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhere, somehow, things went haywire. The nation that built the Erie Canal and Hoover Dam and the transcontinental railroad can't even build a tunnel beneath the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has sharply expanded the shadow war against terrorists, using both the military and the C.I.A. to track down and kill hundreds of them, in a dozen countries, on and off the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program has been effective, killing more than 400 Al Qaeda militants this year alone, according to American officials, but fewer than 10 noncombatants. But assassinations are a grave act and subject to abuse -- and imitation by other countries. The government needs to do a better job of showing the world that it is acting in strict compliance with international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has the right under international law to try to prevent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being planned by terrorists connected to Al Qaeda, up to and including killing the plotters. But it is not within the power of a commander in chief to simply declare anyone anywhere a combatant and kill them, without the slightest advance independent oversight. The authorization for military force approved by Congress a week after 9/11 empowers the president to go after only those groups or countries that committed or aided the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bush administration's distortion of that mandate led to abuses that harmed the United States around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of who can be targeted applies directly to the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen hiding in Yemen, who officials have admitted is on an assassination list. Did he inspire through words the Army psychiatrist who shot up Fort Hood, Tex., last November, and the Nigerian man who tried to blow up an airliner on Christmas? Or did he actively participate in those plots, and others? The difference is crucial. If the United States starts killing every Islamic radical who has called for jihad, there will be no end to the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials insist that Mr. Awlaki is involved with actual terror plots. But human rights lawyers working on his behalf say that is not the case, and have filed suit to get him off the target list. The administration wants the case thrown out on state-secrets grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration needs to go out of its way to demonstrate that it is keeping its promise to do things differently than the Bush administration did. It must explain how targets are chosen, demonstrate that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are limited and are a last resort, and allow independent authorities to oversee the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUBLIC GUIDELINES The administration keeps secret its standards for putting people on terrorist or assassination lists. In March, Harold Koh, legal adviser to the State Department, said the government adheres to international law, attacking only military targets and keeping civilian casualties to an absolute minimum. ''Our procedures and practices for identifying lawful targets are extremely robust,'' he said in a speech, without describing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, government officials say no C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes place without the approval of the United States ambassador to the target country, the chief of the C.I.A. station, a deputy at the agency, and the agency's director. So far, President Obama's system of command seems to have prevented any serious abuses, but the approval process is entirely within the administration. After the abuses under President Bush, the world is not going to accept a simple ''trust us'' from the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been too many innocent people rounded up for detention and subjected to torture, too many cases of mistaken identity or trumped-up connections to terror. Unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eliminate the element of risk to American forces and make it seductively easy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government needs to make public its guidelines for determining who is a terrorist and who can be targeted for death. It should clearly describe how it follows international law in these cases and list the internal procedures and checks it uses before a killing is approved. That can be done without formally acknowledging the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are taking place in specific countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIMIT TARGETS The administration should state that it is following international law by acting strictly in self-defense, targeting only people who are actively planning or participating in terror, or who are leaders of Al Qaeda or the Taliban -- not those who raise funds for terror groups, or who exhort others to acts of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special measures are taken before an American citizen is added to the terrorist list, officials say, requiring the approval of lawyers from the National Security Council and the Justice Department. But again, those measures have not been made public. Doing so would help ensure that people like Mr. Awlaki are being targeted for terrorist actions, not their beliefs or associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A LAST RESORT Assassination should in every case be a last resort. Before a decision is made to kill, particularly in areas away from recognized battlefields, the government needs to consider every other possibility for capturing the target short of lethal force. Terrorists operating on American soil should be captured using police methods, and not subject to assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If practical, the United States should get permission from a foreign government before carrying out an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its soil. The government is reluctant to discuss any of these issues publicly, in part to preserve the official fiction that the United States is not waging a formal war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and elsewhere, but it would not harm that effort to show the world how seriously it takes international law by making clear its limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT Dealing out death requires additional oversight outside the administration. Particularly in the case of American citizens, like Mr. Awlaki, the government needs to employ some due process before depriving someone of life. It would be logistically impossible to conduct a full-blown trial in absentia of every assassination target, as the lawyers for Mr. Awlaki prefer. But judicial review could still be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government could establish a court like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which authorizes wiretaps on foreign agents inside the United States. Before it adds people to its target list and begins tracking them, the government could take its evidence to this court behind closed doors -- along with proof of its compliance with international law -- and get the equivalent of a judicial warrant in a timely and efficient way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional leaders are secretly briefed on each C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and say they are satisfied with the information they get and with the process. Nonetheless, that process is informal and could be changed at any time by this president or his successors. Formal oversight is a better way of demonstrating confidence in American methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-defense under international law not only shows the nation's resolve and power, but sends a powerful message to other countries that the United States couples drastic action with careful judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another crisis is roiling American-Pakistani relations after NATO helicopters mistakenly fired on a border post and killed Pakistani soldiers last month. Islamabad then closed a major supply line for NATO troops in Afghanistan; last week, extremists torched fuel trucks waiting at the border crossing. A new White House report said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army is refusing to go after Taliban groups targeting American forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a joint </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-NATO inquiry concluded last week that the Pakistani troops were ''simply firing warning shots'' when the Afghan-based helicopters crossed the border, the United States apologized. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has since reopened the crossing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, making this alliance work is essential. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government is unraveling in the wake of its incompetent response to devastating floods. The United States needs to do more to help -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and civilian leaders finally need to admit that winning the battle against extremists, on both sides of the border, is essential to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security. The agenda is daunting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RELIEF The government's incompetence after the floods has stoked public outrage. Even the Army -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> best-functioning institution -- has been overwhelmed. The United States is the largest donor of emergency aid, more than $450 million so far, and American troops rescued at least 21,000 Pakistanis. Millions of people are still at risk. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army needs more help, it should ask -- and publicize American cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECONSTRUCTION Devastation is vast: twenty million people were displaced and countless bridges, roads, schools and farms were swept away. It will take decades and billions of dollars to rebuild. Donor nations were already tired after Haiti, but there is an antipathy toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that should give its government serious pause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many donors -- starting with China, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> longtime ally -- must do more. The Obama administration is rightly telling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that it must invest in its recovery by finally taxing wealthy citizens. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could also shift funds from its nuclear program. A transparent commission to receive and manage contributions would help rally donors, as would working closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICAN AID In addition to billions of dollars in military aid, Congress last year approved a five-year, $7.5 billion aid package for schools, hospitals and energy plants. Since the floods, Washington has shifted some of that money to recovery efforts. It will have to shift more. Washington needs to move quickly on some high-visibility projects so Pakistanis can see that they are not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOVERNMENT REFORM </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, last month reportedly warned President Asif Ali Zardari that the country is on the verge of economic collapse and insisted on a government shakeup. So far, the generals say they don't want to take over -- and a coup would be disastrous. But the argument for reform is undeniable. Washington can, quietly, help the Pakistanis think it through. Any changes must be done transparently and within the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DRONE STRIKES</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent weeks, the C.I.A. has stepped up its bombing campaign against Taliban strongholds on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border. The American oversight system for these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is deeply inadequate, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leadership needs to understand that if they won't go after insurgents targeting American troops, then the United States military will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama visits India next month, he must quietly urge its government to revive peace talks with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That may be the best hope of getting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military to focus on fighting the insurgency. Next week, senior Pakistani and American officials will hold the latest in a series of ''strategic dialogues.'' They have a lot to talk about.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAMBURG, Germany -- This wealthy port city advertises its bustling canals and bridges and its towering 19th-century churches to draw visitors from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is less interested in drawing more attention to Al Quds Mosque, where the Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta prayed and which has become a destination for jihadi tourism. This summer, local authorities closed the mosque, since renamed Taiba Mosque, altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Germany has been spared the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have hit the United States, Britain and Spain, Hamburg -- and Germany in general -- remains a breeding ground for Islamic radicals, security officials acknowledge. A spate of recent arrests and terrorism warnings in Europe and Afghanistan has underscored the risk that a small number of German citizens are under the sway of terrorist groups determined to stage new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> either in Germany or elsewhere in Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Hamburg emphasized that the vast majority of its Muslim population -- which they put at 130,000 -- rejected violence. But a Hamburg intelligence official said there were 2,000 residents who embrace radical ideology and another 45 who accept the ideology of Al Qaeda and global jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's what we all experience in America and in other countries and also here, that this phenomenon of the homegrown terrorist increases rapidly,'' said the intelligence official, who spoke recently on the condition that he not be identified because of the secrecy of his work. ''This is an extremism which grows right here. The recruiting, the radicalization happens right here, not in other countries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent events have put German citizens at the center of the global terrorism scare. In July, American forces in Afghanistan detained a German citizen, Ahmed Sidiqi, 36, said to have ties to the men who helped plot the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then just after Washington issued the terrorism alert based on information from Mr. Sidiqi, Pakistani officials said that several German citizens were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States military also recently issued an alert for a 23-year-old Berlin man suspected of joining a group called the German Taliban Mujahadeen. Federal law enforcement authorities here followed suit with an arrest warrant for the man identified as Hayrettin Burhan Sauerland amid concerns that he might try to return here from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Afghanistan border region to stage an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> possibly against United States military personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German officials said that the alerts did not add up to a specific threat, and that the intentions and capabilities of those arrested remained unclear. They have publicly criticized the decision by the United States to issue a travel alert for its citizens traveling to Europe, saying that such announcements play into the hands of terrorists and scare people needlessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No one should doubt that Germany is a target for terrorists, but on the other hand there are no concrete, immediate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans that we are aware of,'' Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on German radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, the intelligence official in Hamburg said Germany did face the ''intense abstract danger'' of homegrown radical Islamic terrorism. And this week, the Interior Ministry also said it had assigned an additional 200 investigators to focus on terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German officials said that hundreds of their citizens and legal residents had over the years traveled to the lawless border region between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and that more than 100 had returned to Germany. There has been a deluge of statistics coming from Germany's intelligence and police operations illustrating the growing concern of radicalized young people heading off to terrorist training camps -- and then returning home to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported that federal officials identified 131 individuals as possibly prepared to carry out violent acts. The federal security services said that over the last two decades, about 215 citizens or legal residents of Germany received or intended to receive paramilitary training, that 65 completed the training, and that of the total group, about 105 are in Germany, including 15 in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those precise-sounding numbers, however, belie the fact that German officials are struggling to get a handle on how susceptible their large and mostly peaceful population of Muslims is to the lure to radicals in far-off places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These are the so-called known terrorists, the suspicious people,'' said Rolf Tophoven, the director of the Institute for Terrorism Research and Security Policy in Essen, of the statistics. ''But the unknown people, they don't go to the mosque to pray because they are afraid to be detected; they don't have meetings in religious institutions, maybe they come together in a private house. That is a big concern.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany first awoke to this reality in 2001, when three men who worshiped at a Hamburg mosque were identified as leaders in carrying out the Sept. 11 plot including Mr. Atta, who flew one of the planes into the World Trade Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories of that case resurfaced when the American military arrested Mr. Sidiqi, a German citizen of Afghan heritage who once worked at the Hamburg airport. The Hamburg intelligence official that said Mr. Sidiqi had been under surveillance for years and that like Mr. Atta, he had attended Al Quds Mosque in Hamburg. The official said Mr. Sidiqi was also a friend of Mounir el-Motassadeq, who was convicted in 2006 for his role in aiding the Sept. 11 hijackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hamburg official said Mr. Sidiqi was one of 11 Hamburg residents who traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2009 in order to fight on behalf of radical Islamic groups abroad, not at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Hamburg, the decision to close the mosque was made to deny radicals a symbol to rally people to the cause. But the intelligence official and German experts on terrorism also acknowledged that closing the mosque did not get rid of those already radicalized but instead drove them underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is some unrest in the Germany intelligence community that they have overlooked a community of Islamic militants they didn't realize was here inside Germany, an existing group of terrorists, a sleeping cell of terror,'' said Mr. Tophoven, of the Institute for Terrorism Research and Security Policy. ''They are concerned it could exist.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Barrett is the coordinator of the United Nations Al Qaeda-Taliban monitoring team.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPECULATION is growing both inside and outside Afghanistan that the government in Kabul is about to open reconciliation talks with the Taliban. Indeed, Taliban leaders, however hesitantly, are beginning to look at alternatives to fighting. They no doubt realize that a military victory is as remote and as hard to define for them as it appears to be for President Hamid Karzai and his NATO allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is unsurprising. Time, rather than resources or appetite for fighting, is beginning to run out for the Taliban. Until recently, they have argued that they will continue to fight until all foreign troops leave the country. Their other conditions are that certain Taliban prisoners must be freed from detention and that the United Nations Security Council should remove the names of Taliban members from its Qaeda-Taliban sanctions list.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as it becomes increasingly clear that there will be only a limited drawdown of United States troops starting next July, and that the current intense air campaign and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Taliban leaders are likely to continue, waiting until the foreigners leave is no longer such an attractive option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban's command-and-control networks have stood up relatively well since their resurgence in 2006, but the campaign against their senior and middle leadership by American, Afghan and other special forces, aided by a much-improved intelligence picture and supported by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken a huge toll. The Taliban have not just lost many key commanders; the surviving senior leaders are forced to keep out of sight and now rarely travel within Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of face-to-face contact with their subordinates and the enemy is sapping their authority. Taliban leaders have also had to limit their telephone communications for fear of giving away their locations, and have had to find less reliable and efficient ways to discuss strategy and pass orders to the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal connections, which have been essential to the cohesion of the movement, have been broken by the deaths of many mid-ranking commanders and their replacement by younger and lesser-known successors. Regional and local commanders have become more independent and less likely to follow orders that go against their personal interests; for example, in the way that they raise and use money, often keeping it for themselves rather than passing it back to their leaders for redistribution. Following Afghan tradition, local commanders are building independent fiefs that they will be reluctant to relinquish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This disaggregation of the Taliban, who have always been held together more by a common enemy than a shared ideology, may seem like good news for Kabul and Washington, but it also creates some difficulties. The Taliban leaders' weakening position will make it tougher for them to carry through any agreement -- and not just to stop the fighting and ensure observance of a national constitution, but to make a clear break with Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the Taliban's new leaders are being courted by Al Qaeda and other extremists who do not support making a deal with President Karzai. Those in the south and the east of the country are also likely to have links with the Pakistani Taliban and their hard-core affiliates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weakening of the Afghan Taliban also puts time pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which will certainly be involved in any reconciliation process. In addition to dealing with the aftermath of this summer's floods, the Pakistani Army is embroiled in a draining fight with well-armed militants in the tribal areas along the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army urgently needs to tamp down the Pakistani Taliban, and a settlement in Afghanistan would help -- especially if it resulted in more effective control of the Afghan side of the border. Furthermore, while at present there are still senior Afghan Taliban who have longstanding contacts with the Pakistani military and recognize common interests, the younger Taliban leadership that is emerging will be less likely to cooperate with Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders may well support reconciliation, deciding that stability in Afghanistan is more important than angling for the creation of a pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other regional powers, including Iran and Russia, will not want to see a full-fledged return of the Taliban to power, but nonetheless would welcome a settlement. The trade in Afghan-produced drugs has created a huge internal market in Iran, with all the attendant problems of health and crime, and is becoming an increasing problem in Russia. It cannot be stemmed without greater stability in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tehran may delight in America's struggles in the war, but its long-term interest will be to help establish a balance of power in Kabul that provides border security and protects its fellow Shiites in Afghanistan, the Hazara. Russia may also see advantage in a power-sharing agreement, which could limit the opportunity for fundamentalist groups to use Afghanistan as a base to undermine the fragile governments of its Central Asian neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what would negotiations with the Taliban entail? On their prime demand -- the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces -- we can expect some flexibility. Their leaders must understand that a precipitate departure by Western troops would lead to more fighting rather than less, as the ethnic and clan rivalries that have prevented stability for the last 30 years re-emerged. What they really want now is simply an end to aggressive operations. As for taking Taliban members off the sanctions list, they must accept that this will come only as a result of peace, not as an incentive to make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big issue is Al Qaeda: the Taliban will have to agree, and show that they can enforce their agreement, that Al Qaeda will not be able to pursue its terrorist agenda from any part of Afghanistan under their control. Theoretically, this should be possible. The Taliban leadership has said repeatedly that when back in power it will neither interfere itself in the affairs of other states, nor allow anyone to do so from its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Afghan government may need to give ground on a few issues as well. For one, its insistence that the Taliban lay down their arms will probably have to mean just that, rather than that they turn in their weapons. And Kabul's insistence that the Taliban support the Afghan Constitution suggests that parts of it may need to be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban, for all their retrogressive conservatism, are pragmatic Afghans. They have grown up in a culture of negotiation where no one gets everything but no one leaves with nothing. Unlike Al Qaeda, they are a nationalist movement with national objectives, and while they will fight to the last man, they would far prefer to rule. If talks are to begin, let alone succeed, the Taliban will need to show that they are also prepared to govern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced on Wednesday that he would visit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next year for the first time since taking office as his administration tries to bolster rocky relations with perhaps its most important partner in the war against Al Qaeda and its allies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama joined a meeting between his top advisers and visiting Pakistani officials for 45 minutes to discuss mutual issues and assuage concern about his trip to India in November. ''The president explained that he would not be stopping in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during his trip to Asia next month, and committed to visiting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2011,'' the White House said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's meeting came as part of a multiday ''strategic dialogue'' between senior American and Pakistani officials, including the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Relations between the countries have been strained lately after a helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a border post killed several Pakistani soldiers and Islamabad responded by temporarily closing a critical supply line to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against suspected terrorist targets in the Pakistani tribal regions have escalated in recent weeks. At the same time, talks between the Afghan government and Taliban commanders to find a way to end the nine-year-old American-led war have further complicated relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which fears being cut out of any eventual settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings, which continue through Friday, will also address a possible multiyear security pact and flood reconstruction assistance. ''We see this as an opportunity to move beyond the recent period and strengthen our relationship in a number of areas,'' said a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a private meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also met for 90 minutes Wednesday with his national security team to talk about Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The White House statement said they discussed ''the need to increase pressure on extremist safe havens'' in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as efforts ''to support Afghan-led reintegration and reconciliation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the biggest focus of the meeting and there was not extensive discussion of the Afghan peace talks. Gen. David H. Petraeus provided an update on operations in Afghanistan, including in the Kandahar area where the Taliban historically has been strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama plans to leave for Asia after the midterm election on Nov. 2, visiting India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. By announcing a 2011 trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now, the White House hoped to douse the inevitable speculation about whether he would add an unannounced stop there while he was in the region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The powerful bombs concealed inside cargo packages and destined for the United States were expertly constructed and unusually sophisticated, American officials said Saturday, further evidence that Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen is steadily improving its abilities to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As investigators on three continents conducted forensic analyses of two bombs shipped from Yemen and intercepted Friday in Britain and Dubai, American officials said evidence was mounting that the top leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was behind the attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemeni officials on Saturday announced the arrest of a young woman and her mother in connection with the plot, which also may have involved two language schools in Yemen. The two women were not identified, but a defense lawyer who has been in contact with the family, Abdul Rahman Barham, said the daughter was a 22 year-old engineering student at Sana University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said Saturday night during a news conference that Yemeni security forces had identified her based on a tip from American officials, but he did not indicate her suspected role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators said that the bomb discovered at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates was concealed in a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer, with high explosives packed into a printer cartridge to avoid detection by scanners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals,'' said one official involved in the investigation, who like several officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. ''It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bomb discovered in Britain was also hidden in a printer cartridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terror plot broke publicly in dramatic fashion on Friday morning, when the two packages containing explosives and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centers in Chicago were found, setting off an international dragnet and fears about packages yet to be discovered. It also led to a tense scene in which American military jets escorted a plane to Kennedy International Airport amid concerns -- which turned out to be unfounded -- that there might be explosives on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, in news conferences in London and Yemen, and from interviews with investigators here and abroad, the contours of the investigation began to emerge, along with new details of the frantic hours leading to the discovery of the packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials said their operating assumption was that the two bombs were the work of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, Al Qaeda in Yemen's top bomb-maker, whose previous devices have been more rudimentary, and also unsuccessful. Mr. Asiri is believed to have built both the bomb sewn into the underwear of the young Nigerian who tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last Dec. 25, and the suicide bomb that nearly killed Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief, Mohammed bin Nayef, months earlier. (In the second episode, American officials say, Mr. Asiri hid the explosives in a body cavity of his brother, the suicide bomber.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in the two previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bomb discovered in Dubai contained the explosive PETN, according to the Dubai police and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security. This new plot, Ms. Napolitano said, had the ''hallmarks of Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The targets of the bombs remained in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said on Saturday that the parcel bomb intercepted in England was designed to explode while the plane was flying. The country's home secretary, Theresa May, said that British investigators had also concluded the device was ''viable and could have exploded.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The target may have been an aircraft, and had it detonated, the aircraft could have been brought down,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But earlier in the day, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House homeland security intelligence subcommittee, said that federal authorities indicated to him that the packages were probably intended to blow up the Jewish sites in Chicago rather than the cargo planes, since they do not carry passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on a conversation with Ms. Napolitano, he said that authorities were also leaving open the possibility that other packages with explosives had not yet been found. On Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department's chief spokesman, said that no specific threats had been made against synagogues or Jewish neighborhoods in the city, but that officers were watching them more closely as a precaution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a call from Mr. bin Nayef, the Saudi intelligence chief, on Thursday evening to John O. Brennan, the White House senior counterterrorism official and former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that set off the search, according to American officials. They said Mr. bin Nayef also notified C.I.A. officials in Riyadh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia has sometimes been a reluctant ally in America's global campaign against radical militants. But it sees Yemen, its impoverished next door neighbor, as a different matter. The Saudis consider the Qaeda branch in Yemen its biggest security threat and Saudi intelligence has set up both a web of electronic surveillance and spies to penetrate the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the evidence, American intelligence officials say they believe that the plot may have been blessed by the highest levels of Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, including Mr. Awlaki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We know that Awlaki has taken a very specific interest in plotting against the United States, and we've found that he's usually behind any attempted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American targets,'' said one official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still they cautioned that it was still early to draw any firm conclusions and they did not present proof of Mr. Awlaki's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the C.I.A. designated Mr. Awlaki -- an American citizen -- as a high priority for the agency's campaign of targeted killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one official involved in the investigation, the package that was discovered in Dubai had a woman's name and location in Sana on the return address. The package left Yemen on Thursday, the official said, where it was flown to Doha, Qatar, and on to Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security dispatched a cable warning that the bombs may have been associated with two schools in Yemen -- the Yemen American Institute for Languages-Computer Management, and the American Center for Training and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That connection would echo the attempted bombing last Dec. 25; the Nigerian who was implicated had studied at a different Sana language school before training with Al Qaeda. If language schools are again involved, it opens the possibility that a foreign student or students may have participated in the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security forces in Yemen were in a state of heightened alert on Saturday, as investigators questioned cargo employees and shut down the FedEx and U.P.S. offices in Sana, the Yemeni capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials said they were discussing a range of responses to the thwarted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The failed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Dec. 25 created an opportunity for the White House to press Yemen's government to take more aggressive action against Qaeda operatives there, and some American officials believe the conditions are similar now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A thinly veiled campaign of American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yemen this year has achieved mixed results. American officials said that several Qaeda operatives had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but there have also been major setbacks, including a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in May that accidentally killed a deputy governor in a remote province of Yemen. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> infuriated Yemen's president, Mr. Saleh, and forced a months-long halt in the American military campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, the Obama administration has been debating whether to escalate its secret offensive against the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The C.I.A. has a fraction of the staff in Yemen that it currently has in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the spy agency is running a covert war in the country's tribal areas, but over the course of the year the C.I.A. has sent more case officers and analysts to Sana as part of a task force with the military's Joint Special Operations Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials have been considering sending armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to Yemen to replicate the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, but such a move would almost certainly require the approval of the mercurial Mr. Saleh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemeni officials have declined to comment on details of the plot, saying only that they are investigating. But new checkpoints appeared in the capital on Saturday, with officers checking the identity cards of drivers and pedestrians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- For the United States, a recent tripling in the number of night raids by Special Operations forces to capture or kill Afghan insurgents has begun to put heavy pressure on the Taliban and change the momentum in the war in Afghanistan. For President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, the raids cause civilian casualties and are a rising political liability, so much so that he is now loudly insisting that the Americans stop the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference -- and a flare-up over the raids between Mr. Karzai and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Afghanistan -- is likely to be a central focus at a NATO summit this week in Lisbon, where the United States and NATO are to present a plan that seeks to end the combat mission in Afghanistan by 2014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, the Obama administration took a diplomatic tone so as not to further inflame the situation before the Lisbon meeting, which will include President Obama, other NATO leaders and Mr. Karzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''On President Karzai's concerns, we share these concerns,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters on Monday. ''We've discussed them on a number of occasions.'' But she stressed that ''these operations are conducted in full partnership with the government of Afghanistan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the center of the public debate -- the latest chapter in the tense relationship between the United States and Mr. Karzai -- is an American military tactic that, while used for years, has become a cornerstone of General Petraeus's strategy to reassert NATO and Afghan control over contested parts of Afghanistan since the American troop buildup reached its peak at the end of the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a dozen times each night, teams of American and allied Special Operations forces and Afghan troops surround houses or compounds across the country. In some cases helicopters hover overhead. Using bullhorns, the Afghans demand occupants come out or be met with violence. In the majority of cases -- about 80 percent, according to NATO statistics -- the occupants are captured rather than killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as early July, Special Operations forces were carrying out an average of five raids a night, mostly in southern Afghanistan. But in a 90-day period that ended Nov. 11, Special Operations forces were averaging 17 missions a night, conducting 1,572 operations over three months that resulted in 368 insurgent leaders killed or captured, and 968 lower-level insurgents killed and 2,477 captured, according to NATO statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Afghans see the raids as a flagrant, even humiliating symbol of American power, especially when women and children are rousted in the middle of the night. And protests have increased this year as the tempo has increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one high-profile encounter in February, 23 Afghan male civilians were killed and 12 Afghan women and children were wounded in a helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when Army Special Forces were operating in a village in Oruzgan Province. An Air Force investigation concluded that a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operator had dismissed two warnings about the presence of youths in the area before military commanders ordered the helicopter to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Karzai told The Washington Post on Sunday, in the interview that created the latest outbreak of controversy, that the raids were undermining support for the American-led war effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Afghan people don't like these raids. If there is any raid, it has to be done by the Afghan government, within the Afghan laws,'' he told The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Clinton and other American officials insist that Afghan troops have participated as full partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO officials in Kabul say that representatives from the Afghan ministries of defense and interior, and from Mr. Karzai's own national directorate of security, work inside the operations center and approve each mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say that new rules have significantly decreased the chances of civilian casualties, and are intended to make the American-led raids seem less like an affront to Afghan sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, Afghans are the first ones in to search any homes or compounds, and female Afghan police officers accompany the missions in case female detainees must be searched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They check the due-diligence box in very credible ways,'' said Bill Harris, a retired senior Foreign Service officer who recently wrapped up a yearlong tour leading the State Department's provincial reconstruction team in Kandahar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a major increase in surveillance planes, more cellphone monitoring and a rise in informers as local residents gain confidence in their security, the Americans say the compounds and the people in them are now more precisely pinpointed. They say the raids are focused on Taliban shadow governors, midlevel insurgent commanders and people who handle finances and logistics for the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in turn, puts pressure on senior Taliban leaders operating in the safe havens of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to a strategy outlined by General Petraeus, who hopes they may be forced to the bargaining table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials said they are hoping Mr. Karzai will temper his comments on the raids at the NATO summit in Lisbon, where the way ahead in Afghanistan is a main topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He wants to get to the point where the south and east of the country don't have dozens of raids every night,'' said an administration official involved in Afghan policy, acknowledging that the raids pose a political problem for the Afghan president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He wants to drive a return to normalcy. It's not normal to have night raids happening in your village. I just think when he does these things he speaks less precisely than we would like. If he had said the same thing in the context of transition and where he hopes and expects the international effort to go, it wouldn't have been a crisis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was baffled by Mr. Karzai's comments. He said the topic of the night raids never came up during a dinner he attended last week with Mr. Karzai and other senators in Kabul. The raids, he said, were crucial to the military strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you took the night raids off the table,'' Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday, ''it would be a disaster for the Petraeus strategy.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany dispatched heavily armed police officers and bomb-sniffing dogs to train stations, airports and key landmarks on Wednesday as a new picture emerged of the terrorist threat that had already raised security levels in Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a hastily called news conference in Berlin, the country's interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said the government had ''concrete indications of a series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned for the end of November,'' and German, Pakistani and American officials offered similar accounts of intelligence that pointed to imminent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by terrorists trained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said that American military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in those countries had killed some of the plotters and disrupted the plans, but that others were at large and might still </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, an American counterterrorism official detailed the intelligence behind a warning issued in October to Americans traveling in Europe. He said that about 25 fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda, organized into cells of three to five members, had been planning commando </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Britain, France and Germany. Since then, the official said, about 10 of the fighters have been killed or captured, most of them by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because his comments involved security matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani official, who also spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in September and October were believed to have killed European recruits directly involved in various plots, possibly including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Germany and Britain. But he said several such plotters were believed to be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France has been on high alert for several weeks, deploying nearly 5,000 extra members of the military and the police force to patrol sites deemed vulnerable. Five people were arrested in France on terrorism charges last week. Officials said one of them had spent time in Afghanistan and the others had planned to travel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The officials also said one of the suspects had been involved in an assassination plot against the leader of the Great Mosque of Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-ranking German intelligence official said reports had been streaming in for months that teams might be heading to Germany for a Mumbai-style </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or other terrorism </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The situation has developed over the past weeks and months,'' the official said, also speaking anonymously. ''There were new messages almost every day. The number of messages increased and concentrated on Germany.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, the warnings included none of the specifics of the Saudi tip that allowed the authorities in Britain and Dubai to intercept powerful bombs hidden in air cargo shipped from Yemen late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In essence, the messages are nonspecific, and the sources are difficult to reconstruct,'' the official said. ''It was a colorful variety of information, and because of this, the impression developed that something is about to happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one European intelligence official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, some attackers might be in place. That official said that ''within the last six weeks there had been some Germans arrested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' who said as much, though they did not know where or when a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Maiziere's declaration on Wednesday that ''the security situation in Germany has become more serious,'' and the decision to put on a show of force on the streets, represented a significant shift in strategy. Germany had largely restrained from issuing major warnings, saying that such alerts alarmed the public while doing little to protect it -- in itself a sort of victory for terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Maiziere did not specify the exact nature of the new information, saying only that it had emerged after the interception of the Yemen bombs, one of which had passed through a German airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German intelligence official said the shift was not so much a result of a single tip than of the buildup of reports that indicated German targets were at risk and of increased concerns about cargo security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those concerns -- underscored in Germany by the discovery of a package bomb from Greece that was found in Chancellor Angela Merkel's mail -- are particularly troubling at a time of year when holiday purchases and gifts are flooding shipping agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Mr. de Maiziere insisted that while there was cause for concern there was ''no reason to panic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We won't be intimidated by international terror,'' he said, ''neither in our way of life, nor our culture or freedom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the busy Friedrichstrasse station in Berlin, where national, regional and commuter train lines intersect, heavily armed officers in dark uniforms patrolled the platforms and entry and exit points during the afternoon rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security staff of Deutsche Bahn, the German federal railways, seemed relaxed about Mr. de Maiziere's new alert, with officers smoking and chatting outside the station, but there was an increased police presence in the streets near Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I worry about these terror alerts,'' said Sabine Krohl, a sales assistant. ''It's all very well shrugging them off by saying it will never happen here in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But you just never know,'' she added, rushing to catch her commuter train.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Less than a month after President Obama testily assured reporters in 2009 that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear materials ''will remain out of militant hands,'' his ambassador here sent a secret message to Washington suggesting that she remained deeply worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador's concern was a stockpile of highly enriched uranium, sitting for years near an aging research nuclear reactor in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There was enough to build several ''dirty bombs'' or, in skilled hands, possibly enough for an actual nuclear bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the cable, dated May 27, 2009, the ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, reported that the Pakistani government was yet again dragging its feet on an agreement reached two years earlier to have the United States remove the material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote to senior American officials that the Pakistani government had concluded that ''the 'sensational' international and local media coverage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time.'' A senior Pakistani official, she said, warned that if word leaked out that Americans were helping remove the fuel, the local press would certainly ''portray it as the United States taking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fuel is still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be the most unnerving evidence of the complex relationship -- sometimes cooperative, often confrontational, always wary -- between America and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nearly 10 years into the American-led war in Afghanistan. The cables, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to a number of news organizations, make it clear that underneath public reassurances lie deep clashes over strategic goals on issues like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support for the Afghan Taliban and tolerance of Al Qaeda, and Washington's warmer relations with India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archenemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Written from the American Embassy in Islamabad, the cables reveal American maneuvering as diplomats try to support an unpopular elected government that is more sympathetic to American aims than is the real power in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the army and intelligence agency so crucial to the fight against militants. The cables show just how weak the civilian government is: President Asif Ali Zardari told Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that he worried that the military might ''take me out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustration at American inability to persuade the Pakistani Army and intelligence agency to stop supporting the Afghan Taliban and other militants runs through the reports of meetings between American and Pakistani officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That frustration preoccupied the Bush administration and became an issue for the incoming Obama administration, the cables document, during a trip in January 2009 that Mr. Biden made to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11 days before he was sworn in. In a meeting with Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief of staff, Mr. Biden asked several times whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States ''had the same enemy as we move forward.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The United States needs to be able to make an objective assessment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> part of the bargain,'' Mr. Biden said, according to a Feb. 6, 2009, cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Kayani tried to reassure him, saying, ''We are on the same page in Afghanistan, but there might be different tactics.'' Mr. Biden replied that ''results'' would test that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cables reveal at least one example of increased cooperation, previously undisclosed, under the Obama administration. Last fall, the Pakistani Army secretly allowed 12 American Special Operations soldiers to deploy with Pakistani troops in the violent tribal areas near the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans were forbidden to conduct combat missions. Even though their numbers were small, their presence at army headquarters in Bajaur, South Waziristan and North Waziristan was a ''sea change in thinking,'' the embassy reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embassy added its usual caution: The deployments must be kept secret or the ''Pakistani military will likely stop making requests for such assistance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the past year, however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States have gingerly started to publicly acknowledge the role of American field advisers. Lt. Col. Michael Shavers, an American military spokesman in Islamabad, said in a statement that ''at the request of the Pakistanis,'' small teams of Special Operations forces ''move to various locations with their Pakistani military counterparts throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, last week in a report to Congress on operations in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said that the Pakistani Army had also accepted American and coalition advisers in Quetta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cables do not deal with the sharp increase under Mr. Obama in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the tribal areas with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tacit approval. That is because the cables are not classified at the highest levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Deep Skepticism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, though, the cables portray deep skepticism that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will ever cooperate fully in fighting the full panoply of extremist groups. This is partly because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees some of the strongest militant groups as insurance for the inevitable day that the United States military withdraws from Afghanistan -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to exert maximum influence inside Afghanistan and against Indian intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the consul general in Peshawar wrote in 2008 that she believed that some members of the Haqqani network -- one of the most lethal groups attacking American and Afghan soldiers -- had left North Waziristan to escape </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some family members, she wrote, relocated south of Peshawar; others lived in Rawalpindi, where senior Pakistani military officials also live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one cable, Ms. Patterson, a veteran diplomat who left Islamabad in October after a three-year stint as ambassador, said more money and military assistance would not be persuasive. ''There is no chance that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will view enhanced assistance levels in any field as sufficient compensation for abandoning support for these groups, which it sees as an important part of its national security apparatus against India.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rare tone of dissent with Washington, she said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would only dig in deeper if America continued to improve ties with India, which she said ''feeds Pakistani establishment paranoia and pushes them closer to both Afghan and Kashmir focused terrorist groups.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups Ms. Patterson referred to were almost certainly the Haqqani network of the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, a group financed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the 1990s to fight India in Kashmir that is accused of the 2008 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly enriched uranium that Ms. Patterson wanted removed from the research reactor came from the United States in the mid-1960s. In those days, under the Atoms for Peace program, little thought was given to proliferation, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed too poor and backward to join the nuclear race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by May 2009, all that had changed, and her terse cable to the State and Defense Departments, among others, touched every nerve in the fraught relationship: mutual mistrust, the safety of the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, broken promises and a pervasive fear that any talk about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vulnerability would end whatever cooperation existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reactor had been converted to use low-enriched uranium, well below bomb grade, in 1990, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, or I.A.E.A. But the bomb-grade uranium had never been returned to the United States and remains in storage nearby. Ms. Patterson's cable noted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''agreed in principle to the fuel removal in 2007.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But time and again the Pakistanis balked, and she reported that an interagency group within the Pakistani government had decided to cancel a visit by American technical experts to get the fuel out of the country. She concluded that ''it is clear that the negative media attention has begun to hamper U.S. efforts to improve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear security and nonproliferation practices.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any progress, she suggested, would have to await a ''more conducive'' political climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement confirming that ''the US suggestion to have the fuel transferred was plainly refused by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' It said that the United States had provided the fuel but did not mention that, under the terms of such transfers, the United States retained the right to have the spent fuel returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador's comments help explain why Mr. Obama and his aides have expressed confidence in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear security when asked in public. But at the beginning of the administration's review of its Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy, a highly classified intelligence report delivered to Mr. Obama said that while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weapons were well secured, there was deep, continuing concern about ''insider access,'' meaning elements in the military or intelligence services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Ms. Patterson, in a Feb. 4, 2009, cable, wrote that ''our major concern is not having an Islamic militant steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in GOP [government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's review concluded by determining that there were two ''vital'' American interests in the region. One was defeating Al Qaeda. The second, not previously reported, was making sure terrorists could never gain access to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear program. That goal was classified, to keep from angering Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the status of the fuel at the research reactor, Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Energy Department, said, ''The United States supplied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with fuel for a research reactor decades ago for the purpose of producing medical isotopes and scientific research.'' Implicitly acknowledging that the material remains there, Mr. LaVera said ''the fuel is under I.A.E.A. safeguards and has not been part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons program.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One secret cable offers another glimpse into another element of the nuclear gamesmanship between the United States and its Pakistani allies: Even while American officials were trying to persuade Pakistani officials to give up nuclear material, they were quietly seeking to block </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from trying to buy material that would help it produce tritium, the crucial ingredient needed to increase the power of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After providing specific details of the proposed sale, a Dec. 12, 2008, secret cable to the American Embassy in Singapore, seeking help to stop a transaction that was about to take place, concluded, ''We would have great concern over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> potential use of tritium to advance its nuclear weapons program.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of Army Abuses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cables also reveal that the American Embassy had received credible reports of extrajudicial killings of prisoners by the Pakistani Army more than a year before the Obama administration publicly acknowledged the problem and before a video that is said to show such killings surfaced on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings are another source of tension, complicated by American pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be more aggressive in confronting militants on its own soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Sept. 10, 2009, cable labeled ''secret/noforn,'' meaning that it was too delicate to be shared with foreign governments, the embassy confronted allegations of human rights abuses in the Swat Valley and the tribal areas since the Pakistani Army had begun fighting the Taliban a few months earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While carefully worded, the cable left little doubt about what was going on. It spoke of a ''growing body of evidence'' that gave credence to the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The crux of the problem appears to center on the treatment of terrorists detained in battlefield operations and have focused on the extrajudicial killing of some detainees,'' the cable said. ''The detainees involved were in the custody of Frontier Corps or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army units.'' The Frontier Corps is a paramilitary force partly financed by the United States to fight the insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Army was holding as many as 5,000 ''terrorist detainees,'' the cable said, about twice as many as the army had acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned that the United States should not offend the Pakistani Army, the cable stressed that any talk of the killings must be kept out of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Post advises that we avoid comment on these incidents to the extent possible and that efforts remain focused on dialogue and the assistance strategy,'' the ambassador wrote. This September, however, the issue exploded into public view when a video emerged showing Pakistani soldiers executing six unarmed young men in civilian clothes. In October, the Obama administration suspended financing to half a dozen Pakistani Army units believed to have killed civilians or unarmed prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cables verge on gossipy, as diplomats strained to understand the personalities behind the fractious Pakistani government, and particularly two men: General Kayani and President Zardari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, the United States finds that Mr. Zardari, the accidental leader after the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, is sympathetic to American goals -- stiff sanctions on terrorist financing, the closing down of terrorist training camps -- but lacks the power to fulfill his promises against resistance from the military and intelligence agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari's chief antagonist, General Kayani, emerges as a stubborn guarantor of what he sees as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national interest, an army chief who meddles in civilian politics but stops short of overturning the elected order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the Obama administration, General Kayani made clear a condition for improved relations. As the director general of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, from 2004 to 2007, he did not want a ''reckoning with the past,'' said a cable in 2009 introducing him to the new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kayani will want to hear that the United States has turned the page on past ISI operations,'' it said. General Kayani was probably referring to the peace accords with the Taliban from 2004 to 2007 that resulted in the strengthening of the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the general seems confidently in charge, the cables portray Mr. Zardari as a man not fully aware of his weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point he said he would not object if Abdul Qadeer Khan, revered in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the father of its nuclear weapons program, were interviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency but tacitly acknowledged that he was powerless to make that happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari, who spent 11 years in prison on ultimately unproved corruption charges, feared for his position and possibly -- the wording is ambiguous -- his life: the cables reveal that Vice President Biden told Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain in March 2009 that Mr. Zardari had told him that the ''ISI director and Kayani will take me out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His suspicions were not groundless. In March 2009, a period of political turmoil, General Kayani told the ambassador that he ''might, however reluctantly,'' pressure Mr. Zardari to resign and, the cable added, presumably leave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He mentioned the leader of a third political party, Asfandyar Wali Khan, as a possible replacement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kayani made it clear regardless how much he disliked Zardari he distrusted Nawaz even more,'' the ambassador wrote, a reference to Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2010, after many sessions with Mr. Zardari, Ms. Patterson had revised the guarded optimism that characterized her early cables about Mr. Zardari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government remains weak, ineffectual and corrupt,'' she wrote on Feb. 22, 2010, the eve of a visit by the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III. ''Domestic politics is dominated by uncertainty about the fate of President Zardari.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That assessment holds more than eight months later, even as Mr. Obama in October extended an invitation to the Mr. Zardari leader to visit the White House next year, as the leader of a nation that holds a key to peace in Afghanistan but appears too divided and mistrustful to turn it for the Americans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As President Obama prepares to release a review of American strategy in Afghanistan that will claim progress in the nine-year-old war there, two new classified intelligence reports offer a more negative assessment and say there is a limited chance of success unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hunts down insurgents operating from havens on its Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports, one on Afghanistan and one on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, say that although there have been gains for the United States and NATO in the war, the unwillingness of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to shut down militant sanctuaries in its lawless tribal region remains a serious obstacle. American military commanders say insurgents freely cross from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan to plant bombs and fight American troops and then return to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for rest and resupply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings in the reports, called National Intelligence Estimates, represent the consensus view of the United States' 16 intelligence agencies, as opposed to the military, and were provided last week to some members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. The findings were described by a number of American officials who read the reports' executive summaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American military commanders and senior Pentagon officials have already criticized the reports as out of date and say that the cut-off date for the Afghanistan report, Oct. 1, does not allow it to take into account what the military cites as tactical gains in Kandahar and Helmand Provinces in the south in the six weeks since. Pentagon and military officials also say the reports were written by desk-bound Washington analysts who have spent limited time, if any, in Afghanistan and have no feel for the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are not on the ground living it day in and day out like our forces are, so they don't have the proximity and perspective,'' said a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified while criticizing the intelligence agencies. The official said that the 30,000 additional troops that Mr. Obama ordered to Afghanistan in December 2009 did not all arrive until September, meaning that the intelligence agencies had little time to judge the effects of the escalation. There are now about 100,000 American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute between the military and intelligence agencies reflects how much the debate in Washington over the war is now centered on whether the United States can succeed in Afghanistan without the cooperation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which despite years of American pressure has resisted routing militants on its border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute also reflects the longstanding cultural differences between intelligence analysts, whose job is to warn of potential bad news, and military commanders, who are trained to promote ''can do'' optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Afghanistan, the intelligence agencies play a strong role, with the largest Central Intelligence Agency station since the Vietnam War located in Kabul. C.I.A. operatives also command an Afghan paramilitary force in the thousands. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the C.I.A. is running a covert war using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have found some areas of agreement in the period leading up to Mr. Obama's review, which will be made public on Thursday. The intelligence reports, which rely heavily on assessments from the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, conclude that C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on leaders of Al Qaeda in the tribal regions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have had an impact and that security has improved in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar Provinces in southern Afghanistan where the United States has built up its troop presence. For their part, American commanders and Pentagon officials say they do not yet know if the war can be won without more cooperation from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But after years and billions spent trying to win the support of the Pakistanis, they are now proceeding on the assumption that there will be limited help from them. The American commanders and officials readily describe the havens for insurgents in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a major impediment to military operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not going to make any bones about it, they've got sanctuaries and they go back and forth across the border,'' Maj. Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan, told reporters last week in the remote Kunar Province of Afghanistan. ''They're financed better, they're better trained, they're the ones who bring in the higher-end I.E.D.'s.'' General Campbell was referring to improvised explosive devices, the military's name for the insurgent-made bombs, the leading cause of American military deaths in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American commanders say their plan in the next few years is to kill large numbers of insurgents in the border region -- the military refers to it as ''degrading the Taliban'' -- and at the same time build up the Afghan National Army to the point that the Afghans can at least contain an insurgency still supported by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (American officials say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supports the insurgents as a proxy force in Afghanistan, preparing for the day the Americans leave.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That is not the optimal solution, obviously,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. official and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who led a White House review of Afghan strategy last year that resulted in Mr. Obama sending the additional forces. ''But we have to deal with the world we have, not the world we'd like. We can't make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stop being naughty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, American officials and military commanders continue to praise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, if only for acknowledging the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''General Kayani and others have been clear in recognizing that they need to do more for their security and indeed to carry out operations against those who threaten other countries' security,'' Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Afghanistan, said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Afghan officials say that the United States, which sends </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about $2 billion in military and civilian aid each year, is coddling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for no end. ''They are capitalizing on your immediate security needs, and they are stuck in this thinking that bad behavior brings cash,'' said Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief, in an interview on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence report also reaffirms past American concerns about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear stockpile, particularly the risk that enriched uranium or plutonium could be smuggled out of a laboratory or storage site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House review comes as some members of Mr. Obama's party are losing patience with the war. ''You're not going to get to the point where the Taliban are gone and the border is perfectly controlled,'' said Representative Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in an interview on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Smith said there would be increasing pressure from the political left on Mr. Obama to end the war, and he predicted that Democrats in Congress would resist continuing to spend $100 billion annually on Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're not going to be hanging out over there fighting these guys like we're fighting them now for 20 years,'' Mr. Smith said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No American has worked harder to build better relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army than Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as he completed his 21st meeting with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top general, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in Islamabad on Wednesday, he was no closer to securing General Kayani's commitment to go after the Taliban groups that are launching murderous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks from Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border region into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Admiral Mullen's trip this week, which includes a member of our editorial board, he has been talking about the need for ''strategic patience.'' But until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army moves against the Afghan Taliban -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence service cuts all ties with the extremists -- the prospects for President Obama's war strategy are, frankly, dim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Mr. Obama plans to issue his promised review of the war. It must provide clarity about the way forward in both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is expected to argue that, with about 140,000 American and NATO troops now on the ground, there has been progress in Afghanistan, most notably pushing back Taliban forces from around Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual base and the country's second-largest city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the list of things still going wrong is depressingly long, starting with the incompetence and corruption of the government of President Hamid Karzai. And as The Times reported on Wednesday, two new classified intelligence reports are particularly downbeat about the ease with which Pakistani-based militants cross into Afghanistan, as well as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refusal to shut down the sanctuaries used by the militants for rest and resupply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some American military commanders disputed the reports' overall pessimism, there have been disturbing signs on our visit this week that the Pentagon is increasingly resigned to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defense official argued that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army is so overstretched -- from flood relief and 19 months of sustained combat that has caused thousands of Pakistani casualties -- that it cannot possibly undertake any more operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be true, but it would not take a major offensive for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to weaken the insurgents. The country's intelligence service, the ISI, could start by withdrawing all support and protection from the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army vows to take on militants spreading chaos and mayhem inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the intelligence service still sees the Afghan Taliban as a way to ensure influence on the other side of the border and keep India's influence at bay. It is a dangerous game, based on a flawed premise. American officials say the Taliban, Al Qaeda and other groups increasingly act like a syndicate, sharing know-how and colluding when needed. General Kayani, whose previous job was heading the ISI, should certainly know that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has said and done many of the right things to build a long-term relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including cultivating top military leaders and providing long-term development aid. And not all of the news is grim. Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and American forces jointly launched a successful cross-border operation. The number of American cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks into Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have also increased significantly, while Islamabad's protests have been comparatively muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a relationship this complicated, strategic patience may well be necessary. The problem is that the Taliban pose a threat, right now, to the survival of both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Obama and his advisers -- military and civilian -- clearly have to do more to change the thinking in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Americans, anxious about the war in Afghanistan, there is not a lot of comfort or clarity to be found in President Obama's long-promised strategy review.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, American officials have been talking about fragile progress, a small drawdown of troops starting next summer, and 2014 as the date when Afghans will take ''the lead'' for their own security. The unclassified version of the report released Thursday did not go any further, nor did President Obama in his remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the murkiness may be unavoidable. It has been a year since the president announced he was sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, but the last arrived only last summer. It may be too early to know if the military gains claimed by the Pentagon since then are temporary or have a real chance of breaking the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting in The Times shows a very mixed picture. Carlotta Gall and Ruhullah Khapalwak reported on Thursday that the American offensive in Kandahar Province was turning local residents against the insurgents -- at least for now -- and undermining the Taliban's morale and its ability to recruit fighters. The same day, Alissa Rubin reported that insecurity is rising in the north, where the Taliban are expanding their reach and local armed groups are terrorizing residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is even harder to judge the administration's claims about ''disrupting and dismantling'' Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These things may be difficult to measure, but there is no excuse for the review's failure to explain how the administration plans to deal with two of its biggest problems: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued refusal to go after Taliban and Al Qaeda sanctuaries, and the corruption and incompetence of the Afghan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand the deep anti-American sentiments in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the high strategic stakes. But we worry that the Pentagon is increasingly resigned to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inaction. American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be inflicting real pain on Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, but likely not enough. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army needs to do more to stop insurgents from crossing into Afghanistan, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence service must end its support and protection for the extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has to signal more clearly -- to the Pakistanis and his own team -- that American patience has limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, at least the public version, is even less frank about the myriad failings of the Afghan government and its erratic leader, President Hamid Karzai. Unlike Mr. Obama's speech last December -- when he said ''the days of providing a blank check are over'' -- there wasn't even an implicit warning to Mr. Karzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the administration got nowhere trying to bully Mr. Karzai. But private cajoling doesn't appear to be any better. What is President Obama's strategy for handling the Afghan president, or for empowering other more credible regional and local leaders? The report is silent on that, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama promised this review last December, he also vowed that America's commitment in Afghanistan would not be open-ended. It may be too early to judge whether the strategy is working. But Americans will need a full accounting soon. Right now, they need a lot franker talk from Mr. Obama about what is really happening on the ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration plans to further step up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to address one of the fundamental weaknesses uncovered in its year-end review of its Afghanistan war strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials said the increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the Afghan border would help offset the Pakistani government's continued refusal to move against the Qaeda leadership and their extremist allies, especially the Haqqani network. From havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Waziristan region, those groups have carried out deadly assaults against American troops and have plotted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing on Thursday that the 97,000 American troops now in Afghanistan have made some fragile gains in the past year, President Obama said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was ''increasingly coming to realize that the Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders who have been given safe havens pose a threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Nevertheless,'' Mr. Obama added, ''progress has not come fast enough.'' The United States, he said, ''will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials said they expected the Pakistani military to finally enter North Waziristan in 2011, based on private assurances from the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real strategy appears to be for the United States to do most of the work itself -- at least until the Pakistanis step up. That means even more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, and possibly carrying out Special Forces operations along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are a lot of, as we say in our building, kinetic actions taking place along that border,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said during a news conference at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gates went to some lengths to praise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying that along parts of the border he was happy to see ''the Pakistanis come in behind the insurgents from the Pakistani side and, coordinating with us and the Afghans, we're on the other side.'' He described the insurgents caught in between as ''the meat in the sandwich.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review was carefully worded and pulled its punches in describing the differences between Washington and its Pakistani and Afghan government allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announced in a series of briefings by the president and his top foreign policy aides, the report is the first full-scale review of the administration's strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summary said the United States continued to kill leaders of Al Qaeda and diminish its capacity to carry out terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the region. It cited some signs that the United States and its allies had halted or reversed inroads by the Taliban in Afghanistan and strengthened the ability of Afghan forces to secure their country. But it acknowledged that the gains were fragile and could be easily undone unless more progress was made in hunting down insurgents operating from havens in neighboring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summary points to a handful of areas where the influx of American troops has had an impact. For instance, night raids by Special Forces operatives and increased security measures in villages, the report said, have reduced overall Taliban influences in the movement's heartland of Kandahar and Helmand Provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Afghan Army has exceeded growth targets set by NATO and American military officials, and the training of the Afghan forces who will be expected to take over the lead from American and NATO troops has improved, the summary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the report was portrayed as critical to decisions about the course of the conflict and the pace of withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent weeks the White House has been playing down the importance of the report, as it has balanced pressure from the military for time to allow the troop buildup to work, and from Democrats who want to wind down the nine-year conflict. Some of those debates have taken place inside the administration itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those internal arguments may flare again next summer, when the White House has to decide precisely how many troops to pull out. Already some crucial players from the earlier debate are no longer on the scene: Rahm Emanuel, who was the White House chief of staff, and Gen. James L. Jones, Mr. Obama's first national security adviser, have resigned, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, died suddenly this week. Of the three, Mr. Emanuel was the most forceful advocate for deploying the fewest number of troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will largely involve increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military has also embedded small numbers of Special Operations troops with Pakistani military units carrying out operations in the tribal areas. The Pentagon has rarely blessed cross- border raids from Afghanistan, fearing a sharp backlash for American troops if villagers were killed on Pakistani soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time the United States tried a cross-border operation -- in September -- a furious Pakistani government responded by shutting down a critical supply route into Afghanistan, leaving the road open, literally, for insurgents to blow up dozens of trucks, lined up like sitting ducks, which were meant to provide supplies to American and NATO troops in Afghanistan. The United States apologized for the helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed three Pakistani border soldiers and ignited the episode, and eventually </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reopened the border crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have already risen significantly over the past year. The Central Intelligence Agency carried out roughly 53 Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2009, which was more than President George W. Bush authorized during his entire presidency. The figure has more than doubled this year, though presidential aides will not publicly discuss the program because it is technically secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Pentagon, Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the United States would send conventional ground troops into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on their own only as a last resort. ''The question of going further to unilateral action, that would be an absolute last measure,'' he told reporters on Thursday. ''Because it has so many other impacts on the relationship that you'd really hate to end up in that position.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 2011 date to begin withdrawing troops is at the heart of the political quandary Mr. Obama faces. In announcing his troop increase for Afghanistan a year ago, he insisted that the buildup would be limited to 18 months, and then withdrawals would begin -- an effort to quiet his restive base of supporters and put pressure on Afghanistan to speed the training of its own troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that training is time-consuming, and while Congressional Republicans have backed Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy so far, he is facing opposition from members of his own party, who will undoubtedly increase the pressure on him next year to withdraw troops quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's new strategy review ''seems as finely parsed as last year's effort,'' said Representative Jane Harmon, a California Democrat. ''But this time, our ground game is a lot less convincing.'' She added that ''we need a clear public timetable to end our military mission in Afghanistan responsibly, and soon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, just finished a two-day visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where he met with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The review rightfully focused on the criticality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in terms of overall success,'' Admiral Mullen said. He said that it was crucial for the administration to maintain a ''long-term commitment'' to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which other administration officials said they hoped would help the Pakistani government to begin to view American interests as in alignment with their own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARACHI, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In this chaotic city of 18 million people, an exhibition of works by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most significant contemporary artists shows just how imbued with violence daily life here is: on the street, in the air and in the debate about the future course of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Installed in the elegant rooms of the Mohatta Palace Museum, a confection of Mughal architecture in pink stone, the exhibition, ''The Rising Tide: New Direction in Art From </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' includes more than 40 canvases, videos, installations, mobiles and sculptures made in the past 20 years. Its curator, the feminist sculptor and painter Naiza Khan, said her aim was to show the coming of age of Pakistani art, which blossomed when censorship was lifted after the death of the American-backed Islamic dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence was not an intended theme. ''I wanted the works to reflect the many strands of the urban condition,'' Ms. Khan said in her light-filled studio in an upscale neighborhood here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the corrosive impact of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struggle with Islamic militants, its tortured relationship with the United States and the effects of an all-powerful military pervade the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The artist Abdullah Syed, for example, assembled a fleet of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the pilotless American aircraft that fire missiles at militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas -- constructed from the blades of box cutters, the very instruments used by some of the 9/11 attackers. They float on wires just above the viewer's head, the silvery blades shimmering menacingly in bright light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second fleet of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is constructed from dollar bills folded into the shape of the planes and stapled together in circular patterns that resemble those of an oriental carpet. Called the ''Flying Rug,'' the paper fleet casts an ominous shadow on a nearby wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Syed, one of several artists in the show pursuing a career abroad, teaches at the University of New South Wales in Australia. ''I'm always navigating ideas between the West and here,'' he said, perched on a ladder as he hung his killer fleets. The ''Flying Rug'' takes sides: ''I'm saying, 'To hell with Uncle Sam.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though in the West the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are often seen as an essential element in the fight against terrorism, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they are considered imperial interference by the United States, he said. In the show's catalog Mr. Syed notes that according to one estimate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed more than 1,000 Pakistani civilians since 2004. Many more civilians have fled the tribal areas and settled in Karachi to escape the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an influx that has sharpened the city's political tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years work by Pakistani artists has begun appearing in museum shows outside the country -- in Paris, London and Dubai. Ms. Khan wanted to bring them home, to show the strength and variety of their projects. Among her choices are Rashid Rana, whose ''Desperately Seeking Paradise,'' a huge metal cube covered in photographs of the dilapidated residential buildings of Lahore, appeared at the Musee Guimet in Paris recently; and Imran Qureshi and Anwar Saeed, whose works appeared in ''Hanging Fire,'' a survey of Pakistani art at Asia Society in Manhattan last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Qureshi is a leader in the modern school of Pakistani miniature painting derived from the court painters of the Mughal era. But rather than paint delicate images of princes and princesses, modern miniaturists have expanded their vocabulary. Ms. Khan chose a Qureshi miniature of a missile, painted after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conducted nuclear tests in 1998. Also on display is a large-scale triptych panel by Mr. Qureshi of drips and splotches executed in a lush pomegranate hue. Or is that the color of blood?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of what differentiates this exhibition from the recent shows of Pakistani art in New York and Dubai is the inclusion of young people fresh out of the country's growing number of art schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Khan, 24, a recent graduate from the art department at Karachi University, is from the Pashtun ethnic group, whose traditional homeland is in the turbulent tribal areas in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the army is embroiled in fighting militants. To escape the lack of development in the region, many Pashtuns have moved to Karachi in the past 30 years, among them Ms. Khan's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Khan, who was born here and has never been to the tribal areas, doesn't even speak Pashto. ''They call me a fake Pashtun,'' she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her work Ms. Khan uses emblems of Pashtun culture painted in the style of a children's primer on pages sized to resemble a school exercise book. Among the images: an AK-47 rifle -- the standard-issue weapon of the tribal zone -- a bullet and a series of domestic items, including bread, milk and eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Pashtuns are very strong, but I am showing emblems in a soft way,'' she said. ''I am saying, 'We are not exactly what you think we are.' '' A simple two-part work by Risham Syed reflects the violence that many urban, middle-class Pakistanis feel. A red wall lamp similar to those that hang in the homes of the well-to-do in Lahore, in northeastern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is juxtaposed with a tiny 4-by-6-inch canvas, painted in a brutally realistic style. It shows a lone man in Islamic religious garb futilely trying to damp down a wall of flames that engulf a building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Syed, who teaches art at Beaconhouse National University in Lahore, seems to be edging close to the question some Pakistanis are raising gingerly about the responsibility of extremist clergy for the wave of suicide bombings in the nation's cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Khan, the curator, took a year away from her studio in Karachi to put the show together. She felt strongly, she said, that even though fear and violence emerged as central themes in the art, Karachi should be seen as more than just a city of gangland killings and ethnically directed shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It means a lot to me to bring art center stage at a time when so much is denied in the country,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Central Intelligence Agency's top clandestine officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capital, Islamabad, was removed from the country on Thursday amid an escalating war of recriminations between American and Pakistani spies, with some American officials convinced that the officer's cover was deliberately blown by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military intelligence agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American spy's hurried departure is the latest evidence of mounting tensions between two uneasy allies, with the Obama administration's strategy for ending the war in Afghanistan hinging on the cooperation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the hunt for militants in the mountains that border those two countries. The tensions could intensify in the coming months with the prospect of more American pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the cloak-and-dagger drama was playing out in Islamabad, 100 miles to the west the C.I.A. was expanding its covert war using armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants. Since Thursday, C.I.A. missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed dozens of suspects in Khyber Agency, a part of the tribal areas in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the spy agency had largely spared until now because of its proximity to the sprawling market city of Peshawar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials said the C.I.A. station chief had received a number of death threats since being publicly identified in a legal complaint sent to the Pakistani police this week by the family of victims of earlier </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American officials said they strongly suspected that operatives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful spy service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, had a hand in revealing the C.I.A. officer's identity -- possibly in retaliation for a civil lawsuit filed in Brooklyn last month implicating the ISI chief in the Mumbai terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of November 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not immediately provide details to support their suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistrust between the C.I.A. and ISI, two uneasy but co-dependent allies, could hardly come at a worse time. The Obama administration's Afghan war strategy depends on greater cooperation from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hunt militants in the country's western mountains, and yet if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers Washington's demands excessive, it could order an end to the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We will continue to help strengthen Pakistani capacity to root out terrorists,'' President Obama said Thursday in a briefing on the war strategy. ''Nevertheless, progress has not come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job of the C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad is perhaps the spy agency's most important overseas post, one that requires helping oversee the agency's covert war and massaging its often testy relationship with the ISI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That relationship has often frayed in recent years. American officials believe that ISI officers helped plan the deadly July 2008 bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well as provided support to Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who carried out the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael J. Morell, the C.I.A.'s deputy director, met Thursday with Pakistani officials in Islamabad, but American officials said his visit was not the result of the station chief's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit filed in Brooklyn last month, brought by families of American victims of the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> names the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, as being complicit in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suit asserts that General Pasha and other ISI officers were ''purposefully engaged in the direct provision of material support or resources'' to the planners of the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the Pakistani government ''believes that the suit in New York does not have a sound legal basis, and is based on conjecture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We did not need to retaliate,'' he said. ''As far as the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the ISI are concerned, we look forward to working with the Americans in securing the world from transnational threats, especially the shared threat of terrorism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal complaint in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that identified the station chief was filed Monday over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed at least four Pakistanis. The complaint sought police help in keeping the station chief in the country until a lawsuit could be filed. The C.I.A.'s decision to remove the station chief from Islamabad was first reported Friday morning by The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. officer's name was revealed last month in a news conference by Mirza Shahzad Akbar, the lawyer who filed the complaint this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon afterward, the name began appearing on a number of Pakistani Web sites generally believed to have a close association with the ISI. One Web site mentioned the C.I.A. officer on Dec. 14 and asked readers to track down pictures of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times generally does not identify American intelligence operatives working undercover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Akbar, the lawyer who brought the case against the C.I.A., said it would continue despite the station chief's absence. He is representing Kareem Khan, a resident of North Waziristan who said that his son and brother were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vast majority of C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas have occurred in North Waziristan. Mr. Khan is seeking $500 million in compensation, and accusing the C.I.A. officer of running a clandestine spying operation out of the United States Embassy in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My brother and son were innocent,'' Mr. Khan said in a recent interview. ''There were no Taliban hiding in my house.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western and Pakistani intelligence officials said, however, that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also killed Haji Omer, a senior commander allied with the Haqqani militant network and Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Akbar said that he did not believe that the station chief had been removed from Islamabad for his security. ''Obviously, his name had come out in the open, and maybe he feared police action or an action by the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Akbar said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials disagreed. The threats to the station chief ''were of such a serious nature that it would be imprudent not to act,'' according to a United States intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, would not confirm that the station chief had to leave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but did say that ''station chiefs routinely encounter major risk as they work to keep America safe,'' and that ''their security is obviously a top priority for the C.I.A., especially when there's an imminent threat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the C.I.A. has continued to pummel parts of the tribal areas with missiles. On Thursday, a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Tirah Valley of the Khyber Agency, where Pakistani militants are believed to have fled to escape military operations in other parts of the tribal belt. Three more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed on Friday, a Pakistani government official said, killing dozens of militant suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Khyber are uncommon. Pakistani officials have tried to dissuade the Americans from attacking Khyber and Mohmand Agency, fearing that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in those areas could fuel violence in Peshawar. The Khyber Agency is home to Lashkar-e-Islami, a militant organization sometimes allied with the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing the conclusions of the latest review of the Afghan war strategy, Obama administration officials said this week that the United States would be more aggressive in going after militants in the tribal areas -- with or without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online Correction: December 17, 2010, Friday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the actions of a lawyer representing a Pakistani man over deaths allegedly connected with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyer filed a complaint with police in Islamabad on Monday and had threatened to file a lawsuit last month; he has not yet filed the suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- An official of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top spy organization, angrily denied Saturday that it was responsible for revealing the name of the Central Intelligence Agency's top clandestine officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We absolutely deny this accusation, which is totally unsubstantiated and based on nothing but conjecture,'' a senior ISI official said in a background briefing at the headquarters of the spy organization in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top C.I.A. officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hastily left the country on Thursday after receiving death threats since being publicly identified in a legal complaint, American officials said. The complaint was filed by the family of victims of the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas; overseeing the program would fall to the station chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some American officials had said they strongly suspected that operatives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy service had a hand in revealing the C.I.A. officer's identity before the legal complaint was filed, possibly in retaliation for a civil lawsuit filed in Brooklyn last month implicating the ISI chief in the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India, in 2008. The American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not provide details to support their suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing those suspicions, published Saturday in The New York Times, the ISI official said: ''This organization has immense tolerance. We have cooperated to the hilt despite constant allegations leveled against us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that the article seemed ''intended to create rifts between the ISI and C.I.A.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the briefing Saturday, Pakistani officials said that the ISI had an excellent working relationship with the C.I.A. ''It has never communicated to us that they have doubts on our sincerity and credibility,'' one official said. ''Such accusations and insinuations only appear in media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies' relationship has often been troubled in recent years. American officials believe that ISI officers helped plan the deadly bombing of the Indian Embassyin Afghanistan in 2008.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In the view of American spy agencies, Osama bin Laden and a dwindling cadre of Al Qaeda operatives hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no longer ''have the capacity'' to carry out a terror plot similar to the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden's comments provided the latest snapshot of assessments by American intelligence agencies about the shifting landscape of international terrorism. Qaeda operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have, over the past three years, endured a barrage of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, and American officials in recent years have warned that Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate has emerged as the most immediate threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American soil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the unsuccessful attempt to blow up a trans-Atlantic jetliner last Dec. 25, which American officials believe was planned by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- based in Yemen -- Mr. Biden said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States were now ''more likely'' to be hatched outside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These ''smaller bore'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while potentially deadly, are a sign that Qaeda leaders have had to lower their ambitions, Mr. Biden said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Does that mean we've succeeded? No,'' the vice president said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''Does that mean that we're in much better shape than we were a year ago and two and three? Yes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration in recent weeks took pains to cite progress in the war in Afghanistan in advance of its much-anticipated war strategy review, which was released Thursday. Most terrorism analysts agree that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed off a number of top Qaeda planners, but they also cite recent terrorism scares in major European cities as evidence of the lingering threat from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said the United States was only ''partially succeeding'' in containing the power of Al Qaeda's affiliate groups in Yemen, North Africa, Somalia and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Hoffman, Washington's ''overwhelming preoccupation'' with Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years ''has allowed the threat to expand or mutate elsewhere.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials dispute this assertion -- at least when it comes to Yemen. John O. Brennan, the senior White House counterterrorism official, said in a speech on Friday that the United States has increased American foreign aid to Yemen more than tenfold in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is also trying to bolster the counterterrorism abilities of Yemen's fragile government and has orchestrated unilateral </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against operatives of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a group that Mr. Brennan called ''the most operationally active node of the Al Qaeda network.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent sign of the group's determination to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States by any means possible was the failed plot to hide bombs inside packages sent by air cargo from Yemen to addresses in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. has begun patrolling the skies above Yemen with armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, although they are not believed to have yet carried out any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, with a war raging in Afghanistan and American officials frustrated that militant groups are still able to plot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American troops from across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, American resources can only be stretched so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We remain relentlessly focused on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based Al Qaeda because of the strategic nature of the threat posed by its leadership,'' concluded the White House review of the situation in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Although the global affiliates and allies of Al Qaeda also threaten the U.S. homeland and interests, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan continue to be the operational base for the group that attacked us on 9/11,'' the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one senior White House official put it on Sunday, Al Qaeda's core group in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- while sapped of some of its strength -- still provides ''inspirational leadership'' to the organization's surrogates around the world.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Senior American military commanders in Afghanistan are pushing for an expanded campaign of Special Operations ground raids across the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, a risky strategy reflecting the growing frustration with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts to root out militants there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal, described by American officials in Washington and Afghanistan, would escalate military activities inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the movement of American forces has been largely prohibited because of fears of provoking a backlash.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan has not yet been approved, but military and political leaders say a renewed sense of urgency has taken hold, as the deadline approaches for the Obama administration to begin withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. Even with the risks, military commanders say that using American Special Operations troops could bring an intelligence windfall, if militants were captured, brought back across the border into Afghanistan and interrogated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans are known to have made no more than a handful of forays across the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in operations that have infuriated Pakistani officials. Now, American military officers appear confident that a shift in policy could allow for more routine incursions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's clandestine war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has for the most part been carried out by armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, in recent years, Afghan militias backed by the C.I.A. have carried out a number of secret missions into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. These operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Afghan operatives, known as Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams, have been previously reported as solely intelligence-gathering operations. But interviews in recent weeks revealed that on at least one occasion, the Afghans went on the offensive and destroyed a militant weapons cache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to expand American military activity in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which would almost certainly have to be approved by President Obama himself, would amount to the opening of a new front in the nine-year-old war, which has grown increasingly unpopular among Americans. It would run the risk of angering a Pakistani government that has been an uneasy ally in the war in Afghanistan, particularly if it leads to civilian casualties or highly public confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, one senior American officer said, ''We've never been as close as we are now to getting the go-ahead to go across.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials who described the proposal and the intelligence operations declined to be identified by name discussing classified information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain controversial in Washington, and there may be a debate over the proposal. One senior administration official said he was not in favor of cross-border operations -- which he said have been generally ''counterproductive'' -- unless they were directed against top leaders of Al Qaeda. He expressed concern that political fallout in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could negate any tactical gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, as evidence mounts that Pakistani troops are unlikely to stage a major offensive into the militant stronghold of North Waziristan, where Al Qaeda's top leaders are thought to be taking shelter, United States commanders have renewed their push for approval to send American commando teams into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the results of a review of the strategy in Afghanistan, Obama administration officials said they were considering expanded American operations to deal with threats inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They offered no specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews in Washington and Kabul, American officials said that officers were drawing up plans to begin ground operations to capture or kill leaders from the Taliban and the Haqqani network. American officers say they are particularly eager to capture, as opposed to kill, militant leaders, who they say can offer intelligence to guide future operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before finalizing any plans to increase raids across the border, the Obama administration has already stepped up its air assaults in the tribal areas with an unprecedented number of C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year. Since September, the spy agency has carried out more than 50 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan and elsewhere -- compared with 60 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the preceding eight months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews, the officials offered a more detailed description of two operations since 2008 in which Afghans working under the direction of the C.I.A. -- a militia called the Paktika Defense Force -- crossed the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They also offered a richer account of the activities of these militia groups throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Afghan political leader, one of the raids was initiated to capture a Taliban commander working inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. When the Afghan troops reached the compound, they did not find the Taliban commander, but the Pakistani militants opened fire on them, the Afghan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American official disputed this account, saying that the C.I.A. militias are not sent over the border to capture militant leaders, but merely to gather intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a second raid, the Paktika militia attacked and destroyed a Taliban ammunition depot and returned to base, officials said. Both of the C.I.A.-backed raids were aimed at compounds only a few miles inside Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paktika Defense Force is one of six C.I.A.-trained Afghan militias that serve as a special operations force against insurgents throughout Afghanistan. The other militias operate around the cities of Kandahar, Kabul and Jalalabad as well as in the rural provinces of Khost and Kunar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One American service member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the C.I.A.-backed militia near Khost had recently deployed in the mountains along the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, where it would spend the winter trying to intercept Taliban fighters. So far, the C.I.A.-backed force has proven effective, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The rockets we endured for the past seven months suddenly dried up,'' the service member said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, the American military has had only limited success in its few cross-border operations. In October, an American military helicopter accidently killed a group of Pakistani soldiers during a flight over the border in pursuit of militants. The episode infuriated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government, which temporarily shut down American military supply routes into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Several fuel trucks sitting at the border were destroyed by insurgents, and American officials publicly apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years earlier, in September 2008, American commandos carried out a raid in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and killed several people suspected of being insurgents. The episode led to outrage among </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders -- and warnings not to try again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When, and under what conditions, American troops can leave Afghanistan depends in no small measure on Lt. Gen. William Caldwell IV, who is spending a second Christmas in Kabul away from his three young children. As the leader of the NATO training mission, he is charged with fielding a competent army and national police force that (in theory) will eventually replace American and NATO troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much of what is happening in Afghanistan, this is a blurry picture. President George W. Bush never invested the resources to build a serious Afghan security force, so General Caldwell had minimal time to make maximum effort when he took over one year ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team has made impressive gains. The Afghan Army grew from 97,000 to 138,000 troops, the national police expanded from 95,000 to 120,000 officers and an incipient air force is taking shape. They made salaries more competitive and boosted recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are still short 700 trainers. (Maybe Canada will fill the gap.) They are still losing too many trained Afghan forces to attrition. And they need to quickly produce more officers. They are also struggling to provide basic reading skills to the 86 percent of recruits who are illiterate. If Afghans can't read maps, General Caldwell told me, they can't tell the Americans where they are if they need emergency medical evacuation or airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO forces, backed by 30,000 extra American troops and Afghan units, are making progress in jointly clearing critical provinces in the Taliban heartland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit by Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a group of journalists last week to Camp Hansen near Marja in Helmand Province and Forward Operating Base Wilson in Kandahar Province, American commanders spoke in detail about repelling the insurgents and extending local control. Still, the hundreds of American troops at these remote outposts are taking fire daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been made of the significant and necessary escalation in C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- 50 since September compared with 60 in the previous eight months across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where Al Qaeda and Taliban escape to their safe havens. ''If they couldn't get from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it would be all over,'' said Col. David Furness of the Marines. That is overly optimistic, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refusal to close down the sanctuaries is a serious weak spot in the war effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every aspect of a comprehensive strategy, not just the killing and the training, must be ramped up, and Gen. David Petraeus, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, knows it. NATO troops are creating opportunities for improved local governance as well as long-neglected water and agricultural projects, schools and health clinics so Afghans do not ally with the Taliban. So is the American-financed, Afghan-run National Solidarity Program that has created self-governing councils in 30,000 villages and 50,000 local projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their efforts are undermined by President Hamid Karzai's corrupt government, which too often fails to send people to run local and district government offices and appointed corrupt or inept provincial and district governors. Also, the government's lack of a mechanism to adjudicate land disputes leaves people reliant on Taliban religious courts that dispense speedy, popular justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO's decision to keep fighting until 2014 -- when Afghans are supposed to take over security responsibilities -- seems to have changed the calculus in one way. All sides now know that the allied forces are staying around. The militants are under pressure and ''a platform for success has been created,'' said Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister who advises Mr. Karzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope he's right. But five days in Afghanistan offered reminders of the overwhelming challenges that remain. Even American military commanders say the recent gains are reversible. They won't know until the spring or summer whether they can be made permanent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A Taliban group forced into a remote border area by Pakistani military operations struck back Friday with a large and highly coordinated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the government's paramilitary forces, Pakistani officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior security official said about 150 militants initiated the simultaneous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on five security outposts near the Afghan border, killing 11 members of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frontier Corps and wounding 9. The militants fought hand-to-hand battles with the Pakistani forces at two of the outposts in Mohmand Agency and assaulted the three others with machine guns and rockets, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militants may have been trying to forestall new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the military, which has swept them from other nearby tribal areas into a relatively small area of Mohmand Agency and threatened a new offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Frankly, we didn't expect an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of this scale and magnitude,'' said the senior security official, who added that the Pakistani forces had received a warning of an impending assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As violence has flared in Mohmand in recent months, most of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against government forces have been smaller scale ambushes of patrols or remote assaults using improvised bombs planted along roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior security official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said that 24 militants were killed in the hours of clashes, although only 8 militants' bodies were shown to the local news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our assessment is based on militants' intercepts and chatter,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has directed most of its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Haqqani network of the Afghan Taliban, one of the most lethal groups attacking NATO and allied forces in Afghanistan, as well as that group's local Pakistani allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, meanwhile, has been focusing its military operations against groups like the one in Mohmand, which has been attacking Pakistani forces and increasingly singling out civilians allied with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government official said that Taliban fighters in the area had now been driven into a small mountainous area of Mohmand that adjoins the Bajaur tribal area in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Kunar Province in eastern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area offers easy escape routes into Afghanistan, which has allowed the militants to sometimes shelter there, the reverse of the movements of Haqqani fighters who take refugee in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''All the bad guys are now there,'' said Amjad Ali Khan, the administrator of the Mohmand region. ''Kunar's border region has gone to the dogs due to the absence of international forces there. These guys go there and come back to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on our forward positions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunar has a long, mountainous and remote border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is difficult to patrol fully. Some posts are staffed by coalition forces, while others are the responsibility of the Afghan border police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials said that the authorities had planned an operation to flush militants from the remaining pockets of Mohmand, but delayed operations because of a lack of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 6, two suicide bombers dressed as police officers struck the administrative headquarters of Mohmand Agency, killing 43 people and wounding more than 60.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is fairly straightforward to summarize the past year in Iraq and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but a more complicated matter for Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the year of two big developments in Iraq: the major reduction in American combat forces and a protracted election in which voting in March was followed by a nine-month delay in forming a new government. Despite the political confusion, violence did not escalate, and the economy continued to make slow progress. Still, Iraq cannot afford as much stalemate in the coming year as it experienced in 2010, and the new government will need to deliver security, public services and economic growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a rougher year. The summer floods may have displaced more people than any other natural catastrophe in history. The good news is that the government's war against the Pakistani Taliban showed some progress, if not in reducing overall violence levels then at least in terms of establishing greater control over what had been insurgent strongholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regrettably, however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> level of cooperation with the United States against Afghan extremist groups did not show measurable progress in 2010 and may even have slipped somewhat, despite the increase in effective American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government continued to lose ground at home politically as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghanistan saw the completion of the American and NATO troop surges that were the focal point of President Obama's December 2009 policy decision. Afghan security forces grew both in number and quality, and NATO clarified its plan to keep partnering with them through 2014. And while September's parliamentary elections were marred by fraud, this time it was primarily Afghans who held other Afghans accountable in the aftermath -- demonstrating some fledgling aspects of a working democratic system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabul and its environs are reasonably secure and under the general control of Afghan Army and police forces, not NATO troops. But the insurgents have proved resilient, as indicated by trends in violence. Extremist sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain a major problem despite Washington's increased aid to that country. And corruption in the Kabul government remains endemic. In sum, the war's basic trajectory remains unclear.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The deadliest group of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan has not conducted a complex large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the capital city of Kabul for seven months, its momentum stymied as elite American-led commandos have escalated raids against the militants' bomb makers and logisticians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a testament to the resiliency of the fighters, the so-called Haqqani network, and a nod to the fragility of the allied gains, the White House is not trumpeting this assessment. Instead, it is tucked into a classified portion of the Obama administration's year-end review of its Afghanistan war strategy, and senior American officials speak of it in cautious terms, as if not wanting to jinx the positive trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is because even in its weakened state, the network remains the most formidable enemy that American troops face in Afghanistan, and the group is showing signs of adapting its tactics and shifting its combatants to counter the allied strategy, American commanders say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They're financed better, they're better trained and they're the ones who bring in the higher-end I.E.D.'s,'' said Maj. Gen. John F. Campbell, the top allied commander in eastern Afghanistan, referring to improvised explosive devices, or homemade bombs, which the Haqqanis have employed with lethal efficiency in the past several years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, much of the war in Afghanistan, particularly in the rugged eastern part, is a war against the Haqqani family, whose patriarch, Jalaluddin Haqqani, was a legendary guerrilla fighter in the Central Intelligence Agency-backed campaign to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan in the 1980s. His son Sirajuddin now runs the group's daily operations from his haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and he has made aggressive efforts to recruit foreign fighters from the Persian Gulf and elsewhere in Central Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Haqqani network is considered a part of the Afghan Taliban, and is a key ally and protector of Al Qaeda's top leadership, whose members are believed to be hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remote border regions. American and other Western intelligence officials believe that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, shields the Haqqanis in exchange for the network's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archrival, India, in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American intelligence officials say that the Haqqani network planned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2008 in Kabul against the Serena Hotel and the Indian Embassy. It has also been linked to the suicide bombing of a C.I.A. outpost in Khost last December, and has held an American soldier, Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, since he was kidnapped after walking off his Army base in Paktika Province in June 2009. The Haqqanis finance their operations with timber smuggling, kidnapping ransoms and donations from wealthy Persian Gulf individuals, intelligence officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO commanders and senior Obama administration officials take heart in the fact that the Haqqanis have not conducted a complicated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kabul since a suicide bomber steered his explosives-laden Toyota minibus into an American convoy on May 18. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 18 people, including 5 American soldiers and an officer from Canada, and wounded at least 47 civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allied officials attribute the tactical success to several factors. A sixfold increase in the past year in the number of Special Operations raids against insurgents, including the Haqqanis, has disrupted the militants' operations. In the past three months alone, commandos have carried out 1,784 missions across Afghanistan, killing or capturing 880 insurgent leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one-third of those operations were directed against the Haqqani network, a senior NATO official said. He and two other NATO officials agreed to speak candidly about current operations if they weren't quoted by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, 5,400 additional American ground forces have been deployed to eastern Afghanistan, bringing the total there to nearly 37,000. Combined with increased Afghan army, police and intelligence service operations in and around Kabul, the troop surge has hampered the Haqqani network's ability to run suicide bombers in a crucial corridor between Kabul and Khost, adjacent to the group's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sanctuary, allied commanders and independent counterinsurgency specialists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're going after their networks -- the I.E.D. suppliers and bomb makers, and lead fighters,'' said the senior NATO official in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help offset the withdrawal of some troops from isolated outposts in the east, NATO has increased surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights and positioned 68 tethered balloons with cameras and other sensors along the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a senior allied official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself, 99 of the 112 airstrikes launched by C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year have been directed at North Waziristan, the operations hub for the Haqqanis as well as one of their Waziri allies, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, according to Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, a Web site that monitors the war in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet so wily and tenacious are the Haqqanis that Kabul is rife with rumors that their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the capital have subsided for other reasons. One suggests that President Hamid Karzai's government is paying the Haqqanis not to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while another suggests that the ISI has told the Haqqanis to back off in order to keep them in the mix for any Afghan reconciliation talks. NATO, Afghan and Pakistani officials deny such maneuvering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American and NATO officials say the increased operations have degraded the Haqqani network in its stronghold of Paktia, Paktika and Khost Provinces, but not its ability to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While targeting multiple training camps and rat lines have yielded short-term gains, the resilience of the HQN in the area has made quantifying these gains difficult,'' a second NATO official said in an e-mail, using the abbreviation for the Haqqanis. ''The network continues to recruit fighters and take measures to conceal the extent of damage to their capacity. At this point, the effort has disrupted, rather than dislodged the Haqqani network.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report on the Haqqani network by the Institute for the Study of War, a research organization here, concluded: ''The population that Haqqani relies on for recruits, shelter and support has grown increasingly frustrated with the preponderance of civilian casualties and the death of recruits in Haqqani-linked operations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of their resiliency, the Haqqanis are moving north and west to avoid the Special Operations raids and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and take advantage of ties to family and criminal networks there, American intelligence officials say. ''The insurgents are taking advantage of targets of opportunity and responding to pressure, rather than any concerted efforts to try to expand their influence,'' the second NATO official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, American commanders say the Haqqani network has shifted from staging complex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against targets in Kabul, to smaller suicide-bombings and a series of furious, largely successful assaults this past summer against remote American outposts near the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 19, Haqqani-linked insurgents armed with AK-47s and grenades opened fire on a bus carrying Afghan army trainers. One attacker ran into the bus and blew himself up, killing five officers and wounding nine others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan and allied commanders say that the increased raids against the Haqqani network are just a piece of the broader counterinsurgency strategy of Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Afghanistan, and the Karzai government, to win over the population with good governance and economic opportunity, as well as with improved security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this puts the United States in direct competition with the Haqqanis. ''The Haqqani network's goal remains territory,'' said a third NATO official in Kabul. ''While it does not have the capacity to unseat the government in Kabul, nor to really govern, it wants to seize territory because that allows it to generate income 'Mafia-like.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food Aid Cut After Bombing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (AP) -- About 300,000 villagers impoverished by fighting in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal belt are scrambling to find food after a suicide bombing that killed 45 people outside a World Food Program center prompted a suspension of the relief project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a sign of insurgent desperation, but the bombing challenged Islamabad's claims of victory over Al Qaeda and the Taliban in this part of the border with Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shahab Khan, World Food Program district coordinator, said Sunday that its four centers in the Bajaur tribal region had been shut since Saturday's bombing. The centers feed the 300,000 people who returned to the district from camps for the displaced elsewhere in the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Rival militant organizations on both sides of the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border have increasingly been teaming up in deadly raids, in what military and intelligence officials say is the insurgents' latest attempt to regain the initiative after months of withering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from American and allied forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New intelligence assessments from the region assert that insurgent factions now are setting aside their historic rivalries to behave like ''a syndicate,'' joining forces in ways not seen before. After one recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a remote base in eastern Afghanistan, a check of the dead insurgents found evidence that the fighters were from three different factions, military officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, these insurgent groups have been seen as sharing ideology and inspiration, but less often plans for specific missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the intelligence assessments offer evidence of a worrisome new trend in which extremist commanders and their insurgent organizations are coordinating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and even combining their foot soldiers into patchwork patrols sent to carry out specific raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change reveals the resilience and flexibility of the militant groups. But at the same time, officials say, the unusual and expanding alliances suggest that the factions are feeling new military pressure. American and NATO officials say these decisions by insurgent leaders are the result of operations by American, Afghan and allied forces on one side of the border, and by the Pakistani military -- and American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American commanders recently have been seeking even more latitude to operate freely along the porous border, including inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and have consistently warned that whatever gains they have made in the past few months are fragile. One official said it was ''a wake-up call'' to find evidence, after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the forward operating base, that the fighters were partisans from three factions with long histories of feuding: the Quetta Shura Taliban of Mullah Muhammad Omar; the network commanded by the Haqqani family; and fighters loyal to the Hekmatyar clan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These extremist groups have begun granting one another safe passage through their areas of control in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sharing new recruits and coordinating their propaganda responses to American and allied actions on the ground, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American military officials sought to cast these recent developments as a reaction to changes in the American and allied strategies in the past year, including aggressive military offensives against the insurgents coupled with attempts to provide visible and reliable protection to the local Afghan population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They have been forced to cooperate due to the effect our collective efforts have had on them,'' said Lt. Col. Patrick R. Seiber, a spokesman for American and coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Seiber said insurgent commanders recognized that as the number of American forces increased this year in Afghanistan, ''they would need to surge as well.'' Veteran militant leaders, many with a long history of open warfare against one another, have ''put aside differences when they see a common threat,'' Colonel Seiber said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 90 days, signs of this new and advanced syndication among insurgent groups have been especially evident in two provinces of eastern Afghanistan, Kunar and Paktika. Pentagon and military officials said they had no specific count of these combined </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but said the syndicated nature of cooperative action went beyond just the raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased cooperation among insurgent factions also is being reported inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where many of the extremist organizations are based or where their leaders have found a haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American and NATO officials said they had seen evidence of loose cooperation among other insurgent groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-i-Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashkar is a Punjabi group and is considered one of the most serious long-term threats inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Punjabi groups, many of which were created by Pakistani intelligence to fight against India's interests in Kashmir, now appear to be teaming up with Pashtun groups like the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban to fight their creators, the Pakistani intelligence and security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon and military officials who routinely engage with their Pakistani counterparts said officials in Islamabad, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capital, agreed with the new American and NATO assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is actually a syndicate of related and associated militant groups and networks,'' said one American officer, summarizing the emerging view of Pakistani officials. ''Trying to parse them, as if they have firewalls in between them, is really kind of silly. They cooperate with each other. They franchise work with each other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of senior leaders of Al Qaeda, who are believed to be hiding in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, remains important as well, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are part of this very complex collusion that occurs between all of these extremist groups,'' one American official said. ''Each group provides certain value to the syndicate. Al Qaeda senior leadership provides ideological inspiration and a brand name -- which is not all that tangible, frankly, but it's still pretty important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the loose federation was not managed by a traditional military command-and-control system, but was more akin to a social network of relationships that rose and faded as the groups decided on ways to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afghan, Pakistani, American and NATO interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these expanding relationships among insurgent groups are foremost a response to increased American and allied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> another motivation is eliminating the need for each group to guard its physical territory and money-generating interests from the other extremist organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They do not want to have to defend that against each other,'' one NATO officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer cited information gathered on the ground confirming that insurgent groups now allowed rivals free passage through their areas of control in exchange for that right across the other group's turf. There also is intelligence pointing to threads of financing that run from senior Qaeda leaders and then pass among several of the insurgent organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commanders also warn of another response to the increase of American troop levels in Afghanistan: larger numbers of insurgent foot soldiers are expected to be ordered to remain in Afghanistan this winter to fight on, rather than retreat to havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to await the spring thaw and a return to combat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What our intelligence is telling us, we're probably going to see about a 15 to 20 percent increase in the amount of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> compared to the same time frame of 2009,'' said Maj. Gen. John F. Campbell, commander of American and allied forces in eastern Afghanistan. ''We think many are going to stay and try to fight.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When conflicts are broken down by numbers, things tend to be obscured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To what extent has United States technology and manpower been deployed in Yemen during 2010? That question is not taken up in the Op-Chart, which would have benefited from significant details like the number of United States covert actions in Yemen, the amount of dollars Washington gave Sana to train the Yemeni special operations forces, and how many Yemenis think American policy is headed in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemen must not be ignored, especially as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> creeps onto the list of states where the United States is launching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I would venture to guess that the policy of American surveillance and reconnaissance missions in Yemen, which Yemeni sources contend includes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not winning hearts and minds on the Arabian Peninsula.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A suicide bomber struck in a tribal area of northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, ramming his explosives-laden vehicle into a mosque adjacent to a police station that has come under frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the last few months, a security official said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombing came as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived in Islamabad for bilateral talks with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civil and military leadership. It was timed to evening prayers, and brought down the roof of both buildings, the security official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A doctor at a regional hospital said 18 bodies had arrived so far. At least 17 people were reported injured. It was unclear how many police officers were among the dead and injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bannu District, has long been violent. It borders North Waziristan, which Pakistani security officials acknowledge is the hub of Pakistani militants and their Al Qaeda associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security official, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that the bomber appeared to have come from a semi-autonomous tribal region called Janikhel, which is close to North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the banned Pakistani Taliban group, Tehrik-i-Taliban, told a reporter in Bannu that the bombing was aimed at venting anger over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pro U.S policies. ''More bombings would follow,'' said the spokesman, Ihsanullah Ihsan, in a call from an undisclosed location, according to the reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired two missiles into a compound in Mirali, North Waziristan, on Wednesday, killing five suspected militants, a local official said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met for talks here on Wednesday with top civilian and military leaders, looking to reinforce a strategic partnership with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to reassure a skeptical nation of American intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Mr. Biden's first trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as vice president, intended to signal both the United States' unbroken commitment after the sudden death in December of Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to the region, and its high-level concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As American officials have for months, Mr. Biden was likely to use the occasion to push the Pakistani military for operations in North Waziristan, where insurgents run a virtual ministate, training militants and organizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against NATO forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials say they want to undertake the offensive when they choose, but for American officials, looking to lock in tentative gains in Afghanistan, time is of the essence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Largely successful American operations this fall in southern Afghanistan pushed many Taliban across the border to Baluchistan Province in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. American officials will now be seeking Pakistani cooperation in preventing the Taliban from returning to Afghanistan to fight in the spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Biden's public remarks indicated that he also wanted to continue to shift relations to a broader, longer-term agenda, including economic assistance, and to move the two countries away from what he described as a ''transactional'' relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, Mr. Biden sought to dispel what he described as misconceptions about the United States in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including that it was anti-Islam. He dismissed notions that the United States wanted to dismantle or weaken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that it favored India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archrival. He emphasized that the United States would not abandon the country, as many Pakistanis feel it did in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He underscored the threat of extremism and rebuffed criticism that the United States was violating Pakistani sovereignty, saying it was instead groups like Al Qaeda that had done so. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States have forged a partnership against extreme ideologies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our relationship, in my view and the view of President Obama, is absolutely vital, absolutely vital, to the interest of the United States, and I believe you believe it is vital to the Pakistani interest as well,'' Mr. Biden said in remarks to reporters broadcast live on state-run television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are those who accuse the United States of violating your sovereignty,'' he added. ''I respectfully suggest that it is the extremists who violate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty and corrupt its good name.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the United States would work with Pakistani leaders ''to restore and strengthen sovereignty in those areas of the country where extremists had violated it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only productive way forward for the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, is ''a long-term, enduring partnership.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House's strategic review of policy in December made particular mention of the need for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do more to eliminate havens for extremist groups. American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which have provoked popular outcries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over its sovereignty, have degraded Al Qaeda, but progress remains uneven, the review said. ''Furthermore,'' it stated, ''the denial of extremist safe havens cannot be achieved with military means alone, but must continue to be advanced by effective development strategies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The competing forces squeezing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were on full display on Wednesday. Eighteen people were killed when a suicide bomber in a district adjacent to North Waziristan rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a mosque during evening prayers, according to a security official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired two missiles into a compound in Mirali, in North Waziristan, killing five people believed to be militants, a local official said. Given the success of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan, Mr. Biden may also push to expand their use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vice president took no questions, saying he was late for a meeting with the country's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, was expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden met with President Asif Ali Zardari. ''The atmosphere of the meeting was good,'' said Farahnaz Ispahani, media adviser to Mr. Zardari, who was present then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden said he had made a telephone call to express condolences to Aamna Taseer, the wife of the Punjab governor, Salman Taseer, who was assassinated by a religious extremist on Jan. 4. ''Societies that tolerate such actions end up being consumed by those actions,'' he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari, in turn, expressed hopes for an early recovery for Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who remained in critical condition after being shot in Tucson on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a week in which economic reforms all but collapsed as the prime minister sought to hold together his coalition government, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zardari also discussed the economy. However, Ms. Ispahani said Mr. Biden announced no concrete aid package before he left for Baghdad, where he touched down early Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refusal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants in a notorious sanctuary on its northwest border may have created a magnet there for hundreds of Islamic fighters seeking a safe haven where they can train and organize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against NATO forces in Afghanistan. But theirs is a congregation in the cross hairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing number of senior United States intelligence and counterinsurgency officials say that by bunching up there, insurgents are ultimately making it easier for American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hit them from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials are loath to talk about this silver lining to the storm cloud that they have long described building up in the tribal area of North Waziristan, where the insurgents run a virtual mini-state the size of Rhode Island. This is because they do not want to undermine the Obama administration's urgent public pleas for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to order troops into the area, or to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an excuse for inaction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We cannot succeed in Afghanistan without shutting down those safe havens,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week, underscoring a major conclusion of the White House's strategic review of Afghanistan policy last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as long as the safe havens exist, they provide a rich hunting ground, however inadvertent it may be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani Army operations in the other six of seven tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan have helped drive fighters from Al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban, the Haqqani network and other militant groups into North Waziristan, the one tribal area that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not yet assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With several hundred insurgents largely bottled up there, and with few worries about accidentally hitting Pakistani soldiers battling militants or civilians fleeing a combat zone, the Central Intelligence Agency's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have attacked targets in North Waziristan with increasing effectiveness and have degraded Al Qaeda's ability to carry out a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States, the senior officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan grew to 104 in 2010 from 22 in 2009, according to the Long War Journal, a Web site that tracks the wars in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There have been five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the overall effectiveness of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is impossible to ascertain, there are many accounts to confirm that insurgent fighters and leaders have indeed been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, a wide array of administration officials have acknowledged the limitations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and emphasized the need for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use ground troops to clear out militants who have used the refuge in North Waziristan to rest and rearm, a point Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made to Pakistani civilian leaders and ranking generals on a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior counterterrorism official concurred, saying: ''We've seen in the past what happens when terrorists are given a de facto safe haven. It tends to turn out ugly for both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States. It's absolutely critical that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stay focused on rooting out militants in North Waziristan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, discussed counterterrorism issues with the president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Asif Ali Zardari, and the head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy agency, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, in a meeting in Washington on Friday, a C.I.A. spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But half a dozen senior intelligence, counterterrorism and military officials interviewed in the past several days said a bright side had unexpectedly emerged from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delay. Pounding the militants consolidated in the North Waziristan enclave with airstrikes will leave the insurgents in a weakened state if the Pakistani offensive comes later this year, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In some ways, it's to our benefit to keep them bottled up, mostly in North Waziristan,'' said a senior intelligence official, who like others interviewed agreed to speak candidly about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy if he was not identified. ''This is not intentional. That wasn't the design to bottle them up. That's just where they are, and they're there for a reason. They don't have a lot of options.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another senior administration official added, ''We'd still prefer the Pakistani Army to operate in North Waziristan, but consolidating the insurgents in one place is not such a bad thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Pakistani politicians and commanders, including Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief of staff, say their troops are already stretched thin and will carry out an offensive in North Waziristan on their timetable, not Washington's. Lt. Gen. Asif Yasin Malik, the main </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commander in the northwest, said in October that it would take at least six months to clear militants from two other restive tribal areas, called agencies, before considering an offensive in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's only a matter of how, when and in what manner do we conduct operations there,'' Husain Haqqani, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United States, said in a statement. He said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had 38,000 military and paramilitary troops in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior United States officials praise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for carrying out operations in the rugged tribal areas, but many of these officials say they are not convinced that the Pakistani Army is willing or able to clear North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counterterrorism specialists say that attacking militants in North Waziristan would be a much more difficult campaign than previous operations in Swat, Bajaur and South Waziristan. The region has mountainous terrain as well as urban centers, like Miram Shah, that if attacked could result in many civilian casualties or produce hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting, as happened in previous clearing operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, no effective civilian police force exists to take over security duties after military operations. The Pakistani Army still remains in Swat, Bajaur and South Waziristan, months after major campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to be truly effective, American officials say, a North Waziristan offensive would have to single out not just Qaeda and Taliban fighters, but also militants in the Haqqani network. That group has long enjoyed support from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence services because it represents a strategic hedge against what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views as encroachment by its archrival, India, in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There may be an offensive in North Waziristan, but I think it'll be very carefully orchestrated to preserve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assets in the region,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who led President Obama's first Afghanistan policy review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American intelligence officials say that pressure from the airstrikes has forced small numbers of Haqqani fighters and other militants to slip into other tribal areas, including Kurram and South Waziristan. ''The Haqqanis aren't stupid,'' one counterterrorism official said. ''They're feeling some serious pressure in North Waziristan, so it should come as no surprise that they're looking for places they might think are safer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the more reason proponents of Pakistani action say time is of the essence. ''I've been very clear in my conversations with General Kayani over the last year or so that there needs to be a focus, from my perspective, on North Waziristan,'' Admiral Mullen told reporters in Islamabad last month. ''That's where Al Qaeda leadership resides, that's where the Haqqani network, in particular, is headquartered, and the Haqqanis are leading the way and coming across the border and killing American and allied forces. And that has got to cease.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Nine years after the American reporter Daniel Pearl was captured and killed by operatives of Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, more than a dozen of the militants involved in his murder remain at large, a testament to the lack of will by Pakistani authorities to prosecute the cases, according to a report released Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the 14 men who are known to have played a role in the death of Mr. Pearl, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, committed other terrorist acts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a hotel in Karachi in which 11 French engineers were killed, and the attempted assassination of the former president, Pervez Musharraf, the report says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior Pakistani law enforcement official who was closely involved in the Pearl case and worked with American investigators confirmed in an interview on Thursday that the 14 men had not been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani official, who declined to be named because he said he had received death threats from the militants, said there was ''sufficient evidence to link them to Pearl's case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a $1 million question as to where their people are and why they weren't arrested or tried in this case,'' the law enforcement official said. All of the 14 men had committed ''major acts of terrorism'' in the four or five years after the Pearl killing, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder of Mr. Pearl has been extensively documented and discussed as an emblem of the post-9/11 era. A movie, ''A Mighty Heart,'' with Angelina Jolie, popularized the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unanswered questions persisted, gaps that the new report, based on investigative work by students and faculty at the journalism program of Georgetown University and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the Center for Public Integrity, tries to fill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi on Jan. 23, 2002, as he was pursuing a story about Islamic extremism. He was beheaded in early February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British Pakistani, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, and three others were convicted and sentenced to death by a Pakistani court in July 2002. The four men remain in prison in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were involved in the plot to abduct Mr. Pearl but were not responsible for his actual murder in a compound deep in the slums of Karachi, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, the Qaeda operative Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is awaiting trial in connection with the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confessed to killing Mr. Pearl, according to a transcript of a hearing released by American officials. Mr. Mohammed has not been indicted for the murder, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comparison of a photograph of the veins in the hand that beheaded Mr. Pearl shown in a video of his death and a photograph of the veins in Mr. Mohammed's hand taken at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison showed that Mr. Mohammed had indeed killed Mr. Pearl, the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Mr. Pearl melded operatives of Al Qaeda with technically proficient Pakistani militant groups, a combination that turned out to be the beginning of a lethal alliance that grew stronger and has tormented </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ever since, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The murder was the first known operation in which Pakistani militants collaborated with Al Qaeda,'' it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the groups involved in Mr. Pearl's murder, Lashkar-e-Janghvi, became a crucial player in the Punjabi Taliban, a confederation of groups now holed up with Al Qaeda in the tribal area of North Waziristan. Those groups are now major targets of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashkar-e-Janghvi masterminded the assault on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army headquarters in 2009 that deeply embarrassed the Pakistani military. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was run by a wing of Lashkar-e-Janghvi named after Amjad Farooqi, who was identified by Pakistani authorities as one of Mr. Pearl's kidnappers. Mr. Farooqi was killed in a shootout in southern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the 14 men who remain free, the report names Abdul Hayee. In 2003, Mr. Hayee was arrested for killing six Shiites, members of the minority Islam sect in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He was acquitted and lives in Punjab Province, according to a Pakistani police official interviewed for the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another militant, Mohammad Sohail, who worked with Mr. Farooqi on the Pearl abduction, was sentenced to death in 2003 for his role in the 2002 bombing in Karachi that killed the French engineers, the report says. He was acquitted on appeal in 2009, and is now free, it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another militant, Malik Tassadaq Hussain, who the report says took photos of Mr. Pearl that were distributed in an e-mail during his captivity, was arrested in 2004 but never charged. He was later charged for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a police van and acquitted in 2007, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani lawyer, Ahmer Bilal Soofi, who has studied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-terrorism laws, said that the laws were deeply flawed and that many cases were thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Police officers were rarely given enough time or resources to carry out proper investigations, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''An investigating officer just throws whatever evidence he has in court,'' Mr. Soofi said. ''His superior lauds him and says we've taken the case to court. But in the process they have compromised the case.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez, the No. 2 commander in Afghanistan, said Tuesday that the United States and NATO could succeed in the war even if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refused to shut down a lawless frontier sanctuary that militants use for staging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on forces across the border in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In comments that sought to make a virtue of a now-acknowledged reality, General Rodriguez, the NATO and American commander in charge of the day-to-day fighting in Afghanistan, said that while the United States continued to press </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to root out the militants from their haven in the northwest tribal region of North Waziristan, the United States could still win militarily if the Pakistani Army did not act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's not a mission-stopper in my mind,'' General Rodriguez told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. He did not provide a definition of winning militarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general's assessment is the latest evolution in the thinking of American intelligence and counterintelligence officials, who have been long frustrated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but say that the country's inaction has produced at least one unintended benefit: The concentration of so many militants in North Waziristan makes it easier for American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, General Rodriguez's comments are at odds with recent remarks by Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said last month that ''we cannot succeed in Afghanistan without shutting down those safe havens.'' A White House strategic review of Afghan policy in December came to much the same conclusion. Two classified United States intelligence reports late last year similarly concluded that there was a limited chance of success unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hunted down the insurgents near the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said that historically it had often been difficult if not impossible to defeat an insurgency when it enjoyed a cross-border haven. He cited as examples the North Vietnamese, who had havens in Cambodia and Laos during the Vietnam War, and the Algerians, who had havens in Tunisia when they were fighting to gain independence from France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been cross-border havens for insurgents in Iraq as well, Mr. Hoffman said, citing foreign fighters from Syria and Iranian support for Shiite militias. Iraq, Mr. Hoffman said, is so far a qualified success, so with cross-border havens over all ''the historical record isn't benign, but recent history is perhaps a bit kinder.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Rodriguez also said that he did not yet know to what extent the Taliban would be able to reconstitute itself for the spring fighting season after a battering from United States, NATO and Afghan forces late last year. Counterterrorism experts view it as the essential question of how deep the Taliban bench is, which will determine whether President Obama's decision to order an additional 30,000 American forces to Afghanistan in 2010 -- the full complement arrived by September -- has worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Rodriguez did say that he anticipated that the Taliban would regroup in the spring with a new approach. ''I think they're going to come back with a different type of strategy,'' he said, ''which I believe is going to be focused on the leadership much more than it ever has.'' In other words, he said, the Taliban are likely to focus on the assassination of Afghan political leaders and on planting roadside bombs, rather than fighting with American troops -- in part, he suggested, because the battles took a toll on the Taliban in 2010. ''They will not be as direct in their confrontations as they were last year,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But asked if the insurgents were ''on the ropes yet,'' General Rodriguez replied, ''No, the Taliban is not on the ropes yet.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The American arrested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after shooting two men at a crowded traffic stop was part of a covert, C.I.A.-led team collecting intelligence and conducting surveillance on militant groups deep inside the country, according to American government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working from a safe house in the eastern city of Lahore, the detained American contractor, Raymond A. Davis, a retired Special Forces soldier, carried out scouting and other reconnaissance missions as a security officer for the Central Intelligence Agency case officers and technical experts doing the operations, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis's arrest and detention last month, which came after what American officials have described as a botched robbery attempt, have inadvertently pulled back the curtain on a web of covert American operations inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, part of a secret war run by the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode has exacerbated already frayed relations between the American intelligence agency and its Pakistani counterpart, created a political dilemma for the weak, pro-American Pakistani government, and further threatened the stability of the country, which has the world's fastest growing nuclear arsenal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without describing Mr. Davis's mission or intelligence affiliation, President Obama last week made a public plea for his release. Meanwhile, there have been a flurry of private phone calls to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all intended to persuade the Pakistanis to release the secret operative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis has worked for years as a C.I.A. contractor, including time at Blackwater Worldwide, the private security firm (now called Xe) that Pakistanis have long viewed as symbolizing a culture of American gun-slinging overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times had agreed to temporarily withhold information about Mr. Davis's ties to the agency at the request of the Obama administration, which argued that disclosure of his specific job would put his life at risk. Several foreign news organizations have disclosed some aspects of Mr. Davis's work with the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, American officials lifted their request to withhold publication. George Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, declined to comment specifically on the Davis matter, but said in a statement: ''Our security personnel around the world act in a support role providing security for American officials. They do not conduct foreign intelligence collection or covert operations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the United States is not at war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the American military is largely restricted from operating in the country. So the Central Intelligence Agency has taken on an expanded role, operating armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that kill militants inside the country and running covert operations, sometimes without the knowledge of the Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several American and Pakistani officials said that the C.I.A. team with which Mr. Davis worked in Lahore was tasked with tracking the movements of various Pakistani militant groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, a particularly violent group that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uses as a proxy force against India but that the United States considers a threat to allied troops in Afghanistan. For the Pakistanis, such spying inside their country is an extremely delicate issue, particularly since Lashkar has longstanding ties to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, American and Pakistani officials use Lahore as a base of operations to investigate the militant groups and their madrasas in the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials gave various accounts of the makeup of the covert team and of Mr. Davis, who at the time of his arrest was carrying a Glock pistol, a long-range wireless set, a small telescope and a headlamp. An American and a Pakistani official said in interviews that operatives from the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command had been assigned to the group to help with the surveillance missions. Other American officials, however, said that no military personnel were involved with the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special operations troops routinely work with the C.I.A. in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Among other things, they helped the agency pinpoint the location of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy Taliban commander who was arrested in January 2010 in Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the arrest of Mr. Davis, his C.I.A. affiliation was known to Pakistani authorities, who keep close tabs on the movements of Americans. His visa, presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late 2009, describes his job as a ''regional affairs officer,'' a common job description for officials working with the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to that application, Mr. Davis carried an American diplomatic passport and was listed as ''administrative and technical staff,'' a category that typically grants diplomatic immunity to its holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials said that with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government trying to clamp down on the increasing flow of Central Intelligence Agency officers and contractors trying to gain entry to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, more of these operatives have been granted ''cover'' as embassy employees and given diplomatic passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Davis is held in a jail cell in Lahore -- the subject of an international dispute at the highest levels -- new details are emerging of what happened in a dramatic daytime scene on the streets of central Lahore, a sprawling city, on Jan. 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the American account, Mr. Davis was driving alone in an impoverished area rarely visited by foreigners, and stopped his car at a crowded intersection. Two Pakistani men brandishing weapons hopped off motorcycles and approached. Mr. Davis killed them with the Glock, an act American officials insisted was in self-defense against armed robbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Sunday, the text of the Lahore Police Department's crime report was published in English by a prominent daily newspaper, The Daily Times, and it offered a somewhat different account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is based in part on the version of events Mr. Davis gave Pakistani authorities, and it seems to raise doubts about his claim that the shootings were in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to that report, Mr. Davis told the police that after shooting the two men, he stepped out of the car to take photographs of one of them, then called the United States Consulate in Lahore for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report also said that the victims were shot several times in the back, a detail that some Pakistani officials say proves the killings were murder. By this account, Mr. Davis fired at the men through his windshield, then stepped out of the car and continued firing. The report said that Mr. Davis then got back in his car and ''managed to escape,'' but that the police gave chase and ''overpowered'' him at a traffic circle a short distance away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bizarre twist that has further infuriated the Pakistanis, a third man was killed when an unmarked Toyota Land Cruiser, racing to Mr. Davis's rescue, drove the wrong way down a one-way street and ran over a motorcyclist. As the Land Cruiser drove ''recklessly'' back to the consulate, the report said, items fell out of the vehicle, including 100 bullets, a black mask and a piece of cloth with the American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials have demanded that the Americans in the S.U.V. be turned over to local authorities, but American officials say they have already left the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis and the other Americans were heavily armed and carried sophisticated equipment, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Foreign Office, generally considered to work under the guidance of the ISI, has declined to grant Mr. Davis what it calls the ''blanket immunity'' from prosecution that diplomats enjoy. In a setback for Washington, the Lahore High Court last week gave the Pakistani government until March 14 to decide on Mr. Davis's immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-American government led by President Asif Ali Zardari, fearful for its survival in the face of a surge of anti-American sentiment, has resisted strenuous pressure from the Obama administration to release Mr. Davis to the United States. Some militant and religious groups have demanded that Mr. Davis be tried in the Pakistani courts and hanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between the two spy agencies were tense even before the episode on the streets of Lahore. In December, the C.I.A.'s top clandestine officer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hurriedly left the country after his identity was revealed. Some inside the agency believe that ISI operatives were behind the disclosure -- retribution for the head of the ISI, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, being named in a New York City lawsuit filed in connection with the 2008 terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, in which members of his agency are believed to have played a role. ISI officials denied that was the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior Pakistani official close to the ISI said Pakistani spies were particularly infuriated over the Davis episode because it was such a public spectacle. Besides the three Pakistanis who were killed, the widow of one of the victims committed suicide by swallowing rat poison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the official said, the case was embarrassing for the ISI for its flagrancy, revealing how much freedom American spies have to roam around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We all know the spy-versus-spy games, we all know it works in the shadows,'' the official said, ''but you don't get caught, and you don't get caught committing murders.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis, burly at 36, appears to have arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in late 2009 or early 2010. American officials said he operated as part of the Central Intelligence Agency's Global Response Staff in various parts of the country, including Lahore and Peshawar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents released by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Office showed that Mr. Davis was paid $200,000 a year, including travel expenses and insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a native of rural southwest Virginia, described by those who know him as an unlikely figure to be at the center of international intrigue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He grew up in Big Stone Gap, a small town named after the gap in the mountains where the Powell River emerges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youngest of three children, Mr. Davis enlisted in the military after graduating from Powell Valley High School in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I guess about any man's dream is to serve his country,'' his sister Michelle Wade said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shrugging off the portrait of him as an international spy comfortable with a Glock, Ms. Wade said: ''He would always walk away from a fight. That's just who he is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His high school friends remember him as good-natured, athletic, respectful. He was also a protector, they said, the type who stood up for the underdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Friends with everyone, just a salt of the earth person,'' said Jennifer Boring, who graduated from high school with Mr. Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis served in the infantry in Europe -- including a short tour as a peacekeeper in Macedonia -- before joining the Third Special Forces Group in 1998, where he remained until he left the Army in 2003. The Army Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets -- are an elite group trained in weapons and foreign languages and cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear when Mr. Davis began working for the C.I.A., but American officials said that in recent years he worked for the spy agency as a Blackwater contractor and later founded his own small company, Hyperion Protective Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis and his wife have moved frequently, living in Las Vegas, Arizona and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One neighbor in Colorado, Gary Sollee, said that Mr. Davis described himself as ''former military,'' adding that ''he'd have to leave the country for work pretty often, and when he's gone, he's gone for an extended period of time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis's sister, Ms. Wade, said she was awaiting her brother's safe return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The only thing I'm going to say is I love my brother,'' she said. ''I love my brother, God knows, I love him. I'm just praying for him.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief spy agency has demanded an accounting by the Central Intelligence Agency of all its contractors working in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a fallout from the arrest last month of an American involved in surveillance of militant groups, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angered that the American, Raymond A. Davis, worked as a contractor in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on covert C.I.A. operations without the knowledge of the Pakistanis, the spy agency estimated that there were ''scores'' more such contractors ''working behind our backs,'' said the official, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about a delicate matter between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a slight softening of the Pakistani stance since Mr. Davis's arrest, the official said that the American and Pakistani intelligence agencies needed to continue cooperation, and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was prepared to put the episode in the past if the C.I.A. stopped treating its Pakistani counterparts as inferior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Treat us as allies, not as satellites,'' said the official of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. ''Respect, equality and trust are needed.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, said the American spy agency's ties to the ISI ''have been strong over the years, and when there are issues to sort out, we work through them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's the sign of a healthy partnership,'' Mr. Little said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest and detention of Mr. Davis, 36, after he shot and killed two motorcyclists in Lahore soured already testy relations between two governments that are supposed to have a common front in the fight against terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top American and Pakistani military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and the leader of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, met this week in Oman, where the Davis case was discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report by a former head of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, who runs a research and analysis center based in Lahore, both sides agreed to try to ''arrest the downhill descent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, the Pakistani intelligence community was divided over how quickly to settle the Davis case and how much to extract from the C.I.A., said a Pakistani official with intimate knowledge of the situation, who declined to be named because of the delicacy of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a minimum, the ISI wants an accounting of all the contractors who work for the C.I.A. in roles that have not been defined to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a general rewriting of the rules of engagement by the C.I.A. in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another sign that the two spy services were trying to patch up their differences, Leon E. Panetta, the director of the C.I.A., spoke on Wednesday with Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the ISI director, about resolving Mr. Davis's case, American and Pakistani officials said on Friday. Mr. Davis, who appeared in handcuffs on Friday for a hearing in a closed courtroom at the jail where he is being held in Lahore, faces possible murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration insists that Mr. Davis has diplomatic immunity and should be released. The Pakistani government has left the determination on diplomatic immunity to the Foreign Office and a hearing before the Lahore High Court on March 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some senior Pakistani intelligence officers were unwilling to have Mr. Davis released under almost any circumstances, said the official with knowledge of the split in the intelligence community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said others wanted to use the Davis case as a bargaining chip to get the withdrawal of a civil lawsuit filed in Brooklyn last year that implicates the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, in the November 2008 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for the C.I.A. to acknowledge the number of contractors in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was driven by the suspicion that the American spy service had slipped many such secret operatives into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the past six months, the senior ISI official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase occurred after a directive last July by the Pakistani civilian government, which is often at odds with the ISI, to its Washington embassy to expedite visas without supervision from the ISI or the Ministry of Interior, the senior ISI official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The behavior of people like Mr. Davis is deeply embarrassing to the ISI because it makes the agency ''look like fools'' in the eyes of the anti-American Pakistani public, the ISI official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Davis case made it hard to explain to Pakistanis why the ISI was cooperating with Washington, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clampdown on American contractors by the Pakistani authorities appeared to be under way Friday with the arrest of an American citizen, Aaron Mark DeHaven, in the northwestern city of Peshawar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Peshawar police said Mr. DeHaven was detained because he had overstayed his business visa after his request for an extension last October was turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no immediate accusation that Mr. DeHaven worked for the American government, a security official in Peshawar said. But the arrest of Mr. DeHaven, who is married to a Pakistani woman, appears to be a signal that the Pakistani authorities have decided to expel Americans they have doubts about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security official said Mr. DeHaven owned a firm, Catalyst Services in Peshawar, that rented houses for Americans in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Embassy in Islamabad said in a statement that it did not have details about Mr. DeHaven but that it was arranging consular access for him through the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his first months in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in early 2010, Mr. Davis, the contractor for the C.I.A., was attached to the American Consulate in Peshawar and lived in a house with other Americans in an upscale neighborhood, according to Pakistani officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 20-minute court hearing on Friday, Mr. Davis told the judge he would not take part in the proceedings because he had diplomatic immunity, Pakistani officials told reporters later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to sign the charge sheet presented to him, the officials said. The Obama administration insists that Mr. Davis acted in self-defense when the two motorcyclists tried to rob him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the charge sheet, the Pakistani police said Mr. Davis shot the motorcyclists multiple times from inside his car, and then stepped from the car and continued shooting with his Glock pistol. Mr. Davis then drove from the scene and was arrested several miles away, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Friday Prayers in Lahore and in Islamabad, the capital, anti-American sermons, in some cases laced with references to Mr. Davis, were common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which Mr. Davis is believed to have been conducting surveillance on, said the American was ''a spy, committing terrorism, helping in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banners reading ''Hang Davis'' and ''No immunity to Davis'' were strung across the road adjacent to Mr. Saeed's headquarters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- This year the spring offensive by the Taliban and other insurgent groups has a new and terrifying face: the insurgents are using suicide bombers who create high casualties to sow terror and are planning an assassination campaign as well, Afghan and American military analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurgents' deadly bet is that fear will trump anger and that Afghans will lose any faith they had in their government's security forces and eventually turn to the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have to ask yourself, 'If you were the Taliban now, what would you do?' '' said Gen. Jack Keane, who retired from the Army in 2003 and is now a consultant to Gen. David H. Petraeus, the NATO commander for Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the massing of NATO forces in the south, the answer appears to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the urban, civilian population, creating widespread insecurity in an effort to reinforce the existing resentment of foreign troops and doubts about President Hamid Karzai's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In less than four weeks, 116 Afghans have died in seven suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most recently in Faryab Province on Saturday. Two of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one in Jalalabad on Feb. 19 and another in Kandahar on Feb. 12, involved multiple assailants and were carefully choreographed and skillfully timed to obtain a high death toll and maximum media coverage. In at least one case, the mission was carefully rehearsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a striking change from Afghan suicide bombings of just six months ago, in which the bombers exacted few casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These new tactics highlight the challenge of an adaptive insurgency with a reservoir of potential fighters, many of them madrasa students in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. They show too the increasingly integrated network of insurgent groups that lend their expertise to one another as well as the difficulties the Afghan government has had in rallying its own people to fight them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Karzai has compounded the problem, some Afghan analysts say, by insisting that the Taliban are not to blame for the violence and that they are ''upset brothers'' rather than mortal enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying the latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are the region's geopolitics. Both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Iran are known to be supporting the Taliban and play out their antagonism to the United States on Afghan soil. ''You have to see these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the broader strategic context,'' said Haseeb Humayoon, the director of a risk consulting firm here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A period of relative calm last year in Afghan cities coincided with an easing of tensions between the Afghans and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over negotiations with the Taliban. Now the Afghans appear to be trying to negotiate with the Taliban on their own, and there is talk of permanent American bases here, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Iran see as a potential loss of their influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our neighbors interpret that as Afghans' seeking guarantors of security other than them,'' Mr. Humayoon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Both the international military and our own government are distracted,'' he added. ''Our government is not focusing enough on rallying people against these forces, and the international military coalition has not focused enough on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American commanders play down the significance of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in terms of the overall fight in Afghanistan, but Afghan security officials say they see a troubling and potentially crippling development. ''It's not that the American surge operations will be affected by this directly,'' said a former Afghan security official. Rather, he predicted that the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could preoccupy Afghan security leaders, diminishing their ability to contribute to the fight in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans had not expected the suicide bombings on this scale but were bracing for assassination attempts this spring against officials, said Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, NATO's chief of strategic communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban in the past have been careful not to single out civilians, although civilians are often killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least some Taliban factions seem worried about the latest tactics. Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman for the north and east of the country, said an investigation was under way into the Jalalabad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which killed 40 people, nearly half of them civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are taking this issue seriously as we have appointed a delegate to assess the civilians casualties,'' he said. ''We are not happy when there is even one civilian lost.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such statements, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on civilians are clearly on the rise and the sophistication of the suicide bombings has been striking, Admiral Smith said. American and Afghan officials now believe that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group that planned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India, in 2008, has been working with the Haqqani network, which is based in North Waziristan. Lashkar-e-Taiba specializes in planning complex suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The suicide bombings are, we believe, predominantly requested and funded by Haqqani but facilitated by LET and AQ,'' said a senior American military official, referring to Lashkar-e-Taiba and Al Qaeda. ''The latter groups provide bombers and material in exchange for money. Haqqani chooses targets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombing of the Kabul Bank branch in Jalalabad used a formula Lashkar-e-Taiba has used elsewhere: multiple attackers, a first bomber to clear the way for the others and the holding of one bomber in reserve to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the police and medical workers who arrive to help. Other signatures included having a suicide bomber on a cellphone with a handler, as was the case in the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What cannot be ignored, however, is the situation across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. While American troops have made clear gains in uprooting the Taliban from Kandahar and large areas of Helmand Province, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not made similar strides in ousting the Taliban from the tribal areas, according to analysts here. The Haqqani network, among the most brutal, remains anchored in North Waziristan despite a stream of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Central Intelligence Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in bad news for Afghanistan, a little-noticed peace deal took place late last year between the Haqqani network and Shiite tribes in the Kurram Agency in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which opened up a new route for Haqqani agents to enter Afghanistan, American and Afghan intelligence officials said. A number of fighters have been observed crossing the border over the past several weeks, American intelligence officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one yet seems to have figured out how to deal with the two largest underlying problems: the poor performance of the Afghan government, which makes many of the country's citizens reluctant to fight for it, and the millions of Pashtuns in the tribal areas who feel they are unrepresented and even discriminated against and are willing to cross the border to fight in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You still have two major factors,'' General Keane said, ''the ineffectiveness of the central government and the Pakistani sanctuaries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is strikingly reminiscent of Iraq in 2005, when that country's cities were gripped by violence, the government was unable to keep the people safe and fighters flowed in from other countries. It took four years to stem that violence, and an influx of troops like the one that Americans have now carried out in Afghanistan. The rash of recent bombings risks undermining the psychological advantage that had come with increased American troop strength in southern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- Abdul Khaliq Farahi's kidnappers attacked fast, smashing into his car to stall it, seizing him and executing his driver as he tried to make a phone call. Within seconds, they were driving away to a hide-out just 20 minutes away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Sept. 23, 2008, and Mr. Farahi, the Afghan consul general in the Pakistani border town of Peshawar, was driving home from work. His kidnapping was one of a series singling out foreign officials that included the taking of an Iranian diplomat and an attempt to kidnap the American consul, Lynne Tracey, who escaped thanks to the quick reactions of her driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Farahi, 52, spent two years and two months as a captive of Arab members of Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas. Questioned under torture for the first six months, he was moved 17 times. Apart from the first days when local Pakistani and Afghan militants handled him, he was always held by Arabs, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke for the first time at length about his two-year ordeal in an interview in a hotel in downtown Kabul, just yards from the presidential palace where he has been living as a guest of President Hamid Karzai since his release last November. Within days of being snatched, Mr. Farahi was driven deep into the mountains of South Waziristan, one of the most inaccessible of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal territories, where Islamist militants run a virtual ministate beyond the control of the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found himself in a remote valley. Inside one of a few small huts, an Arab man was waiting for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' 'Whatever you need, we are ready to bring you,' '' Mr. Farahi recalled the Arab's saying. '' 'We will start the questions tomorrow.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I understood this is the center of Al Qaeda,'' he said. His interrogator was in his 20s, gave his name as Hassan and spoke English with a British accent, he said. ''When I saw them, I realized they were Al Qaeda. I thought they would kill me, that first they would ask me questions and then they would kill me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2008, Pakistani and Qaeda militants were spreading their reach beyond their base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mountainous tribal areas into the heart of the country's main cities, and exposing the perilous weakness of the Pakistani state as they conducted assassinations, suicide bombings and kidnappings. Mr. Farahi said that seeing Al Qaeda up close brought home to him how powerful they were in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''They could do whatever they wanted,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani militants had long been carrying out kidnappings to extort money and sometimes to exchange for prisoners being held by the government. They had gained the release of a number of high-level prisoners in exchange for the Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan, Tariq Azizuddin, just months earlier. Al Qaeda, Mr. Farahi said he came to realize, was engaging in kidnapping for the same reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At the beginning, I could not understand why they took me,'' he said, recalling his ordeal in sometimes imperfect English. ''They would say: 'You are a representative of America. Your government is not a Muslim government. We have the right to kill you. You are not Muslim.' '' They also accused him of working with the Central Intelligence Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Then later I realized they had aims to release their friends and get some money,'' he said. ''I concluded they organized the kidnapping.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which he sensed was large and had multiple sections, was led by an Arab in his 40s who had fought in Afghanistan against the Soviet occupation. The man gave different names; one was Abdul Haq, but it was not his real name, Mr. Farahi said. Mr. Farahi met him 12 to 15 times, until he was killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was another man in charge of security, an Arab from Saudi Arabia, about 30, who gave numerous names -- Ali, Muhammad, Mustafa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For the first six months, they gave me a lot of torture and a lot of questions,'' he said. ''After that, they treated me better.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was blindfolded and handcuffed, his feet manacled and chained to his hands, or was made to stand for 12 or 13 hours in a locked room. Then he would be questioned for an hour or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was allowed to go to the bathroom only after 24 or 30 hours. Sometimes he was suspended painfully for three or four minutes at a time by his arms. During one period, he was kept down a well, in a space dug out from the side of the wall, for four or five days at a time. The room down the well, he later came to understand, was designed for people to hide from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other air activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arabs had very specific questions about intelligence subjects, American diplomats and civilian contractors, and Afghan government and tribal relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They asked me hundreds of questions,'' he recalled. '' 'Where is the Blackwater center? Where is the center of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?' They asked me for details of the American Embassy in Islamabad. They asked too many questions, the location of the Afghan government intelligence. I did not know the locations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Arabs seemed to live and operate on their own, Mr. Farahi learned that there was a close cooperation between them and the Pakistani militant groups. At one point, he was moved to a Pakistani village in another valley, indicating a level of interaction or cooperation with local Pakistanis, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time two Pakistani Taliban, Pashto speakers, were among his guards, he said. ''The Pakistanis know very well the Arabs are there, because this group of Al Qaeda was mixed with the Pakistani Taliban,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After six months he was moved to a big room where another prisoner was behind a curtain. ''At the beginning, I thought he was an Afghan businessman from Herat,'' he said. ''But then I realized he was an Iranian diplomat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fellow prisoner was Heshmatollah Attarzadeh, the Iranian consul in Peshawar who was kidnapped two months after Mr. Farahi in November 2008. They were held on and off together for the next year until Mr. Attarzadeh was released, after some delays, in March of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time they were not allowed to talk to each other, but they found one place where they could, softly, so as not to attract attention. Mr. Attarzadeh had come to the same conclusion -- that Al Qaeda had kidnapped him in order to win the release of prisoners and extort money from his government, Mr. Farahi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials have said Iran's government made direct contact with Al Qaeda and negotiated Mr. Attarzadeh's release. One Pakistani official said the Iranian government exchanged him for antiaircraft missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security official said the diplomat was exchanged for high-level Qaeda operatives, including Saiful Adil, an important figure who was the organization's commander for external operations and had been in Iranian custody since 2001, as well as some families of Qaeda members. A daughter and a son of Osama bin Laden were allowed to leave Iran at that time, and Pakistani officials said their release from house arrest was part of the deal to gain Mr. Attarzadeh's freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release of the Iranian gave Mr. Farahi hope. Six months later, he was released and deposited at the border near Khost in eastern Afghanistan. He says he does not know if any deal was made on his behalf, but officials in Afghanistan suggest that he was exchanged for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Farahi remains reticent about some things. ''I was two years and two months with Al Qaeda in different places, and I realized so many things,'' he said. ''I learned too many things about that issue and about the terrorists. I will write a book about it.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANY American Muslims are fearful and angry about the Congressional hearings on Islamic radicalism that will start Thursday, with some arguing that they are a mere provocation meant to incite bigotry. But as a scholar, I view the hearings, to be led by Representative Peter T. King, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, as an opportunity to educate Americans about our community's diversity and faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic is urgent, and the hearings overdue. It is undeniable that the phenomenon of homegrown terrorists appears to be increasing in frequency. A successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would set back relations between Muslims and non-Muslims for many years. The backlash would effectively sweep away the slow but steady progress in interfaith dialogue that has been achieved since 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim leaders must acknowledge that many Americans are fearful of religiously motivated terrorism. Simply to protest the hearings and call for them to be canceled, as some have done, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many non-Muslims as uncooperative, or as intended to conceal dark secrets or un-American behavior.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Muslims should embrace the chance to explain their beliefs fully and clearly. We have nothing to hide. But members of Congress also need to act responsibly. They should avoid broad accusations, and be aware that the hearings will be closely followed worldwide. The actions of both groups will shape America's relationship with Islam, and the relationship of American Muslims with their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To better understand the Muslim community and its attitudes toward American identity, I spent much of 2008 and 2009 traveling the United States. My research assistants and I visited 75 communities, from Dearborn, Mich., to Arab, Ala., and 100 mosques around the country. We conducted hundreds of interviews, and compiled some 2,000 responses to a long questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We discovered that well before the debate last year over a proposed Islamic center in Lower Manhattan, American Muslims felt under siege. We heard heartbreaking stories: schoolchildren assaulted as ''terrorists,'' women wearing the hijab attacked, and mosques vandalized and firebombed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to their sense of being unfairly singled out were commentators in the news media talking as if it were open season on Muslims. Bill O'Reilly compared the Koran to Hitler's ''Mein Kampf,'' and Tom Tancredo, a Republican who was then a congressman from Colorado, said the United States could respond to a future terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by bombing Mecca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I also saw much to encourage me during my travels. Muslims told me in the privacy of their homes that this country was ''the best place in the world to be Muslim.'' A Nigerian in Houston said he placed Thomas Jefferson ''at the top of my heart.'' The bearded leader of a major Muslim organization called Jefferson, a defender of religious freedom, a role model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paterson, N.J., an elderly woman from Cairo who got an education in America after her Egyptian husband deserted her told us, ''America saved my life.'' In the only mosque in the small city of Gadsden, Ala., we met a Muslim man who had lived in the area for decades and married a Christian woman. In a distinctively Southern accent, he summed up his identity as ''Muslim by birth, Southern by the grace of God.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim community in America is not a monolith. Very broadly, it comprises three groups: African-Americans (many of them converts), immigrants (largely from the Middle East and South Asia) and white converts. And Muslims from every part of the world study and work in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the diversity of the Muslim community is frequently obscured by ignorance and mistrust. We were often asked by non-Muslims whether Muslims could be ''good'' Americans. The frequency with which this question was asked indicated the doubts that many harbored. Too many Americans acknowledged that they knew virtually nothing about Islam and said they had never met a Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative King, the New York Republican who has called the hearings, has raised the issue of Muslim cooperation with law enforcement agencies. On our journey, especially in mosques, we confronted an underlying unease and suspicion toward these agencies. Frequently, even while we were being welcomed and honored, people would ask us with a nervous laugh whether we were working for the F.B.I. The community complained that crude attempts by the agencies to ''study'' them were both insulting and ineffective. They believed that thinly disguised informants who claimed to be converting to Islam were acting as provocateurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Texas mosque dominated by the Salafi school of thought -- widely equated with religious fundamentalism -- the congregants condemned terrorism. They complained that the agencies had used clumsy infiltrators instead of simply talking to congregants. ''Homeland Security and F.B.I. put us under surveillance, asking people, 'Where are the terrorists?''' one interviewee, a Salafi who professed nonviolence, told us. ''We know exactly where they are!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, we did see evidence of the kind of extremist beliefs the hearing is intended to scrutinize. In one of the first mosques we visited in the Midwest, after I gave a talk advocating interfaith dialogue, I was accosted by members of the congregation who vehemently disagreed and dismissed my fieldwork because I had ''white kids'' with me. Later we learned that these men had threatened and assaulted other congregants who did not agree with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our review of cases involving radicalized American Muslims, we learned that many homegrown terrorists said their actions were grounded in American foreign policy, particularly when it resulted in the deaths of women and children, rather than in their interpretations of Koranic precepts. In public statements, they expressed anger about American military and intelligence intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and other Muslim countries. For example, Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani immigrant who confessed to the attempted car bombing in Times Square last May, was motivated by a desire to avenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his native province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a civil, respectful level of discussion and debate is not maintained in these hearings, and if a demonization of Muslims results, the news coverage in the Muslim world could feed into the high levels of anti-Americanism in countries like Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would play against the interests of American diplomats and troops in Muslim nations who have advocated the winning of Muslim hearts and minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To better inform the public debate, Representative King should invite religious and social leaders who have credibility in their communities. Equally important, he should include scholars who could present empirical findings and analysis with neutrality and integrity. Unfortunately, some of the names who have been associated with the hearings so far have neither research nor credibility to support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Muslims must realize that to be truly accepted as ''good'' Americans, they need to more explicitly embrace American identity, culture and history -- from political debates like Representative King's hearing to the ideals of this country's founders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America, in turn, must realize its best aspirations by better understanding Islam. No appreciation of the founders is complete without an acknowledgment of their truly pluralist vision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In an unusual briefing, a top Pakistani general leading troops in the volatile North Waziristan region has acknowledged the effectiveness of the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against foreign militants, according to reports in the local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, operated by the C.I.A., are immensely controversial in the country and are often attributed as one of the major reasons of a surge in anti-American sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, the Pakistani government and the powerful military condemn the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though privately they acknowledge their utility. It is rare for civilian or military officials to give any nod to the effectiveness of the campaign, and the controversy surrounding the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a staple of the national debate. Opposition political parties and Islamists call the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a violation of the country's sovereignty and question their legality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawn, considered the country's leading English-language daily, quoted Maj. Gen. Mehmood Ghayur of the army's Seventh division in North Waziristan, as saying that ''myths and rumors about U.S. Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the casualty figures are many, but it's a reality that many of those being killed in these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are hardcore elements, a sizable number of them foreigners.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general was briefing a group of local Peshawar-based journalists on a rare trip to Miram Shah, the main city in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to details listed in the general's briefing and quoted by Dawn, militants of several nationalities have been singled out in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diverse nationalities of the militants show the extent to which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal regions straddling the border with Afghanistan have been infiltrated by foreign fighters, mostly affiliated with Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawn quoted the commander as saying that between 2007 and 2011, about 164 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been carried out, killing more than 964 militants. Of those killed, 793 were local residents and 171 were foreigners, including Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Chechens, Filipinos and Moroccans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was the deadliest for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region, with 103 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing 423 militants, including 133 foreigners, the commander was quoted as saying. In 2008, 23 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 152 militants, 12 of them foreigners or affiliated with Al Qaeda. And in 2009, about 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 179 militants, including 20 foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the spokesman for the Pakistani Army, played down the remarks of General Ghayur in an interview on Wednesday evening, calling them a ''personal assessment'' that was reported without proper context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Abbas emphasized that the army supported the public policy of the government that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside Pakistani territory ''do more harm than good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The collateral damage by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> creates a huge impact within the country,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cyril Almeida, a columnist at Dawn, saw the briefing as a ''positive move.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Given the context, and recent history of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it is really unusual that they have gone public,'' Mr. Almeida said. ''Who knows what lies behind it, but it is definitely a good thing. A lot of the people have pointed that there have been lesser protests in the tribal areas over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as compared to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proper. The issue has become a bit of a political football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Anything that brings more clarity on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in terms of a frank assessment, as opposed to spin, makes sense,'' Mr. Almeida said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Inside a dark jail cell on the outskirts of Lahore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a brawny 36-year-old American from the mountains of southwest Virginia has sat for weeks as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began proceedings against him on murder charges and his own government made frantic attempts to secure his release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in January, Raymond A. Davis -- a covert security officer for the Central Intelligence Agency and onetime Green Beret -- unloaded a Glock pistol into two armed Pakistanis on a crowded street in Lahore, according to a Pakistani police report. His case was to move forward in court as early as this week.The shooting complicated American attempts to portray Mr. Davis as a paper-shuffling diplomat who stamped visas as a day job; generated an extraordinary swirl of recriminations and for many Pakistanis confirmed suspicions that America has deployed a secret army of spies and contractors inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also called unwelcome attention to a bigger, more dangerous game in which Mr. Davis appears to have played just a supporting role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. team Mr. Davis worked with, according to American officials, had among its assignments the task of secretly gathering intelligence about Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant ''Army of the Pure.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security establishment has nurtured Lashkar for years as a proxy force to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets and enemies in India and in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. These and other American officials, all of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity, are now convinced that Lashkar is no longer satisfied being the shadowy foot soldiers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> simmering border conflict with India. It goals have broadened, these officials say, and Lashkar is committed to a campaign of jihad against the United States and Europe, and against American troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to Islamabad last July, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declared Lashkar a ''global threat,'' a statement that no doubt rankled his Pakistani hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so a group that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has seen for years as an essential component of its own national security, and that American counterterrorism officials could once dismiss as a regional problem, has emerged as a threat that Washington feels it can no longer ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given such a fundamental collision of interests, it was perhaps inevitable that Lashkar would one day provoke tensions between Pakistani and American security officials, and the collision itself would come into full public view. Rather than being a cause of the problem, Mr. Davis was merely an all-too-visible symptom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Davis discovered, the regularly accepted rules of the spy game don't apply here. There was little chance of quickly brokering a quiet deal, allowing Mr. Davis to be spirited out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without anyone making a fuss. Because Lashkar has long been nurtured by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, American espionage operations against the group are freighted with grave risks, and are not viewed kindly by Pakistani spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Christine Fair, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expert and Georgetown University professor who closely studies Lashkar's operations, said that the group was founded by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government in the 1980s to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, a war that that ISI fought in close alliance with the C.I.A. As that war wound down, Professor Fair said, then President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began redeploying Lashkar fighters to Kashmir because he feared that Kashmiri independence groups might create a separate state in the mountainous region now controlled by India, rather than weld it to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The ISI continued to nurture Lashkar, along with others, as a counterweight to the separatist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially, Lashkar was banned by President Pervez Musharraf's government in 2002, and declared a terrorist organization three years later by the United Nations. But it hardly operates like a group in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, Lashkar's charismatic leader, gives regular sermons in Lahore on Fridays, denouncing what he calls the imperialism of the United States, Israel and India while flanked by guards. A stocky man with a wild beard, Mr. Saeed has been placed under house arrest at various times in the past 10 years, but in 2009 the Lahore High Court quashed all charges against him and set him free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same court has now been assigned to determine Mr. Davis's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashkar's sprawling headquarters in Muridke, a Lahore suburb situated along the famed Grand Trunk Road, contains not only a radical madrassa and housing for the school's faculty members, but also a market, a hospital and a fish farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorism experts said that the compound was built with donations from benefactors in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Arab world. Lashkar also runs successful fund-raising campaigns inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through its allied political organization, Jamat-ud-Dawah, a group that also operates schools, medical clinics and blood banks throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashkar has long employed the language of global jihad in its propaganda, denouncing the United States and Israel, and vowing that the group would ''plant a flag'' in Washington and Tel Aviv.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such global goals, Lashkar for most of its history has limited its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to India and Kashmir -- the targets that would serve the interests of its ISI benefactors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Fair, the Georgetown expert on Lashkar, said the group has set up sophisticated networks throughout Asia to train dozens of sleeper operatives for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Thailand, for instance, Muslim recruits arriving from India are handed fake Pakistani passports for travel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where they go for several weeks of training, according to Professor Fair. After the training, the operatives go back to Thailand, reclaim their Indian passports and return to India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experts on Lashkar say that in recent years the group has expanded the focus of its operations, perhaps because it has felt restricted by the ISI, or perhaps a sign that it was splitting into factions with competing agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reason, American intelligence officials believe that hundreds of Lashkar operatives now operate inside Afghanistan, and have teamed with other militant groups to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American troops. In February 2010, a Lashkar assault on a cluster of guesthouses in Kabul killed 18 people, including a number of Indian doctors and other foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashkar has also bolstered fund-raising networks throughout Europe, especially in Germany and Britain, and European counterterrorism officials believe Lashkar is considering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Western capitals similar to the devastating raids by the group in Mumbai, India, in November 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth G. Jones, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation who until last month worked on Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> issues for United States Special Operations Command, compared the expansion of Lashkar's operations with the broadening ambitions of the Pakistani Taliban, a group that had focused exclusively on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until it dispatched Faisal Shazad in a failed mission last May to set off a van full of explosives in Times Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jones said a Lashkar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the West could have more far-reaching consequences than one by the Taliban because Washington would no doubt lay blame for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the ISI's doorstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a recognition that because of Lashkar's associations, an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States could wind up causing the Pakistani government extreme pain,'' said Mr. Jones, implying the possibility of using military force deep within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, the ISI has quietly assented to the C.I.A.'s campaign to batter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes, because the strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have largely focused on operatives from Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban -- groups that Islamabad also considers to be mortal enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an American intelligence review late last year found that it was becoming harder to compartmentalize the distinct militant groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, because their membership and operations were blending into a murky stew; that was making it increasingly difficult to determine whether Pakistani support for groups like Lashkar might also be aiding Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Obama administration's signals that it would like to get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible have led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence officers to believe they should keep groups like Lashkar and the Haqqani network under their wing for future operations in Afghanistan and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, there seems to be little enthusiasm for sending yet another delegation to Islamabad to press Pakistani officials to cut their ties to militants. It hasn't worked so far, and Obama administration officials know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believes too much is at stake to walk away from the groups it might need once the Americans leave Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even with such seemingly irreconcilable differences, and even as both American and Pakistani officials muse in private about how long the beleaguered alliance can survive, both appear to realize that -- for now -- it simply must.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as senior Pakistani officials resent the billions of dollars in aid they accept from Washington, they believe that they can't turn away the money and hope to keep pace with their rival, India. And Wendy Chamberlin, the former American ambassador in Islamabad, said that America's relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remains essential for security in the region, even if some lawmakers in Washington might see cutting aid to the country as a way to distance the United States from the headaches of the relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many reasons for continuing the relationship with such a large and strategically important country, she said.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first public assessment since taking over the Afghan war effort last year, Gen. David Petraeus was cautiously upbeat. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that Taliban momentum has been ''arrested in much of the country and reversed in a number of important areas.'' He acknowledged that the progress is ''fragile and reversible.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We respect the general, and we hope his caveated optimism is warranted. But we need to hear more from him and from President Obama about their strategy for holding cleared areas of Afghanistan and their plans for building up a minimally competent and credible Afghan government so American troops can go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all of the other crises, there hasn't been a lot of talk about the Afghan war. Mr. Obama and his general should not misread that as acquiescence. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that two-thirds of Americans say the war is no longer worth fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is ever going to be success in Afghanistan -- that means a country that can govern itself and not provide a haven for Al Qaeda -- this is the best chance. The United States and its allies have 150,000 troops and more than 1,000 civilians on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Petraeus pointed to some promising gains: The Taliban has been cleared from long-held areas in Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and missions on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border have killed or captured hundreds more Taliban and Al Qaeda operatives. According to The Times, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan is expected to announce next week the transfer of six areas from allied to Afghan control. That should give a sense of whether the American strategy is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges are daunting, starting with Mr. Karzai's weak and cynical leadership and the corruption of his government. His attempt to block the seating of a new, more independent Parliament fed fears among his own citizens about his autocratic ambitions. He only backed off after strong pressure from the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sheltering of both Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders is also profoundly worrying. General Petraeus insisted that Pakistanis increasingly understand the threat, but he needs to tell them that time is running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, American officials appear serious about the idea of political negotiations with the Taliban. We don't know if there is a deal to be had. But the best chance of peeling off fighters, or changing the minds of some leaders, is right now while the United States and NATO have a military advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still believe that the United States has a strong strategic interest in Afghanistan. We also know that Americans' patience with this war has all but run out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Several missiles fired from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft on Thursday struck a meeting of local people in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had gathered with Taliban mediators to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a Pakistani intelligence official said, killed 26 of 32 people present, some of them Taliban fighters, but the majority elders and local people not attached to the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civilian death toll appeared to be among the worst in the scores of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out recently in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas by the C.I.A., which runs the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Local residents and media reports said as many as 40 people had been killed in all, though the intelligence official disputed that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued an unusual and unusually strong condemnation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''It is highly regrettable that a jirga of peaceful citizens, including elders of the area, was carelessly and callously targeted with complete disregard to human life,'' the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But American officials on Thursday sharply disputed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> account of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the civilian deaths, contending that all the people killed were insurgents. ''These people weren't gathering for a bake sale,'' an American official said. ''They were terrorists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About four missiles fired from one or more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit the meeting, known as a jirga, of two tribes and Taliban mediators who had gathered on open ground at a market in Datta Khel, in North Waziristan, according to two residents who live nearby in Miram Shah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence official said that of the 32 people at the meeting, 13 were Taliban fighters, 11 of whom were killed. The rest of the dead were elders and tribesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Taliban will never gather in such a large number in broad daylight to be targeted by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' according to a resident who did not want to be identified for fear of running afoul of the militants. ''It has been a big mistake to target the jirga, as it will have severe consequences.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently discovered chromite mines are common in the area. To keep the mines running profitably, the Taliban -- as the reigning authorities in the area -- often settle disputes between tribes with competing claims and levy taxes on exports and the mine operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday were the second such barrage in two days in Datta Khel, and the sixth in the tribal areas in the past week, according to The Long War Journal, a Web site that monitors the wars in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a pause in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Jan. 23 to Feb. 20, the pace of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has picked up again this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts attributed the lull to the C.I.A.'s not wanting to upset negotiations to free Raymond A. Davis, the C.I.A. security officer who was released on Wednesday. But American intelligence officials denied that and attributed the pause in part to poor weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region is under the sway of a local warlord and Taliban commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who made a truce with the government as the Pakistani military pushed into South Waziristan in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Bahadur has accepted many Taliban fighters who fled the campaign into his area, and he continues to have close ties to the Haqqani network, a militant group allied with the government and the Taliban that uses North Waziristan as its main base to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are immensely unpopular in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and have been a rallying point for anti-American sentiment, though in recent years they have provoked less outrage in the tribal areas, as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have focused increasingly on foreign fighters loyal to Al Qaeda who have infiltrated the area, and as fewer civilians have been killed by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday, however, threatened to turn opinion in the region against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One resident said that given the large Taliban presence, average people and the militants were difficult to distinguish in the area, but that to target a jirga would lead to a backlash. ''It will create resentment among the locals,'' he said, ''and everyone might turn into suicide bombers.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a chilly night in the dead of a New England winter, Yasir Qadhi hurried down the stairs of Yale University's religious-studies department, searching urgently for a place to make a private call. A Ph.D. candidate in Islamic studies, Qadhi was a fixture on the New Haven campus. He wore a trim beard and preppy polo shirts, blending in with the other graduate students as he lugged an overstuffed backpack into Blue State Coffee for his daily cappuccino. A popular teaching assistant, he exuded a sprightly intensity in class, addressing the undergraduates as ''dudes.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Qadhi had another life. Beyond the gothic confines of Yale, he was becoming one of the most influential conservative clerics in American Islam, drawing a tide of followers in the fundamentalist movement known as Salafiya. Raised between Texas and Saudi Arabia, he seemed uniquely deft at balancing the edicts of orthodox Islam with the mores of contemporary America. To many young Muslims wrestling with conflicts between faith and country, Qadhi was a rock star. To law-enforcement agents, he was also a figure of interest, given his prominence in a community considered vulnerable to radicalization. Some officials, noting his message of nonviolence, saw him as an ally. Others were wary, recalling a time when Qadhi spouted a much harder, less tolerant line. On this night, however, it was Qadhi's closest followers who were questioning him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks earlier, on Christmas Day 2009, a young Nigerian tried to blow up a jet headed for Detroit with a bomb sewn into his underwear. The suspect had been a student of Qadhi's at the AlMaghrib Institute, which teaches Salafi theology in 21 American cities. F.B.I. agents were demanding interviews with Qadhi's students. He urged them to cooperate, but many pushed back, and Qadhi found himself caught between two seemingly irreconcilable forces: a deeply suspicious government and a young following he could lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the basement of the religious-studies building, Qadhi settled into an empty room, flipped open his MacBook Pro (encased in Islamic apple green) and dialed in to an Internet conference call with more than 150 of his AlMaghrib students. ''I want to be very frank here,'' Qadhi said, his voice tight with exasperation. ''Do you really, really think that blowing up a plane is Islamic? I mean, ask yourself this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the students defended the plot, but some sympathized with the suspect, said several students who participated in the call, one of whom provided a recording to The Times. Was it not possible, they asked, that he had been set up? And how could they trust the F.B.I. after all they experienced -- the post-9/11 raids, the monitoring of mosques, the sting operations aimed at Muslims? A few went as far as to say that they could not turn against a fellow Muslim who was trying to fight the oppressive policies of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi paced the worn, gray carpet. ''There were even Muslims on that plane!'' he said. ''I mean, what world are you living in? How angry and overzealous are you that you simply forget about everything and you think that this is the way forward?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next year, Qadhi was thrust into the center of a crucial struggle -- for the minds of his young students, the trust of his government and his own future as America was waking to a new threat. Since 2008, more than two dozen Muslim-Americans have joined or sought training with militant groups abroad. They are among the roughly 50 American citizens charged with terrorism-related offenses during that time. These suspects are a mixed lot. Some converted to Islam; others were raised in the faith. They come from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds and have migrated to different fronts in their global war, from Somalia to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their motivations differ, but the vast majority share two key attributes: a deep disdain for American foreign policy and an ideology rooted in Salafiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spectrum of the global Salafi movement, Qadhi, who is 36, speaks for the nonmilitant majority. Yet even as he has denounced Islamist violence -- too late, some say -- a handful of AlMaghrib's former students have heeded the call. In addition to the underwear-bomb suspect, the 36,000 current and former students of Qadhi's institute include Daniel Maldonado, a New Hampshire convert who was convicted in 2007 of training with an Al Qaeda-linked militia in Somalia; Tarek Mehanna, a 28-year-old pharmacist arrested for conspiring to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans; and two young Virginia men held in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2009 for seeking to train with militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi said that none of those former students had approached him for counsel. But in recent years, countless others have come to him with questions about the legitimacy of waging jihad. ''We're finding ourselves on the front line,'' Qadhi said. ''We don't want to be there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the months I spent in the insular world of young American Salafis, it became clear how pressing those questions are for many conservative Muslims who have come of age after 9/11. They have watched as their own country wages war in Muslim lands, bearing witness -- via satellite television and the Internet -- to the carnage in Iraq, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo. While the dozens of AlMaghrib students I interviewed condemned the tactics of militant groups, many share their basic grievances. They are searching for the correct Islamic response, turning to the ancient texts that guide their American lives. Their salvation, they say, hangs in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what makes Qadhi such a pivotal figure in a subculture that is little understood, even by the law-enforcement officials who monitor it. He is the rare Western cleric fluent in the language of militants, having spent nearly a decade studying Islam in Saudi Arabia, steeped in the same tradition that spawned Osama bin Laden's splinter movement. Arguably few American theologians are better positioned to offer an authoritative rebuttal of extremist ideology. But to do that, Qadhi says he would need to address the thorny question of what kinds of militant actions are permitted by Islamic law. It is a forbidden topic for most American clerics, who even refrain from criticizing their country's foreign policy for fear of being branded unpatriotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For an ultraconservative cleric like Qadhi, the picture is more complicated. Engaging in a detailed discussion of militant jihad -- a complex subject informed by centuries of scholarship -- risks drawing the scrutiny of law enforcement and, Qadhi fears, possible prosecution. If he were to acknowledge that Islamic law endorses the legitimacy of armed resistance against Western forces in Muslim territory, he could give a green light to the very students he claims he is trying to keep off the militant path. Yet by remaining silent, Qadhi says he is losing the credibility he needs to persuade them of his ultimate message: those fights are not theirs, as Westerners, to fight. ''My hands are tied, and my tongue is silent,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militant clerics abroad have filled the void, none more than Anwar al-Awlaki, the American preacher who is now believed to be in hiding in Yemen with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Awlaki has been linked to numerous plots against the United States, including the botched underwear bombing. He has taken to the Internet with stirring battle cries directed at young American Muslims. ''Many of your scholars,'' Awlaki warned last year, are ''standing between you and your duty of jihad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was near midnight last October when Qadhi's teenage acolytes surrounded him at Thomas Sweet, an ice cream parlor in New Brunswick, N.J. Puma sneakers peeked out from under long robes. Suddenly the lyrics ''shake your booty'' blasted over the speakers. The young men leaned in closer, unfazed. Between helpings of mango-flavored sorbet, Qadhi pontificated on medieval Islamic theology. ''We have a reasonable religion,'' he said. ''We're a very logical, rational group of people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi's students hang on his every word. They huddle around him -- between classes, during meals, even in bathrooms -- pinging him with questions. Their reliance on Qadhi is a product of contemporary Islam, a decentralized religion with no clear authority. Clerics with the highest level of scholarship are considered invaluable guides, especially in the secular West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi was in New Jersey that weekend to teach a seminar on the concept of faith-led action. During a break, a dozen young men flocked to him once again. A soft-spoken engineer lobbed the first question: Wasn't it hypocritical for the same Western imams who supported the Afghan resistance against the Soviets to now condemn the jihad against American troops? After all, another student asked, don't civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan ''have an obligation to do something to defend themselves?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am not commenting on what they should or should not do,'' Qadhi replied. ''I am commenting on what you should do as American Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had heard it before: vote, educate your neighbors, protest peacefully. But is that what Islam commands when your people are dying? The question haunts some of Qadhi's brightest students. One of the deepest Islamic principles is that of the ummah -- the global community that unites all Muslims. The Prophet Muhammad was said to have likened it to the human body. If one part hurts, the whole body aches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Qadhi's followers, a feisty 27-year-old New Yorker, compared his experience of watching bombs fall on Iraq to what other Americans might feel at seeing ''California being ravaged day in and day out. How would you feel?'' He said he understood why Qadhi could not speak expansively about the conflicts overseas. Even so, he asked, who has greater credibility: the cleric living comfortably in America or the militant ''in the cave'' who sacrificed everything for his beliefs? ''One thing about Awlaki no one can deny,'' he said, ''this man is fearless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Awlaki carries weight with conservative Muslims underscores both the rivalry and proximity between militant and nonmilitant Salafis. Qadhi and Awlaki have parallel pasts: they were both born in the United States, spent part of their youth in the Middle East and entered the American Salafi movement just as it was on the rise. Awlaki later spent time in a Yemeni prison and emerged in 2008 calling for Muslims to fight the West. Recordings of his sermons continued to be sold at AlMaghrib seminars even after the students were ordered to stop in November 2009, following the Fort Hood shootings that Awlaki praised. Many of the students had grown up listening to him preach on his CDs. They trusted him then, one told me, why not trust him now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the tiny fraction of AlMaghrib's students who have turned to violence, many are what Qadhi refers to as ''sympathizers'' of militant anger. These young, politically attuned Muslims are taken with events that don't even register with most Americans, like two recent terrorism cases in New York that drew overflow crowds, Qadhi's students among them. ''If any Muslim is oppressed anywhere, the prevailing wisdom is that we should be standing up to help them -- if we're true believers,'' says Ify Okoye, an AlMaghrib volunteer from Beltsville, Md. Sometimes, she added, ''you feel guilty for living here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of today's young American Muslims are the children of educated, successful immigrants whose passage to the United States came smoothly, in contrast to Europe's largely working-class Muslims. For years, this bolstered the theory that American Muslim youth had been spared the alienation that fostered militancy in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But alienation has many faces. America's youngest Muslims have grown up in a newly hostile country, with mounting opposition to the construction of mosques, a national movement seeking to ban courts from consulting shariah, or Islamic law, and rising hate crimes against Muslims. While some young Muslims have sought distance, abandoning Islam and even changing their names, others have experienced a spiritual awakening. The most conservative have found a home in Salafiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salafis take their name from the Arabic word ''salaf,'' meaning ''ancestor.'' Their movement seeks to reclaim Islam's lost glory by purging the faith of modern influences. Salafis model their lives after the first Muslims, beginning with the Prophet Muhammad, the seventh-century Meccan merchant to whom the Koran, it is believed, was revealed. They encourage a direct relationship with God through a literal reading of Islam's primary sources -- the Koran and the Sunnah, the prophet's sayings and deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the faith, Salafis have a reputation for intolerance and divisiveness. Like other religious conservatives, they tend to be adamant in their strict interpretations, shunning those who disagree. They denounce the veneration of saints, common among some Sufi sects. Many Salafi men insist on a fist-length beard and wear their trousers above the ankle in a desire to emulate the prophet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While versions of Salafiya have persisted through history, its current iteration derives largely from the puritanical, 18th-century school of Saudi Islam known as Wahhabism. Today's Salafis share the same basic theology but differ on how to manifest it. Many are apolitical, while another subset engages in politics as a nonviolent means to an end -- namely, an Islamic theocracy. A third fringe group is devoted to militant jihad as the only path to Islamic rule and, ultimately, heaven. All three strains have surfaced in the West, where the movement has flourished among the children of immigrants. ''It's about this deep desire for certainty,'' Bernard Haykel, a leading Salafi expert at Princeton University, says. ''They are responding to a kind of disenchantment with the modern world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One balmy afternoon last spring, Qadhi walked across Yale's campus, stepping around a throng of teenagers he dismissed, irascibly, as ''the prefreshie tour.'' He stopped before the tomblike building that houses the elite Skull and Bones society. Qadhi stared up at the brownstone facade, as if imagining the secrets it held. ''You're set for life,'' he said, squinting through his sunglasses. ''You get to thinking that everyone in the White House was a part of this, and it's easy to see why people think there is a conspiracy.'' After a pause, he added, ''I don't believe those theories.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi is hardly disenchanted by the trappings of Western life. He has more than 10,000 fans on Facebook, hundreds of sermons on YouTube and a growing Twitter following. He drives a black, leather-interior Honda CR-V, often pulling into a Popeye's drive-through for popcorn shrimp and gravy-slathered biscuits. He is planning a trip to Disney World with his wife, Rumana, and their four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Qadhi's followers find his ease with American culture perplexing, even suspicious. Yet it is his unapologetic comfort with America -- his assertion that Muslims belong here as much as anyone -- that has also made him a point of pride for many young Salafis. ''We need to make sure that our children can live freely, and we're going to fight for that freedom,'' he told me one afternoon. ''And every time I use that word, I need to make a disclaimer -- I don't mean 'fight' in the Tea Party sense of overthrowing the government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stout five-foot-five, Qadhi chuckles easily and speaks rapidly, his hands punctuating his words with slicing motions. He is confident to a fault, often trailing a sentence with ''God protect me from arrogance.'' In class, he can be staid and professorial, with flashes of frivolity. He once implored students to ''make love, not jihad.'' He blends religious piety with entrepreneurial savvy. More than 20,000 people have signed up for ''Like a Garment,'' Qadhi's new online seminar about sex in Islamic marriage. ''I give explicit detail on how a man should give his wife an orgasm in a permissible manner,'' he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi's platform is the AlMaghrib Institute, where he serves as academic dean. Founded in 2002 by Muhammad Alshareef, a Canadian cleric then living in Alexandria, Va., AlMaghrib is now an international enterprise, offering seminars in the United States, Canada and Britain. It reported nearly $1.2 million in revenue in 2009 and aspires to become a full-time Islamic seminary, albeit with an air of corporate America. During a recent retreat in the mountains of Ontario, AlMaghrib's clerics whizzed along snowy bluffs on sleds drawn by Siberian huskies. ''As long as you don't touch them, it's all right,'' Qadhi said, referring to his interpretation of Islam's ruling on dogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last June, Qadhi and his family left New Haven for the outskirts of Memphis, settling into a spacious new ranch house in a well-tended subdivision. Still at work on his doctoral thesis, Qadhi found a job teaching Islamic studies at Rhodes College, which is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is something of a curiosity that Qadhi, who was raised in Saudi Arabia, Islam's birthplace, now lives in a landscape marked by church steeples and ''What would Jesus do?'' bumper stickers. But the American South seems to agree with Qadhi, who often preaches on the Islamic principle of polite conduct. He takes to the gentility of his students at Rhodes, who call him sir. There is no better place to be Muslim than in America, he says, because as a minority ''you feel your faith.'' At times, he seems oddly Pollyanna-ish about his future in Tennessee, where someone tried to torch the site of a planned mosque last year. Qadhi concedes that living someplace like Saudi Arabia might be easier, but ''it's not my land at the end of the day,'' he said. ''I am an American. What else can I say?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Qadhi's current incarnation, it is hard to make out the preacher he refers to as ''the old me.'' That Qadhi lives on via YouTube. In a television show recorded in Egypt in 2001, Qadhi, then 26, explains that one form of kufr, or disbelief, is adhering to man-made laws over God's law. ''Can you believe it?'' he says. ''A group of people coming together and voting -- and the majority vote will then be the law of the land. What gives you the right to prohibit something or allow something?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His young students nod their heads. ''Islam is a complete way of life, a complete submission to Allah and to the rulings of Allah,'' Qadhi said on the show. ''It is a complete package.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before Sala--ya came to the United States, Qadhi's father arrived in Houston from Karachi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was 1963, and the young bachelor, Mazhar Kazi, enrolled at the University of Houston with his sights on a medical degree. One of the first foreign-born Muslims to settle in the area, Kazi took a job as a busboy and tended to his studies. He eventually married a microbiologist from Karachi and founded the area's first mosque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their son, Yasir, was born in 1975, the second of two boys. When Yasir was 5, the Kazis moved to Jedda, Saudi Arabia, intent on exposing their sons to Islam and Arabic. Kazi took a job teaching medicine at the King Abdulaziz University. The family spent summers in Houston, but the boys were mostly shaped by life in Jedda, a blend of British expat culture and strict Saudi norms. Qadhi (who later changed the spelling of his surname to reflect the correct pronunciation) was precociously bookish. On weekends, he searched the local library for Tolstoy and Hemingway. By 15, Qadhi had memorized the Koran and graduated from high school, two years early, as valedictorian. Following his father's wishes, he enrolled at the University of Houston in 1991, majoring in chemical engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi had never attended a class with women and was shocked by campus life. He took refuge in the Muslim Students Association, a close-knit group of mostly Arab and South Asian immigrants. He was soon leading study circles and delivering effusive Friday sermons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His introduction to Salafiya came in his sophomore year, when a Muslim convert from Colorado visited campus. A tall, regal man with a wispy white beard, the preacher displayed a command of Islam that Qadhi had never seen. When asked a question, he closed his eyes and recited a litany of evidence from the Koran and the Sunnah. This approach, a cornerstone of Salafiya, appealed to Qadhi's empiricism. ''It's so disciplined and academic,'' he said. Then 17, Qadhi began driving through the night to attend Salafi camping retreats, where legendary clerics lectured from Jordan and Saudi Arabia via teleconference. He drilled into Salafiya with a discipline that defied his adolescence. At a retreat in Boulder, Colo., some of Qadhi's friends skipped out to go fishing. When they returned, Qadhi refused to share his notes. ''It was very clear that this guy was going to become something and we weren't,'' said one of the friends, Amad Shaikh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At another retreat, Qadhi fell under the sway of Ali al-Timimi. A cancer researcher from Maryland, Timimi had studied Islam in Saudi Arabia and helped spread the American Salafi movement, which began in the early 1980s as a patchwork of nonprofit groups subsidized by the Saudi government. Through shipments of free Korans and other texts, Salafi doctrine developed a strong presence at American mosques, prisons and Islamic schools. By the 1990s, the Salafi community numbered in the low thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Salafiya mirrored the movement abroad. It was largely apolitical until the first gulf war, when the United States set up a base in Saudi Arabia. The presence of American troops on Saudi soil, home to Islam's holiest sites, was a defining moment for Salafis, giving rise to a political awakening and fueling bin Laden's militancy. In America, some Salafi clerics began calling for political action against the Saudi regime, while others remained loyal. Qadhi was torn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on other matters, he steered his fellow students in Houston toward a strict code. They instituted sex segregation, policing each other for signs of deviation. When a Pakistani student organization sponsored a rock concert, Qadhi and his friends distributed fliers warning the crowds that Islam prohibited music. They did not see themselves as stakeholders in America, Shaikh recalled. Their goal was to spread Islam and then migrate to Muslim lands. ''It was almost cultish,'' Shaikh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all his stridency, Qadhi broke one significant rule: he fell in love outside the bounds of arranged marriage. The young woman, Rumana, was a quiet, graceful college student of Indian descent. But Qadhi's parents had their sights on other marriage candidates, and the courtship faded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During college, jihad loomed in the backdrop of Qadhi's life. Like many of his peers, he was taken by the legend of the American Muslims who had fought with the Afghan mujahedeen against the Soviets. Back then, talk of jihad carried little taboo, given the United States' role in financing the resistance. Qadhi knew several men who later fought in Bosnia. Noble as it seemed, he said, ''I thought there were more productive ways for me to spend my life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had long thought of becoming a Muslim scholar. Shortly before graduating, Qadhi applied to the Islamic University of Medina, a leading Salafi institution. After enrolling in the fall of 1996, he called Rumana. ''I can't live without you,'' he told her. ''Are you willing to live a difficult life?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi and his new wife settled into a spare apartment, and he plunged into round-the-clock study. Life in Medina deepened his faith while narrowing his tolerance for the outside world. He came to identify with political Salafiya, denouncing secular democracies and declaring Sufis and Shia ''heretics.'' He took up the Palestinian cause -- a pathway, he said, to the anti-Semitic rhetoric that ran rampant in his circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the summer of 2001, Qadhi traveled to London to teach at an Islamic conference. At the end of a class, he went into a diatribe arguing that Israel did not rightfully belong to the Jewish people. ''Hitler never intended to mass-destroy the Jews,'' Qadhi said, telling the audience to read a book about ''the hoax'' of the Holocaust. He went on to say that most Islamic-studies professors in the United States are Jews who ''want to destroy us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back, Qadhi said he fell down a slippery slope where criticism of Israel gave way to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Jews. Beneath the vitriol, he said, was a sense of victimization -- that non-Muslims were to blame for the afflictions of the Muslim world. ''When you're young and naive, it's easier to fall prey to such things,'' said Qadhi, who publicly recanted years later. Last August, he joined a delegation of American imams and rabbis on a visit to the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps, which he said left him ''sick'' and more embarrassed by his Hitler remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a pre-9/11 world,'' he said. ''The circumstances did not dictate that we think critically.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months after the London episode, Qadhi was walking to his mosque in Medina when a friend came running. ''Yasir, Yasir, did you hear what happened?'' the young man called out. Qadhi rushed to a neighbor's apartment in search of a television, just as the second tower collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of 9/11, the American Salafi movement fell apart. As federal agents raided Muslim mosques, charities and businesses, the most prominent Salafis vanished from clerical life or landed in prison. Some of the movement's key figures were convicted on charges unrelated to terrorism, ranging from tax evasion to visa-immigration violations. ''All of these people were jailed for different things, but if you look at them collectively, you see the Salafi movement,'' Idris Palmer, a onetime Salafi activist, told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law-enforcement officials say that there was no policy singling out Salafis. They were rushing to root out a new enemy, with little time to grasp the theological differences separating nonviolent fundamentalists from the creed of the hijackers. Many agents did not even know what a Salafi was ''and still don't,'' says Christopher Heffelfinger, a security analyst who consults with the government. Northern Virginia -- then a nexus of the American Salafi movement given its proximity to the Saudi Embassy -- became a focal point. Anwar al-Awlaki was still preaching in Virginia when federal agents raided 15 local Islamic offices and homes. ''It's a war against Muslims and Islam,'' Awlaki bellowed in an audio address. ''It's happening right here in America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most high-profile Virginia case involved Qadhi's onetime mentor, Ali al-Timimi, who regularly preached at a Falls Church mosque. At a dinner five days after 9/11, Timimi and some of the mosque's young congregants discussed how to respond. Prosecutors later accused Timimi of spurring the men to wage jihad against American troops overseas, saying they practiced shooting at a paintball facility. At issue in the case against Timimi were his words: his lawyers argued that he recommended that the men move to Muslim countries, while prosecutors said he was inciting jihad. They highlighted comments by Timimi unrelated to the dinner, including politically charged speeches and a statement in which he celebrated the Columbia Shuttle disaster. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Medina, Qadhi followed the case closely. For American clerics, he said, the message was clear: those who engage in controversial rhetoric are treading on thin ice. While 9/11 had shaken Qadhi's movement, it also unsettled him personally. ''No matter how strange this sounds, after having lived in Saudi Arabia for so long and also in America for so long, I could fully understand the fear, the anger, the frustration, the paranoia on both sides,'' Qadhi says. ''I could understand 'they' and 'us.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi began to wrestle with some of his own beliefs. It troubled him that Salafiya, even in its nonmilitant form, had helped shape the ideology of groups like Al Qaeda. ''What type of Islam are we going to teach people?'' he recalled thinking. ''This isolationist Islam? This Islam of 'us' versus 'them' -- is that healthy? Is that what my religion is?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Qadhi was on track to become Medina's first American doctoral candidate. He wondered if he had a more promising future in America, where the Salafi movement, bereft of leaders, was in crisis. From Houston, Qadhi's father -- who had retired and was volunteering as a prison chaplain -- encouraged his son to leave Saudi Arabia, which he believed had left Qadhi ''totally brainwashed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I said, 'Come back to America; this is your land,' '' Kazi said in an interview at his home, sitting in what he called his ''Archie Bunker chair.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Qadhi applied to Yale. Some of his contemporaries saw the move as strategic. ''It was a stepping stone,'' Imam Abdullah T. Antepli, the Muslim chaplain at Duke University, told me. ''He knew that with that Yale ticket, people would take him more seriously.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi's Saudi professors were aghast that he would switch to a Western university to study Islam. Yale's professors were also surprised. The religious-studies department had never taken on a graduate of the Saudi educational system. ''You admit someone from Saudi Arabia, you don't know how much intolerance you let into an American university,'' says Frank Griffel, a professor of Islamic studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Qadhi impressed Griffel as ''profoundly intelligent'' and willing to engage in critical thinking. At Medina, Qadhi's studies revolved around the search for an absolute religious truth. At Yale, the line of inquiry was markedly different. In Qadhi's first class with Griffel in the fall of 2005, the subject was a 12th-century Sufi jurist. ''You, Yasir, probably know more about this guy,'' Griffel said. ''But we're going to study how to study him.'' Qadhi was struck by this analytical approach. ''The question is more historical in nature -- it's about where did this idea come from, how did it affect later ideas,'' Qadhi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Qadhi, the Koran remained the unequivocal word of God. But he began to think more critically about the ''man-made'' canon that informed Islamic theology. So much of Qadhi's intransigence -- especially toward other Muslim sects -- was based on the view that his tradition was divinely ordained. He came to see Salafiya as yet another ''human development'' that was handed down over generations and therefore subject to imperfection. ''I realized that, in many issues, only God knows the ultimate truth,'' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi landed on the American preaching circuit with force, and his following skyrocketed among young Salafis. America's leading clerics were converts who had risen to prominence because they could translate an intricate theology into an American vernacular. Qadhi did the same but as the proud son of Muslim immigrants. Plus he was a Salafi -- or so it seemed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 2006, at a conference in Copenhagen, Qadhi did the unthinkable: he shook a woman's hand in a spontaneous challenge to her perception of fundamentalists, he said. The woman, Mona Eltahawy, a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues, wrote about the exchange, which became known in Salafi circles as the ''when-Yasir-met-Mona moment.'' The handshake drew a death threat from a man in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following year, Qadhi further pushed the limits, making a pact of ''mutual respect and cooperation'' with American clerics of the Sufi order, Salafiya's longtime enemy. Several of Qadhi's former Saudi professors publicly assailed him, a signal he had become too prominent for them to ignore. --Qadhi began to step away from the Salafi label, rebranding his movement ''orthodox with a capital O.'' While he remained devoted to Salafiya's core tenets, his followers struggled to keep pace with his changes. Others remained skeptical. ''Is he being instrumental and opportunistic, or has he really abandoned some of these Salafi beliefs?'' said Haykel, the Princeton professor. ''He's engaged in an incredible performance of reinvention that I'm not sure he'll be able to pull off.'' The same question hovered over Qadhi's institute, whose founder, Alshareef, once gave a sermon titled ''Why the Jews Were Cursed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, as Qadhi honed a new message, he was roundly dismissed on jihadist forums as a ''sellout.'' One detractor was Samir Khan, a young blogger from North Carolina who eventually moved to Yemen and now runs the Al Qaeda magazine, Inspire, according to law-enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Khan was still living in the United States in 2007, he wrote several blog posts about Qadhi. ''He has done good, and we do not deny this,'' read one. But Qadhi's ''wrongdoings,'' he continued, ''can destroy the Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspicion surrounded Qadhi. In February 2006, he was crossing from Canada into the United States when American border agents pulled aside his van and ushered his family into a room. An agent told Qadhi he was ''waiting for permission from Washington'' to let Qadhi back into the country, he recalled. They were freed more than five hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the first sign that Qadhi was on the terrorist watch list. From then on, he and his family traveled separately. ''I'm not going to be humiliated in front of my kids,'' he said. At airports, he became accustomed to long interviews with border agents, who downloaded his laptop hard drive and searched his cellphone. They photocopied notes he kept on his sermons and even asked for his definition of jihad. F.B.I. agents in New Haven questioned him about two American acquaintances who had been charged with terrorism-related offenses. Qadhi said he knew nothing of their activities, but the agents pressed him to report on anyone who expressed views that ''might be of interest,'' he recalled. He refused, saying, ''This is America, not Soviet Russia or East Germany.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, Qadhi felt backed into a corner. In August 2006, at a meeting for Muslim leaders in Houston, he walked up to Daniel W. Sutherland, a Homeland Security official. ''Hi, I'm a pacifist Salafi,'' Qadhi said to him. Looking stunned, Sutherland sat and talked with Qadhi for more than an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in May 2008, Qadhi received an invitation from Quintan Wiktorowicz, an analyst for a government agency that was hosting a conference on counterradicalization. (Wiktorowicz was recently named a senior director at the National Security Council.) In attendance were British and American intelligence officials, including the director of Homeland Security at the time, Michael Chertoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a break, Qadhi spotted a Houston acquaintance who happened to work for Chertoff. ''I said, 'Don't you think it's ironic that on the one hand, you're reaching out for my expertise and wanting my help, and on the other hand, you're harassing and intimidating me as if I'm a potential terrorist?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the West, jihad is often depicted as a self-contained, violent cause. But in Qadhi's world, it exists within a panoply of complex and overlapping issues. The most immediate question is not whether to fight overseas but how to make peace living in the pluralistic West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debates pivot on arcane theological points from the ninth century, a time when religious empires reigned, not secular nations. Classical scholars reference a world divided between dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, and dar al-harb, the land of war. But which land is America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we're not at war, why is America killing Muslims throughout the world?'' says Basil Gohar, 30, who has studied with Qadhi. ''If we are at war, how can we live in America peacefully?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even absent the question of war, Western Salafis ponder their loyalties. Internet forums buzz with talk about the concept of al-walaa wal-baraa, which is rooted in Koranic verses dictating allegiance to Muslims over non-Muslims. Qadhi's students are divided over whether to vote, pay taxes that support the military or even celebrate Thanksgiving. ''These sorts of things, they are the fault lines,'' says Okoye, the student from Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi sees in his students an earlier version of himself -- the passionate Salafi who took comfort in a black-and-white world. He prods them to think ''in colors'' and find a balance between loyalty to Islam and to America. He urges them to pay taxes and vote, drawing the line at military service, given Iraq and Afghanistan. ''There is no draft,'' he said. ''Thank God for that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Qadhi and his students, nothing tested those loyalties more than the events after the underwear-bomb plot of December 2009. Whenever a terrorism suspect is identified, AlMaghrib runs the name through its database of alumni to see if there is a match. ''Oh, my God,'' Qadhi said when a colleague told him that the 23-year-old suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had been his student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi searched his memory. The son of a prominent banker, Abdulmutallab had been living and studying in London. He had taken two AlMaghrib classes before attending the institute's 16-day Houston conference in 2008. There, Abdulmutallab kept mostly to himself. ''He never got into political issues,'' says Abdul-Malik Ryan, 36, a lawyer from Chicago who studied with him every morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As media outlets discovered the connection, AlMaghrib's leaders rushed to contain a crisis. The institute's vice president, Waleed Basyouni, reached out to the F.B.I.'s Houston field office. Agents wanted to interview all 156 students who attended the 2008 conference. ''I said, 'If you start going to our students and terrifying them, and they stop coming, we will close down,' '' he recalled telling the agents. '' 'You would be pushing the students to go to basements, small circles, on the Internet. So it's in your benefit that this organization stay open.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous cases, F.B.I. agents dropped by the homes of some AlMaghrib students, unannounced. This time, they issued a subpoena but agreed to arrange interviews in advance and to send female agents to question the women. The clerics urged the students to cooperate, but many balked, prompting Qadhi's 50-minute conference call from Yale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veering between high-pitched emotion and tedious scholarship, Qadhi argued that the case presented no conflict of loyalties because Abdulmutallab, by all appearances, committed a crime, violating both American and Islamic law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, one student asked, what about America's transgressions? Why was Qadhi focused on the militants? He responded that he had bluntly criticized American policies to State Department and other officials, telling them ''the root cause of this terrorism is terrorism perpetrated at the state level.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Qadhi urged his students to ''chill out'' and use common sense. ''You need to look at the repercussions of what you are going to do to yourself, to your family, to your society and to the Muslims that are around you,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students cooperated, and in subsequent meetings with the F.B.I., an agent told Qadhi and Basyouni that the bureau did not consider AlMaghrib a terrorist threat, said the clerics. (An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment about Qadhi or the investigation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abdulmutallab episode drew a new line in the long-distance battle between Qadhi and Awlaki. The Yemeni-American cleric announced that Abdulmutallab's operation was in retaliation for American ''cruise missiles and cluster bombs.'' By then, the United States had authorized the assassination of Awlaki, provoking outrage among many of Qadhi's students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi seemed to be riding a pendulum of self-preservation. If he lurched too far toward appeasing the government, he risked losing his base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That March, Qadhi rose before a crowd of thousands in Elizabeth, N.J., to finally speak about Awlaki. ''I am against this preacher when he tells our youth to become militant against this country while being citizens to this country,'' Qadhi told the packed auditorium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But when my government comes and says, 'We're allowed to take him out; we're allowed to kill him; we're allowed to assassinate him,' I also put my foot down, and I say to my own government, 'Shame on you!' '' The audience listened raptly. ''Be angry every time a bomb is dropped on innocent civilians in the name of the war on terror,'' Qadhi bellowed. ''Be angry every time our tax dollars are spent to oppress yet another group of innocent Palestinians. Be angry every time more draconian measures are utilized against us in this greatest democracy on earth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never before had Qadhi so forcefully condemned America's policies in public. But ''channel that anger,'' he continued, ''in a productive manner.'' He urged a ''jihad of the tongue, a jihad of the pen, a jihad that is not a military jihad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Muslims, Qadhi told the audience, needed to abide by the laws of their country, understanding that had they been born in Palestine or Iraq, their ''responsibilities would be different.'' He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this kind of ambiguity that gnaws at some of Qadhi's students. ''We just get wishy-washy nonanswers,'' one female student told me, adding that Qadhi's ''jihad of the tongue'' was unconvincing. Being martyred in the battlefield, she said, is ''romantic,'' while ''lobbying your congressman is not.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to prayer soars through the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Houston, its lobby adorned with a fresco of the Texan flag. Every summer, AlMaghrib's most-devoted students convene here for a two-week Ilm Summit, transforming the ballroom floor -- a corporate tableaux of overstuffed sofas and dim lighting -- into a version of Islamic utopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ilm,'' in Arabic, means ''knowledge.'' From dawn to night, the students immerse themselves in advanced Islamic theology and Koran recitation under the guidance of Qadhi and other clerics. The men favor long tunics, and some women wear niqabs, the full-face veil. Most are upper-middle-class college students of South Asian descent who pay $1,500 to attend. To the hotel's Hispanic waiters, they seem otherworldly. The men and women eat, study and even ride the elevators separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the so-called AlMaghribis upend easy stereotypes. The women are a forceful presence in class and can be spotted on breaks engaging in fierce arm-wrestling matches. The most dominant trait among the men is a quintessentially American geekiness. Qadhi, like many of his students, is a ''Star Trek'' fan. His lectures are laid out on PowerPoint as students crouch over laptops. Between classes, talk often turns to the latest AlMaghribi courtship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood darkened last July after Qadhi announced that agents from the local F.B.I. office would be dropping by for a ''roundtable discussion.'' The ballroom fell to a hush as Qadhi and Basyouni led Brad Deardorff, supervisory special agent of the Houston division, to the stage. He smiled tentatively as Qadhi began a quick speech about the need to counteract extremism. Deardorff talked about the history of militant movements, saying there was ''no standard profile for an Islamist terrorist.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the students' questions, submitted in writing. ''How do you expect us to help you'' read one question, ''when there are F.B.I. informants in our mosques?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Jeez, that's a tough question,'' Deardorff said. ''We don't target mosques. We do collect domestic intelligence. But mosques are buildings. Mosques don't conspire. Mosques don't blow things up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students stared at him incredulously. It struck some as ironic that Qadhi would engage in a public discussion with the F.B.I. about ''terrorism'' -- which they deemed a loaded word -- when the underlying theological issues remained off limits. In a poll last year on Qadhi's blog, Muslim Matters, participants ranked ''jihad'' as the No. 1 subject in which they wanted academic instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several kinds of jihad, which is translated to mean ''striving in the path of God.'' While progressive Muslims emphasize the spiritual form, Qadhi and other conservatives say that the majority of the Koran's references to jihad are to military struggle. Qadhi's interpretation makes him neither a hardline militant nor a pure pacifist. While he unequivocally denounces violence against civilians, he believes Muslims have the right to defend themselves from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he says ''offensive jihad''-- the spread of the Islamic state by force -- is permissible only when ordered by a legitimate caliph, or global Muslim ruler, which is nonexistent in today's world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such fine distinctions were less pronounced before 9/11, when Qadhi and others preached openly about the glory of Islam's early military triumphs. In a decade-old sermon about one of Islam's landmark battles, Qadhi said, ''once a prophet has become ready for jihad, for fighting, then he will not take off his armor until he has actually met the enemy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he returned to the United States in 2005, AlMaghrib had canceled a popular class on Islam's military history, and its instructors largely avoided current events. Some students inferred from Qadhi's silence a tacit support for militant groups. ''Everyone was always like: 'We know he believes it. He can't say it publicly,' '' recalled Lauren Morgan, who is 26 and a former student of Qadhi's. She said she and other students had openly sympathized with militants. ''I think if you're going down the Salafi interstate, the jihadi exit is open for you,'' Morgan said. ''It's there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students first heard Qadhi denounce jihadist movements almost a year after the London bombings. That same month, June 2006, AlMaghrib released a statement calling terrorism ''a perversion of the true Islamic teachings.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central contest between Qadhi and militants like Awlaki hinges on a rather abstruse point: how to define America in Islamic terms. Qadhi likens his country to Abyssinia, the seventh-century African kingdom that gave refuge to the prophet's followers. In exchange for upholding the laws of the land, they were allowed to worship freely -- a contract Qadhi equates to an American passport or visa. Breaking the contract by joining militant groups at war with America constitutes treachery, Qadhi says, which is forbidden in Islam. Awlaki, by contrast, compares America with ancient Mecca, where the prophet's followers were persecuted, forcing them to flee and later fight back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics take issue with the technical nature of the debate. Qadhi's students, they argue, could conclude that joining a militant group is permissible provided they renounce their citizenship. This is further complicated by his refusal to address whether the Islamist uprisings in Iraq and Afghanistan constitute legitimate jihads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying yes would open the door to public recriminations, but denying the legitimacy of those insurgencies would fly in the face of Islamic law, says Andrew F. March, a professor at Yale who specializes in Islamic law. ''The conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine are unambiguous examples of jihad or war against an outside invader,'' March says. ''There is no mainstream juridical opinion that says that Muslims cannot resist that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under mounting pressure from students, Qadhi and another AlMaghrib scholar, Abu Eesa Niamatullah, considered teaching a course on the fiqh, or jurisprudence, of jihad. ''What stopped us?'' Niamatullah says. ''Picture two bearded guys talking about the fiqh of jihad. We would be dead. We would be absolutely finished.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 18, Qadhi posted a 5,000-word essay on his blog, trying to jump-start a discussion on jihad. He argued that extremists cherry-pick verses from the Koran to justify actions antithetical to the faith, while United States policy also plays a central role in radicalizing Muslim youth. What Abdulmutallab did not hear at AlMaghrib, Qadhi lamented, ''was a discourse regarding the current political and social ills that he felt so passionately about, and a frank dialogue about the Islamic method for correcting such ills.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is an awkward position to be in,'' he wrote of his situation. ''How can one simultaneously fight against a powerful government, a pervasive and sensationalist-prone media and a group of overzealous, rash youth who are already predisposed to reject your message, because they view you as being a part of the establishment (while, ironically, the 'establishment' never ceases to view you as part of the radicals)?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One week later, Qadhi was flying through Dallas. He had traveled free of hassle for nine months and seemed to be off the watch list. But now, border agents were stopping him. They wanted to ask a few questions. ''Here we go again,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi's ambiguous relationship with the government reflects a quandary facing the Obama administration: whether to engage with Muslims across the ideological spectrum. While many American Muslim leaders have been hit by accusations of extremism, Qadhi is a natural target. Self-described terrorism watchdogs refer to AlMaghrib as ''Jihad U.,'' and last year, a Fox News reporter called Qadhi a ''wolf in sheep's clothing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Qadhi hardly seems the caricature of his critics' rendering -- the stealth Islamist plotting a shariah takeover of the White House -- his views reflect a vision that many Americans would find objectionable. He hopes that the world will someday fully adhere to his faith, he said, conceding that it would most likely be ''not in my lifetime.'' Egypt's recent uprising, he wrote on his blog, illustrates that change cannot come from militancy but ''begins in the heart and in the home, and it shall eventually reach the streets and shake the foundations of government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the administration confronts domestic radicalization, some government analysts say they have much to learn from clerics like Qadhi. ''We're trying to get our arms around how to engage with Yasir and people like him,'' a senior counterterrorism official told me. ''It's a new issue.'' One concern, officials told me, is their uncertainty about how world events might harden the thinking of clerics like Qadhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the search for answers, the Obama administration has studied counterradicalization approaches overseas. In Europe, some policy makers argue that nonmilitant fundamentalists are the problem, not the solution, because their rigid interpretation of Islam fuels the very radicalization they profess to fight. The British government was rebuked for providing funds to nonmilitant Salafi organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Constitution would prevent such financing. But the question remains to what extent the administration will consult with nonviolent fundamentalists or help them by creating what Qadhi and others call ''a safe space'' in which Muslims are free to discuss controversial issues without the fear of repercussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a way to stop extremism,'' he claimed, ''but it's not palatable for Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qadhi recently went live with a Web site devoted to issues of jihad. He is calling it The J Word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other American clerics have also begun to speak out, most notably Imam Zaid Shakir, who posted a widely read letter online aimed at dissuading the ''would-be mujahid,'' or warrior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone are the days when Qadhi would dismiss teaming up with clerics of different schools. There were too few Salafis left in America. ''I need help,'' Qadhi told me one afternoon last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was sitting in the library of his new home, where more than 10,000 books line the cherry-stained shelves. Memphis is a long way from the centers of Islamic thought -- places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It would be folly, Qadhi said, to think that a young American cleric could solve the theological puzzles that have invited centuries of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was certain of one thing: only America's clerics could lead the way forward for their young flocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''American Muslims are at the forefront in battling Islamic extremism because they have everything to lose if anything else happens,'' Qadhi said. ''They'll lose their American identity, and they'll lose their prestige, whatever prestige remains of our religion that we would like to have in this land.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan Taliban are showing signs of increasing strain after a number of killings, arrests and internal disputes that have reached them even in their haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Afghan security officials and Afghans with contacts in the Taliban say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings, coming just as the insurgents are mobilizing for the new fighting season in Afghanistan, have unnerved many in the Taliban and have spread a climate of paranoia and distrust within the insurgent movement, the Afghans said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three powerful Taliban commanders were killed in February in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, well known to be the command center of the Taliban leadership, according to an Afghan businessman and a mujahedeen commander from the region with links to the Taliban. A fourth commander, a former Taliban minister, was wounded in the border town of Chaman in March, in a widely reported shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been several arrests in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of senior Taliban commanders, including those from Zabul and Kabul Provinces, and the shadow governor of Herat, Afghan officials said. Mullah Agha Muhammad, a brother of Mullah Baradar, the former second in command of the Taliban who was arrested by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces over a year ago to stop him negotiating with the Afghan government, was also detained briefly to send out the same warning, said the chief of the Afghan border police in Kandahar, Col. Abdul Razziq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the arrests have been conducted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces, no one seems to know for sure who is behind the killings. Members of the Taliban attribute them to American spies, running Pakistani and Afghan agents, in an extension of the American campaigns that have used night raids to track down and kill scores of midlevel Taliban commanders in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill militants with links to Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, including Pakistani and Afghan Parliament members from the region, say that the Pakistani intelligence agencies have long used threats, arrests and killings to control the Taliban and that they could be doing so again to maintain their influence over the insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan officials in Kabul denied any involvement in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as did American and NATO military officials. ''We've heard of infighting that reportedly has led to internal violence at several points in recent months,'' one senior American military official said of the Taliban, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of discussing events in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Military forces were not involved, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, Taliban commanders and fighters, who used to be a common sight in parts of Quetta, have now gone underground and are not moving around openly as before. Two members of the Taliban, including a senior official, declined to talk about the issue of killings on the telephone, saying it was too dangerous. Many will not answer their phones at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban have been under stress since American forces doubled their presence in southern Afghanistan last year and greatly increased the number of special forces raids targeting Taliban commanders. Yet they still control a number of remote districts and in those areas the insurgents can still muster forces to storm government positions, as demonstrated by their capture of a district in Afghanistan's eastern Nuristan Province this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is still some debate over the insurgents' overall strength, Pakistanis with deep knowledge of the Afghan Taliban say that they have suffered heavy losses in the last year and that they are struggling in some areas to continue the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Afghan Taliban have, I think, run into problems,'' said Rustam Shah Mohmand, a former Pakistani interior minister who served as ambassador in Afghanistan after 2001 and as a peace negotiator with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So many of them have been killed in the last one to one and a half years as a consequence of targeted assassinations,'' he said in an interview. ''That has depleted the strength, capacity and ability of the Taliban.'' Commanders were without communications and resources and were struggling to find recruits to replace those killed, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Taliban commander from Kunar Province said losses had been so high that he was considering going over to the side of the Afghan government in order to get assistance for his beleaguered community. ''This does not mean the Taliban will stop fighting, but maybe it will be at a reduced level,'' Mr. Mohmand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurgents have already switched tactics to suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on soft targets -- such as recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a bank, an army recruitment center and a construction company that all caused high casualties -- because they are not capable of confronting American and NATO forces in conventional battles, said Samina Ahmed, director of the International Crisis Group in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban have always been able to survive temporary setbacks on the battlefield by pulling back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where many have homes and businesses. Fighters have also found sanctuary and medical care in the anonymity of the refugee camps where over a million Afghans have lived for a generation through Afghanistan's various wars, and in the outlying suburbs of Pakistani cities like Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a much more uncertain environment for the Taliban as the new civilian government is openly hostile to them, the military seeks to control them and influence any future settlement they make with Kabul, and the United States increases its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, two former ambassadors, Lakhdar Brahimi and Thomas Pickering, who lead an International Task Force on Afghanistan, reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the anti-American spy mania that seized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after an American working for the C.I.A., Raymond A. Davis, shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore on Jan. 27, Pakistani officials and politicians have accused the C.I.A. of running numerous covert programs around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani intelligence official confirmed that C.I.A. operatives were using their own local agents to target Qaeda-linked militants with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, and speculated that they could be trying to expand that campaign to reach other Pakistani militants and Afghan Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. has been formulating such a plan for months, according to two former Afghan security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the covert nature of their work. The Americans have been using tribesmen, including members of the Taliban they have turned, to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other Taliban groups in the border areas, one of the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others, including officials on both sides of the border, said it could be the work of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their method is brutality,'' Abdul Rahim Mandokhail, a Pakistani senator from the southwestern border region near Quetta, said of the ISI. ''If there is only a little opposition, their method is to kill the man,'' he said. He had no specific information on recent killings, because it was too dangerous to investigate such things, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani government official working in the border region said both American and Pakistani intelligence agencies favored different insurgent groups and were striking at each other's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three commanders killed in Quetta last month all led units fighting in Marja, in Helmand, the southern Afghan province where American Marines have struggled to establish security after more than a year of counterinsurgency operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the commanders was Hajji Khalil, in his late 30s, who commanded several groups of fighters in Marja, according to Baz Gul Khan, a pro-government militia leader in Marja. ''He was famous in all of Marja,'' Mr. Khan said. ''He had about 300 men or more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hajji Khalil was killed in his own house, by two men who appeared to be Taliban who stayed the night with him in his guest room. The two men left unseen by the street entrance, and the next morning Hajji Khalil's family found him slain in the room, an Afghan businessman who is close to the Taliban said. He did not want to be named for fear of his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another commander, known as Mansour, was gunned down while riding his motorbike along Saryab Road west of the city. He led up to five units of men in Marja and operated out of a rented house in Quetta, a clear sign that he enjoyed the patronage of the ISI, the businessman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not know the name of the third Taliban commander who was killed but said that he was also from Marja and that he was responsible for communication between the senior Taliban and the fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fourth commander, Manzoor Ahmed, the former Taliban sports minister, was shot four times by unidentified assailants on the way to his office in the border town of Chaman on March 3, the official Pakistani news agency, The Associated Press of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, reported. Still, he survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militia leader, Mr. Khan, said the killings were a sign that the Taliban was in decline. ''We have a saying, that when a goat becomes sick, he attracts every disease,'' he said. ''I think the Taliban have lost momentum, they are losing the fight and so the Pakistanis do not need them and so they will kill them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American, NATO and Afghan officials said Taliban leaders are struggling to adapt to the pressures on the movement after heavy losses on the battlefield last year and are finding commanders reluctant to return to Afghanistan fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Almost 900 were killed last year,'' a senior Afghan security official said. ''And now the commanders are telling their leaders: 'You have a nice life, your kids are in school, you are going on trips to Dubai, and you are telling us to go and fight?' ''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan Taliban are showing signs of increasing strain after a number of killings, arrests and internal disputes that have reached them even in their haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Afghan security officials and Afghans with contacts in the Taliban say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings, coming just as the insurgents are mobilizing for the new fighting season in Afghanistan, have unnerved many in the Taliban and have spread a climate of paranoia and distrust within the insurgent movement, the Afghans said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three powerful Taliban commanders were killed in February in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, well known to be the command center of the Taliban leadership, according to an Afghan businessman and a mujahedeen commander from the region with links to the Taliban. A fourth commander, a former Taliban minister, was shot four times by unidentified assailants in the border town of Chaman in March, and survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been several arrests in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of senior Taliban commanders, including those from Zabul and Kabul Provinces, and the shadow governor of Herat, Afghan officials said. Mullah Agha Muhammad, a brother of Mullah Baradar, the former second in command of the Taliban who was arrested by Pakistani security forces over a year ago to stop him from negotiating with the Afghan government, was also held briefly to send the same warning, said the chief of the Afghan border police in Kandahar, Col. Abdul Razziq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the arrests have been conducted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces, it is not clear who is behind the killings. Members of the Taliban attribute them to American spies, running Pakistani and Afghan agents, in an extension of the American campaigns that have used night raids to track down and kill scores of midlevel Taliban commanders in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill militants with links to Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, including Pakistani and Afghan Parliament members from the region, say that the Pakistani intelligence agencies have long used threats, arrests and killings to control the Taliban and that they could be doing so again to maintain their influence over the insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan officials in Kabul denied any involvement in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as did American and NATO military officials. ''We've heard of infighting that reportedly has led to internal violence at several points in recent months,'' one senior American military official said of the Taliban, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of discussing events in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Military forces were not involved, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, Taliban commanders and fighters, who used to be a common sight in parts of Quetta, have now gone underground and are not moving around openly as before. Two members of the Taliban, including a senior official, declined to talk about the issue of killings on the telephone, saying it was too dangerous. Many will not answer their phones at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban have been under stress since American forces doubled their presence in southern Afghanistan last year and greatly increased the number of special forces raids aimed at hunting down Taliban commanders. Yet they still control a number of remote districts, and in those areas the insurgents can still muster forces to storm government positions, as demonstrated by their capture of a district in Afghanistan's eastern Nuristan Province this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is still some debate over the insurgents' overall strength, Pakistanis with deep knowledge of the Afghan Taliban say that they have suffered heavy losses in the last year and that they are struggling in some areas to continue the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Afghan Taliban have, I think, run into problems,'' said Rustam Shah Mohmand, a former Pakistani interior minister who served as ambassador in Afghanistan after 2001 and as a peace negotiator with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So many of them have been killed in the last one to one and a half years as a consequence of targeted assassinations,'' he said in an interview. ''That has depleted the strength, capacity and ability of the Taliban.'' Commanders were without communications and resources and were struggling to find recruits to replace those killed, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Taliban commander from Kunar Province said losses had been so high that he was considering going over to the side of the Afghan government in order to get assistance for his beleaguered community. ''This does not mean the Taliban will stop fighting, but maybe it will be at a reduced level,'' Mr. Mohmand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurgents have already switched tactics to suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on soft targets -- such as recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a bank, an army recruitment center and a construction company that all caused high casualties -- because they are not capable of confronting American and NATO forces in conventional battles, said Samina Ahmed, director of the International Crisis Group in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban have always been able to survive temporary setbacks on the battlefield by pulling back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where many have homes and businesses. Fighters have also found sanctuary and medical care in the anonymity of the refugee camps where over a million Afghans have lived for a generation through Afghanistan's various wars, and in the outlying suburbs of Pakistani cities like Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a much more uncertain environment for the Taliban as the new civilian government is openly hostile to them, the military seeks to control them and influence any future settlement they make with Kabul, and the United States increases its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, two former ambassadors, Lakhdar Brahimi and Thomas Pickering, who lead an International Task Force on Afghanistan, reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the anti-American spy mania that seized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after an American working for the C.I.A., Raymond A. Davis, shot and killed two men in the city of Lahore on Jan. 27, Pakistani officials and politicians have accused the C.I.A. of running numerous covert programs around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani intelligence official confirmed that C.I.A. operatives were using their own local agents to target Qaeda-linked militants with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, and speculated that they could be trying to expand that campaign to reach other Pakistani militants and Afghan Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. has been formulating such a plan for months, according to two former Afghan security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the covert nature of their work. The Americans have been using tribesmen, including members of the Taliban they have turned, to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other Taliban groups in the border areas, one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others, including officials on both sides of the border, said it could be the work of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their method is brutality,'' Abdul Rahim Mandokhail, a Pakistani senator from the southwestern border region near Quetta, said of the ISI. ''If there is only a little opposition, their method is to kill the man,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani government official working in the border region said both American and Pakistani intelligence agencies favored different insurgent groups and were striking at each other's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three commanders killed in Quetta last month all led units fighting in Marja, in Helmand, the southern Afghan province where American Marines have struggled to establish security after more than a year of counterinsurgency operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the commanders was Hajji Khalil, in his late 30s, who commanded several groups of fighters in Marja, according to Baz Gul Khan, a pro-government militia leader in Marja.

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Counterterrorism operations in Yemen have ground to a halt, allowing Al Qaeda's deadliest branch outside of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to operate more freely inside the country and to increase plotting for possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Europe and the United States, American diplomats, intelligence analysts and counterterrorism officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the political tumult surrounding Yemen's embattled president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, many Yemeni troops have abandoned their posts or have been summoned to the capital, Sana, to help support the tottering government, the officials said. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group's affiliate, has stepped in to fill this power vacuum, and Yemeni security forces have come under increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small but steadily growing stream of Qaeda fighters and lower-level commanders from other parts of the world, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, are making their way to Yemen to join the fight there, although American intelligence officials are divided on whether the political crisis in Yemen is drawing more insurgents than would be traveling there under normal conditions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, these developments have raised increasing alarm in the Obama administration, which is in the delicate position of trying to ease Mr. Saleh out of power, but in a way to ensure that counterterrorism operations in Yemen will continue unimpeded. These developments may also help explain why the United States has become less willing to support Mr. Saleh, a close ally, given that his value in fighting terrorism has been diminished since demonstrations swept his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts on Yemen who have observed Mr. Saleh's long domination through political shrewdness speculated that he might be deliberately withdrawing his forces from pursuing Al Qaeda to worsen the sense of crisis and force the Americans to back him, rather than push him toward the exits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a senior American military officer with access to classified intelligence reports discounted those doubts on Monday: ''This is a reflection of the turmoil in the country, not some political decision to stop.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Saleh's son and three nephews are in charge of four of Yemen's main security and counterterrorism agencies, including the Republican Guard and the Central Security Forces, which are trained and equipped by the United States. If they were forced to step down as part of any deal to remove Mr. Saleh, American officials acknowledge that the country's counterterrorism efforts would be left in the hands of untested lieutenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have had a lot of counterterrorism cooperation from President Saleh and Yemeni security services,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said March 27 on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''So if that government collapses or is replaced by one that is dramatically more weak, then I think we'll face some additional challenges out of Yemen. There's no question about it. It's a real problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most worrisome, American intelligence officials have collected information from informants and electronic intercepts that Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen has increased planning discussions about another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This increased threat ''chatter,'' as intelligence officials call the reports, was first reported by The Washington Post late last month, but officials say the trend has continued since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Qaeda group in Yemen is responsible for failed plots to blow up a commercial airliner as it approached Detroit on Dec. 25, 2009, and for planting printer cartridges packed with explosives on cargo planes bound for Chicago last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States now has about 75 Special Forces trainers and support personnel in Yemen, as well as an unspecified number of Central Intelligence Agency operatives. The Americans in Yemen are working closely with dozens of British special forces and intelligence officers, as well as operatives from Saudi Arabia's spy agencies. While the Americans largely provide intelligence, the Yemeni counterterrorism troops have conducted raids and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on suspected terrorists in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspension of these Yemeni counterterrorism operations and the heightened Al Qaeda activity have prompted the United States Central Command to dust off plans to resume airstrikes against top Qaeda targets if the United States receives solid intelligence about the location of senior militants, a senior military official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has not carried out such airstrikes in Yemen since last May, when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accidentally killed a deputy governor and set off a huge political dispute with Mr. Saleh. Last year, the United States quietly began patrolling Yemen with armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One top insurgent on the American target list is Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American cleric who is a top propagandist for Al Qaeda. Last Wednesday, Mr. Awlaki broke his silence on the uprisings in the Arab world to speak glowingly in a new issue of the English-language Qaeda magazine Inspire about the toppling of autocratic governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon officials said that the chaotic security conditions in the country might embolden senior Qaeda officials in Yemen to come out of hiding. ''If we have Awlaki in our sights, we'll take a shot,'' the senior American military officer said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, however, the American Special Forces in Yemen have shifted their focus to help the Yemeni security forces carrying out the counterterrorism missions. But those programs to train and assist the Yemenis have also been suspended in the wake of the political tumult. The American Special Forces soldiers are keeping a low profile but are maintaining ties with midlevel and senior Yemeni officers, and provide information on how the military is reacting to the upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials privately concede they have only a marginal influence on Mr. Saleh's fight for his political survival and exit from power. At best, these officials say, the Americans are looking to identify and carefully support competent lower-ranking officers and civilian officials who could take over the security agencies if Mr. Saleh's relatives are forced to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Johnsen, a Princeton scholar who closely tracks militants in Yemen, said the United States' narrow focus on combating Al Qaeda through military operations overseen by Mr. Saleh and his family means its position could be precarious in a post-Saleh Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The U.S. idea of tying counterterrorism to this one family has not been the best way to approach the Al Qaeda problem,'' said Mr. Johnsen, who has argued for greater focus on development aid for the impoverished country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yemeni government's already weak reach is withering by the day, as violent convulsions rack several parts of the impoverished country. American officials said they were watching unrest in Shabwa Province, a Qaeda stronghold, as well as in Jaar, a city in the southern province of Abyan where Al Qaeda is known to have set up a base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer in Yemen's counterterrorism forces said his unit had not been deployed and was on standby, even though much of the south was apparently outside government control and jihadists had apparently declared a separate emirate in Abyan. Yemeni counterterrorism officers would like to respond, but ''we are only door-kickers,'' he said. ''We need support from the army, and the army is busy splitting.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has demanded that the United States steeply reduce the number of Central Intelligence Agency operatives and Special Operations forces working in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and that it halt C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at militants in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The request was a sign of the near collapse of cooperation between the two testy allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani and American officials said in interviews that the demand that the United States scale back its presence was the immediate fallout from the arrest in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Raymond A. Davis, a C.I.A. security officer who killed two men in January during what he said was an attempt to rob him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, about 335 American personnel -- C.I.A. officers and contractors and Special Operations forces -- were being asked to leave the country, said a Pakistani official closely involved in the decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear how many C.I.A. personnel that would leave behind; the total number in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not been disclosed. But the cuts demanded by the Pakistanis amounted to 25 to 40 percent of United States Special Operations forces in the country, the officials said. The number also included the removal of all the American contractors used by the C.I.A. in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demands appeared severe enough to badly hamper American efforts -- either through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Pakistani military training -- to combat militants who use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a base to fight American forces in Afghanistan and plot terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reductions were personally demanded by the chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said Pakistani and American officials, who requested anonymity while discussing the delicate issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the Pakistani demands emerged as Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or the ISI, arrived in Washington on Monday for nearly four hours of meetings with the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two senior American officials said afterward that General Pasha did not make any specific requests for reductions of C.I.A. officers, contractors or American military personnel in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There were no ultimatums, no demands to withdraw tens or hundreds of Americans from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the tensions between the two spy services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A C.I.A. spokesman, George Little, called the meetings ''productive'' and said the relationship between the two services ''remains on solid footing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings were part of an effort to repair the already tentative and distrustful relations between the spy agencies. Those ties plunged to a new low as a result of the Davis episode, which has further exposed the divergence in Pakistani and American interests as the endgame in Afghanistan draws closer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Army firmly believes that Washington's real aim in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is to strip the nation of its prized nuclear arsenal, which is now on a path to becoming the world's fifth largest, said the Pakistani official closely involved in the decision on reducing the American presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the American side, frustration has built over the Pakistani Army's seeming inability to defeat a host of militant groups, including the Taliban and Al Qaeda, which have thrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas despite more than $1 billion in American assistance a year to the Pakistani military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rare public rebuke, a White House report to Congress last week described the Pakistani efforts against the militants as disappointing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his arrest, Mr. Davis was involved in a covert C.I.A. effort to penetrate one militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has ties to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence establishment, has made deepening inroads in Afghanistan, and is perceived as a global threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. had demanded that Mr. Davis be freed immediately, on the grounds that he had diplomatic immunity. Instead, he was held for 47 days of detention and, the officials said, questioned for 14 days by ISI agents during his imprisonment in Lahore, infuriating American officials. He was finally freed after his victims' families agreed to take some $2.3 million in compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another price, however, apparently is the list of reductions in American personnel demanded by General Kayani, according to the Pakistani and American officials. American officials said last year that the Pakistanis had allowed a maximum of 120 Special Operations troops in the country, most of them involved in training the paramilitary Frontier Corps in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Americans had reached that quota, the Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the withdrawal of all C.I.A. contractors, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is demanding the removal of C.I.A. operatives involved in ''unilateral'' assignments like Mr. Davis's that the Pakistani intelligence agency did not know about, the Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said without elaborating that the Pakistanis had asked ''for more visibility into some things'' -- presumably the nature of C.I.A. covert operations in the country -- ''and that request is being talked about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Kayani has also told the Obama administration that its expanded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign has gotten out of control, a Pakistani official said. Given the reluctance or inability of the Pakistani military to root out Qaeda and Taliban militants from the tribal areas, American officials have turned more and more to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drastically increasing the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, which is immensely unpopular among the Pakistani public, had become the sole preserve of the United States, the Pakistani official said, since the Americans were no longer sharing intelligence on how they were choosing targets. The Americans have also extended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to new parts of the tribal region, like the Khyber area near the city of Peshawar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kayani would like the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stopped,'' said another Pakistani official who met with the military chief recently. ''He believes they are used too frequently as a weapon of choice, rather than as a strategic weapon.'' Short of that, General Kayani was demanding that the campaign return to its original, more limited, scope and remain focused narrowly on North Waziristan, the prime militant stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month, one day after Mr. Davis was released, hit Taliban fighters in North Waziristan, but also killed tribal leaders allied with the Pakistani military, infuriating General Kayani, who issued an unusually strong statement of condemnation afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials defended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying it had achieved its goal of killing militants. But there have been no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Kayani's request to reduce the number of Special Operations troops by up to 40 percent would result in the closing of the training program begun last year at Warsak, close to Peshawar, an American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed by American officials that the Special Operations training would end even with the partial reduction of 40 percent, General Kayani remained unmoved, the American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials believed the training program was essential to improve the capacity of the nearly 150,000 Pakistani soldiers deployed to fight the Taliban in the tribal region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. quietly withdrew all contractors after Mr. Davis's arrest, the Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another category of American intelligence agents, declared operatives whose purpose was not clear, were also being asked to leave, the Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of the severity of the breach between the C.I.A. and the ISI, the official said: ''We're telling the Americans: 'You have to trust the ISI or you don't. There is nothing in between.' ''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- C.I.A.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired two missiles at militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas on Wednesday, two days after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy chief threatened to curtail the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and demanded more information about the Central Intelligence Agency's operations there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew a sharp rebuke from a Pakistani government that is increasingly public in its criticism of the C.I.A.'s covert role in its country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strongly condemns the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad, which said it had lodged ''a strong protest'' with the United States ambassador there, Cameron P. Munter. ''We have repeatedly said that such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are counterproductive and only contribute to strengthen the hands of the terrorists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the chief of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy agency, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to try to resolve tensions between the two counterterrorism allies, most recently over the arrest in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Raymond A. Davis, a C.I.A. security officer who killed two Pakistani men in January during what he said was a robbery attempt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting, American and Pakistani officials said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> request for advance notice of C.I.A. missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for fewer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over all, and for a fuller accounting of C.I.A. officers and contractors working in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''is being talked about.'' The American official added: ''The bottom line is that joint cooperation is essential to the security of the two nations. The stakes are too high.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the timing of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday served only to infuriate Pakistani officials and raised the question of whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would retaliate by shutting down American supply lines from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan, which it had done in previous disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was widely interpreted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, as a deliberate effort by Washington to embarrass the country. ''If the message was that business will continue as usual, it was a crude way of sending it,'' a senior Pakistani intelligence official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment. But an American official familiar with the operations defended the timing and targets, which came after a 27-day gap since the last </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on March 17, the day after Mr. Davis was released from Pakistani custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These operations are consistent with the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agreements that have been in place for some time,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political delicacy of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program. ''This was about protecting Americans in the region. This is not about sending a signal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The targets of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were militants commanded by Maulvi Nazir, a Taliban leader from South Waziristan who is closely allied to the Haqqani network, the main Afghan Taliban group supported by the Pakistani military. American and Pakistani intelligence officials say Mr. Nazir is known to harbor Arabs affiliated with Al Qaeda. The Haqqani network and fighters associated with it are also responsible for many of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and Afghan troops in eastern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struck a double-cabin pickup truck and a motorcycle as they returned from Afghanistan into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Pakistani military official said. Seven fighters were killed and six others were wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just south of the village of Angor Adda on the border between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It may have been for a very good reason and a quality target, but the politics of it look a little insensitive,'' said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer and the author of ''Deadly Embrace: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, America, and the Future of Global Jihad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an additional irritant to relations between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a federal court released statements on Tuesday by a Pakistani-American man named David Headley in which he says that he helped Lashkar-e-Taiba plot the 2008 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Mumbai with the support of top ISI officials. Mr. Headley's role in the Mumbai </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not only been a source of tension between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, but has also ignited outrage in India, where critics accuse the United States of allying itself with a government that they say knowingly colludes with terrorists. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long denied that the spy agency itself had anything to do with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and civilian leaders have privately supported the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a way to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants, particularly in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Army has conducted few if any operations. In the past two years, however, the C.I.A. has developed its own network of covert Pakistani sources to help identify targets for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and no longer relies on the ISI for that type of assistance, American officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials have grown more alarmed at the frequency of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- 117 last year, more than all previous years combined -- and the fact that the targets are now largely low-level fighters and junior commanders, not top operatives. Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bring this year's number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to 20, according to the Long War Journal, a Web site that tracks the wars in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On popular Pakistani television talk shows in the past several weeks, commentators have railed against the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in unusually strong language. Some have suggested that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should shoot at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to stop them, an extreme measure that more moderate voices have said could result in American retaliation. The leadership of the Pakistani military knew that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not be stopped by force, said Talat Masood, a retired lieutenant general and military analyst in Islamabad. ''The army knows it can't stop completely the main counterterrorism tool of the United States,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, as unpalatable as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are, the Pakistani Army does not want to see a possible alternative: American soldiers fighting against the militants on Pakistani territory, General Masood said. General Masood said that the most that Pakistanis could expect from the Americans was more limited use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some American experts on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, offered a counterexplanation to the Pakistani fury over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They say Pakistani protests may be part of a complicated political theater in which Pakistani officials angrily protest some affront to their sovereignty to whip up already fervent anti-Americanism in the country, and then use the tumult as leverage to extract concessions from the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Pakistanis are masterful at creating these imbroglios which become enormous domestic issues, which they then use to try to reset the relationship with the United States more on their terms,'' said Christine Fair, a political scientist at Georgetown University who has worked and traveled widely in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM -- Three members of the United Nations panel that investigated Israel's Gaza war two years ago rejected on Thursday an essay written by the fourth, the former chairman Richard Goldstone, in which he retracted the panel's key conclusions, especially that Israel had deliberately made civilians targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three -- Hina Jilani of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Desmond Travers of Ireland and Christine Chinkin of Britain -- issued a statement to The Guardian in London saying that any attempt to backtrack on their report amounted to yielding to outside pressure, and that doing so would deprive the victims of justice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although their statement did not refer directly to Mr. Goldstone's commentary in The Washington Post or to the issue of whether armed force was used intentionally against civilians, it was nonetheless a firm rebuke of Mr. Goldstone, and of efforts to reconsider and even nullify the report the panel submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2009. The report is headed for the Security Council and General Assembly this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In recent days some articles and comments appearing in the press with respect to the report of the United Nations (U.N.) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008-2009 have misrepresented facts in an attempt to delegitimize the findings of this report and to cast doubts on its credibility,'' their joint statement began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Members of the mission, signatories to this statement, find it necessary to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Goldstone said by e-mail that he declined to respond to his colleagues' statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Washington Post essay included this broad statement: ''If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he said that what his panel believed to be an intentional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a Palestinian family, gathered by Israeli troops into one building that was then bombed, now appeared to have been caused instead by the fog of war -- a misread </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> report that, he had noted elsewhere, showed men carrying firewood that may have looked like rockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Goldstone, who is Jewish and South African, said that Israeli military investigations, while slow and incomplete, were showing him that civilians were probably not targets. Meanwhile, he complained that Hamas had conducted no internal investigation of its firing of rockets at Israeli civilians, that it continued to launch such rockets and that the council should make a point of condemning those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, ''I had hoped that our inquiry into all aspects of the Gaza conflict would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest complaints that Israel and its backers had about the panel's original report was that it accused Israel of aiming to kill civilians and that it was too soft on Hamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by Mr. Goldstone's three colleagues shows that they share none of his second thoughts about the report and that they are eager to prevent his essay from being used to cast aside the report entirely, as the Israeli government and some members of Congress are hoping it will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Goldstone referred in his essay to a follow-up report by a panel led by a retired New York State judge, Mary McGowan Davis. His three colleagues refer to the same report but reach a very different conclusion. Mr. Goldstone notes that, according to the follow-up, Israel has begun 400 inquires into wrongdoing during the military campaign in Gaza, which it called Operation Cast Lead, and that much has been learned. His former colleagues say, by contrast, that of the 400 inquiries, 3 have yielded submissions for prosecution and 2 have led to someone being punished, in both cases with minor penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Therefore, the mechanisms that are being used by the Israeli authorities to investigate the incidents are proving inadequate to genuinely ascertain the facts and any ensuing legal responsibility,'' they write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In addition, with regard to the issue of the policies guiding Operation Cast Lead, the committee states that there is 'no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead.' In other words, one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of Israel's military operations remains completely unaddressed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three conclude by saying that pressure had been applied to all members of the panel but that, unlike Mr. Goldstone, they had not yielded to it. They say: ''Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitize our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The report has triggered a process that is still under way and should continue until justice is done and respect for international human rights and humanitarian law by everyone is ensured.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The differences between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that broke into the open last week over the scale of C.I.A. operations here signaled a fundamental rift, plunging the relationship, sometimes strained, sometimes warm, to its lowest point in memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rupture over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demands that the Americans end </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- which the Obama administration rejected -- and scale back their intelligence presence within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exposed the tentative nature of the alliance forged after the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is increasingly apparent that the two countries have differing, even irreconcilable, aims in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Afghan endgame looming, suspicion is overwhelming faint cooperation between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as each side seeks to secure its interests, increase its leverage to obtain them, and even cut out the other if need be, American and Pakistani officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or in Washington now speaks of returning to the strategic alliance made by President George W. Bush and Gen. Pervez Musharraf immediately after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when the primary goal was to operate joint intelligence efforts to capture operatives of Al Qaeda. Military officials from both sides say that arrangement was never bound to be a longstanding affair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There was never a level of trust,'' said a former American military official who served in a senior position in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''I'm convinced now they don't want our help.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American official did not want to be identified while discussing the delicate nature of a relationship that, whatever its failings, both nations are reluctant to jettison completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But politicians on both sides are disappointed with the results of billions of dollars in American military and civilian assistance since 2001, and the Obama administration acknowledged to Congress in a report this month that the results of the spending fell short of expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, the money has done little to pave over the accumulating strategic differences between the two nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadly, the Americans seek a strong and relatively centralized Afghan government commanding a large army that can control its territory. Almost all those ends are objectionable to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which while it calls for a stable Afghanistan, prefers a more loosely governed neighbor where it can influence events, if need be, through Taliban proxies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The particular differences revolve around which Taliban factions should be included in any settlement; the role of India, an ally of the United States but the enemy of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; and the size of the new Afghan Army, which the Americans want big and the Pakistanis want small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is further complicated, American and Pakistani officials said, by discord within the Obama administration over how the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan, and what role, if any, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should play in the exit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, is determined to batter the Taliban as much as possible, a policy that the Pakistanis disagree with, both sides say. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prefers that the State Department tilt toward reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even within the Pentagon, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, who has met with the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Afshaq Parvez Kayani, on more than two dozen occasions, has more tolerance for the Pakistani point of view than does General Petraeus, a senior American official said. With his position in Washington, Admiral Mullen could still prevail on persevering with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These American nuances are well known at the Pakistani Army headquarters in Rawalpindi, where General Petraeus is referred to as Mr. Petraeus -- a calculated omission of his military title as a way to mock his perceived political ambitions, according to a recent visitor to the headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> diplomats and military officials have complained that they were being kept in the dark by the Obama administration's maneuvering, no matter how preliminary, for a negotiated solution in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is no transparency; they are not telling us who they are talking to,'' a Pakistani government official said. Another official, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security apparatus, said: ''We don't know what the Americans' endgame is in Afghanistan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As their nervousness about American intentions have increased in recent months, the Pakistanis have sought to improve their leverage -- threatening C.I.A. operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, cracking down on Taliban leaders to coerce their cooperation, and trying to befriend President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who has also felt on the outs with Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest iteration of this new Pakistani-Afghan relationship, General Kayani and the head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence agency, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, accompanied Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on a visit to Kabul on Saturday, the most public of a number of visits to Afghanistan by General Kayani in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American diplomats in Islamabad and Kabul declined to comment on the Pakistani visit to Afghanistan, and appeared to know little about the intention of the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joint Commission unveiled with considerable fanfare by the two sides in Kabul as a vehicle to end the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some extent, the Americans have been coaxing the Afghan and Pakistani leadership to talk to each other, but not at the cost of keeping the United States out of the loop, or of concocting solutions that are against American interests, American officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistanis' efforts to improve relations with Mr. Karzai, whom until recently they had given the cold shoulder, was but the latest example of attempts to sidestep the United States in order to safeguard Pakistani interests in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistanis may well have scored an early gain with Mr. Karzai, reportedly persuading the Afghan president that a 400,000-strong Afghan Army favored by the Americans was unsustainable and should only number 100,000, a Pakistani familiar with General Kayani's thinking said. For their part, American officials say they are reluctant to include </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the early maneuverings on peace in Afghanistan because they are concerned that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will block concessions that the United States wants from the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the United States wants to keep pressure on the network led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, a longtime asset of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose fighters cross from North Waziristan into Afghanistan to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at American and NATO soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impression of the United States leaving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out in the cold is particularly disconcerting to General Kayani because he was granted a three-year extension on his term last July by his generals, partly on the grounds that he would win a seat for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Afghanistan negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nod to General Kayani, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the general on the sidelines of a conference in Munich in February and pledged that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be included in the negotiations, a Pakistani and an American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But distrust is carrying the day, as the dispute over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign showed. For some time, in fact, Pakistani security officials say, the Americans have refused to share information on their targets and have gathered intelligence on them on their own, using their own network of agents and informants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior American official in Washington acknowledged that in many instances the Pakistanis had been cut out because they were not trusted. In the past, targets had escaped from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after word of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was leaked. That would presumably be by the Pakistani side, which still favors a strategy of choosing between ''good'' Taliban, those who do </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bidding in Afghanistan, and ''bad,'' those who do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The feeling of being allies was never there,'' a senior Pakistani military officer, who has interacted closely with Washington since 2001, said. ''I've said to the Americans: 'You are going to fail in Afghanistan and you are going to make us the fall guy.' I still think this is going to happen.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO -- The government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi suffered setbacks on multiple fronts on Thursday as rebels in the western mountains seized a Tunisian border crossing, fighters in the besieged city of Misurata said they were gaining ground and President Obama authorized the use of armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for close-in fighting against the Qaddafi forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels in the Western mountains took control of a border crossing in the town of Wazen after an early morning battle that sent a small number of Libyan soldiers fleeing across the frontier, the official Tunisian news agency reported. The news agency said 13 of the Libyan soldiers, including a colonel and two commanders, had been detained, while a rebel spokesman in the eastern city of Benghazi asserted that more than 100 had sought asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fighting in the mountains has escalated over the last two weeks, United Nations aid workers say that more than 14,000 Libyan refugees -- many of them members of the Berber minority, which is prevalent in the area -- have fled across the same border, with as many as 6,000 a day crossing recently, a spokesman for the United Nations Human Rights Commission said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is unclear that the rebels can hold Wazen, their success is the first major crack in Colonel Qaddafi's control of the western region since he crushed the uprisings that broke out in Tripoli and many other cities and towns across Libya when the insurrection erupted two months ago. It opens the possibility of the rebels there importing aid or weapons and provides the first hint of a break in the stalemate that has settled over the Libyan civil war in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a move that seemed to be aimed at ending that deadlock, the Pentagon said Thursday that President Obama had authorized the use of armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Colonel Qaddafi's forces, which have partly evaded the airstrikes by intermingling with civilian populations and operating out of unmarked vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American military has used the Predator, a remotely piloted aircraft outfitted with Hellfire missiles, to hit targets in urban and rural areas in Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iraq and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the deployment, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates described the addition of armed Predators as ''a modest contribution'' to the NATO </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mission. But Mr. Obama's approval of their deployment seemed to be another sign of gaps in NATO's ability to carry out complicated, extended combat missions without continued and significant American support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those gaps have become more apparent since the United States transferred command of the Libya mission to NATO on April 4, when the American military stepped back to a supporting role. Despite that move, American planes have dropped significant numbers of bombs, more than any of the other countries in the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Misurata, the rebel-held port city where rebels have pleaded for weeks for such weaponry to beat back a siege by Qaddafi forces, a rebel spokesman said Thursday that recent airstrikes and aid shipments had enabled rebel fighters to take the offensive. The spokesman, Mohamed, whose full name was withheld for the protection of his family, said the rebels killed more than 100 Qaddafi soldiers on Thursday and 51 on Wednesday, when they also captured 40 others. ''People are celebrating in Misurata,'' he said, speaking over an Internet connection because most telephone service and electricity to the city was cut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other advances, he said the rebels had driven away snipers who had terrorized civilians along the city's central Tripoli Avenue. ''There is a pattern of collapse among the Qaddafi troops in and around Misurata,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the rebels' eastern stronghold of Benghazi, Col. Ahmed Bani, a spokesman for the rebel military, said anti-Qaddafi fighters had attacked the western border crossing at Wazen repeatedly in the past before succeeding on Thursday. ''This is a supply line linking us to Tunisia,'' he said, adding that the rebel forces in Wazen were communicating with the leadership in Benghazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, NATO airstrikes against the Qaddafi forces have enabled the rebels to retain control of Benghazi and a handful of eastern towns, the western commercial port of Misurata and, according to some reports, the western mountain towns of Nalut and Zintan. But the Qaddafi forces have maintained tight control of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and kept up a fierce siege on Misurata and the other rebel-held towns, and rebel leaders have complained bitterly about the relative paucity of NATO airstrikes in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most attention has focused on the major port cities of Benghazi and Misurata, the mountainous western region stretching from Wazen to nearby Nalut and Zintan has simmered with opposition to Qaddafi. The Berbers there have long chafed under the Qaddafi government, which has sought to deny their status as a culturally distinct minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After rebels took control of Benghazi on Feb. 20, residents of Nalut and Zintan joined others from Tripoli, Misurata, Zawiyah, Zawarah, Sabratha and other towns in taking to the streets to burn police stations and the headquarters of Colonel Qaddafi's local ''revolutionary committees.'' In the following weeks, however, his security forces re-established a firm grip on Tripoli and gradually recaptured most of the other towns as well, leaving Zintan and Misurata as the main western centers of resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said many fleeing to the camps described escalating clashes in the mountains around Zintan and Nalut over the last two weeks, as Qaddafi forces fired artillery toward the towns and the rebels lashed back. ''The western mountain region has been under siege for a month or so,'' Mr. Kayal said. ''What is clear is that they have fled because of the intensifying violence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a quarter of a million refugees have fled Libya into Tunisia over the last two months, he said. At the other main crossing near the Mediterranean, most of those fleeing were foreign workers, he said, but the 14,000 who have fled through Wazen have been Libyan families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deployment of the Predators follows weeks when rebels have complained of a lack of support from NATO after the United States handed over direction of the air campaign to NATO. In announcing the addition of the new weapon, Mr. Gates suggested that the United States was filling in a gap in the other arsenals of the other allies, who do not have similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The president has said that where we have some unique capabilities, he is willing to use those,'' Mr. Gates said at a Pentagon news conference, suggesting the Predators would provide ''some precision capability.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about military setbacks suffered a day earlier by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya misidentified the United Nations official who had described a flood of Libyan refugees into Tunisia. He is Firas Kayal, not Faras Kaya. The article also misstated the United Nations organization for which Mr. Kayal is the spokesman. It is the High Commissioner for Refugees, not the Human Rights Commission, an organization that no longer exists. (The Human Rights Council replaced the Human Rights Commission in 2006.)<BR></SPAN></P>
