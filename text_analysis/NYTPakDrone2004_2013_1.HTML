<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, June 18 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 27-year-old former Taliban fighter who recently embarrassed the Pakistani Army and became one of the country's best-known and most-wanted militants was killed in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday night, Pakistani military officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local residents said they believed that a missile fired from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed the militant, Nek Muhammad, after he spoke over a satellite phone. But Pakistani military officials denied any American involvement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, the chief spokesman for the Pakistani military, said Friday that Pakistani forces had been tracking Mr. Muhammad for several days. The general declined to say exactly how Mr. Muhammad was killed, but said Pakistani helicopters and artillery were both capable of striking a compound with pinpoint accuracy. He said reports of American involvement were ''absolutely absurd.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Sultan said the killing of Mr. Muhammad was a major victory in the government's campaign against terrorism. Government officials had accused Mr. Muhammad of sheltering foreign militants, and he appeared to toy with, and embarrass, the Pakistani Army during a series of negotiations this spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''This sends a good message,'' said General Sultan, who appeared visibly pleased with the news of Mr. Muhammad's death. ''The government is serious. The government means business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general said 60 to 70 militants, most of whom were believed to be Uzbeks, had been killed in recent fighting. About 20 Pakistani Army troops had also been killed, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An anonymous caller to a journalist for the British Broadcasting Corporation in Peshawar vowed retaliatory </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the government. Thousands of people attended Mr. Muhammad's funeral, which was held in his nearby hometown of Kaloosha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Taliban fighter, whose jet-black, shoulder-length hair and thick beard gave him the look of a revolutionary, had been in hiding since the Pakistani Army began an operation last week in the tribal areas, government officials said. Hundreds of foreign militants are believed to be hiding in the tribal areas and planning terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed 72 people in Karachi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest city, and raised new fears that militants are recruiting new members to directly challenge the army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Muhammad was a symbol of that defiance. He and his men were believed to have killed at least 60 soldiers and paramilitary scouts in April in battles near Wana. About 60 militants also died in the clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of hunting down Mr. Muhammad, as expected, the army opened negotiations with him. In late April, a Pakistani corps commander pardoned Mr. Muhammad and four other local tribesmen accused of sheltering militants in exchange for a promise that they would not carry out any more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within minutes of that agreement, Mr. Muhammad told Pakistani journalists he was still loyal to the Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, and would continue waging holy war. He also denied that there were any foreigners present in the tribal areas, or that he had agreed they would register with the government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just how Mr. Muhammad was killed remained unclear on Friday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses reported hearing what they believed was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the area minutes before the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed Mr. Muhammad. On Friday, an unidentified caller telephoned a Pakistani journalist with the BBC and complained that the journalists' satellite telephone conversations with Mr. Muhammad had disclosed his location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Residents said Mr. Muhammad was sitting in a courtyard with four other men eating dinner at 10 p.m. on Thursday when the missile struck. They said it hit the middle of where Mr. Muhammad and the men were sitting, leaving a crater 6 feet by 6 feet. All five men were killed.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GHAZNI, Afghanistan, July 19 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani Army, backed by United States intelligence and surveillance, has stepped up its operations against supporters of Al Qaeda in the area near the Afghan border in recent weeks, displacing thousands of Afghan refugees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 200,000 Afghan refugees have been living in the remote border areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in poor and insecure conditions. In the past few weeks, as the Pakistani operations in the tribal area of South Waziristan have risen in strength and, according to some reports, prompted a matching increase in militant resistance, 25,000 people have poured back into Afghanistan, refugee officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past five months, the Pakistani Army, at the behest of the United States, has pushed into the normally autonomous tribal areas, in an attempt to capture or kill an estimated 500 foreign fighters -- many of them hardened Uzbek and Central Asian militants -- and supporting tribesmen, and to search for Osama bin Laden and his Egyptian deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who are often rumored to be sheltering in the area. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States military, which has 17,000 troops across the border in Afghanistan, has provided satellite intelligence and aerial surveillance to assist Pakistani operations, the Pakistanis have said. Last month a Pakistani tribal leader was killed in what officials in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a Hellfire missile launched from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States say American troops have not moved into Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the fighting has increased, the Pakistani military has hardened its position against the Afghan refugees living in the area, officials in Afghanistan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees have been given as little as two hours' notice to leave before their houses were bulldozed, according to officials with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Some have returned to Afghanistan with no belongings, homeless once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pakistani authorities have acknowledged closing and bulldozing two refugee camps, Zarinoor 1 and Zarinoor 2, in South Waziristan. A Pakistani official in Kabul said the government had decided to dismantle all camps within about three miles of the border ''as part of a cleanup of the area, so militant-saboteurs would have no place for asylum.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Inevitably that caused hardship to families,'' he said. ''It's unfortunate, but it had to be done as part of the overall campaign against terrorism.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations and Afghan refugee officials have raised grave concerns about the refugee exodus with the Pakistani government, saying people being forced to leave should be given adequate warning to collect their belongings and some choice as to where to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New arrivals interviewed in the town of Ghazni, south of Kabul, said they had been given 72 hours to leave their houses as the military moved to clear their area. Others said they fled in general panic as the fighting intensified around their villages and refugee camps as recently as four days ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scale of the problem has only recently come to light after a nongovernmental organization, Tribal Liaison Office--Swisspeace, interviewed 1,500 families in Paktika, the province bordering South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization has estimated that nearly 4,000 families have taken shelter in Paktika Province alone. Afghan government officials say the total is nearer 5,000 families, with almost 200 more families arriving in Ghazni Province, and another 200 families in Baghlan Province, north of Kabul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations refugee officials have been unable to travel to Paktika but also use the figure of 24,000 to 25,000 people. Daniel Endres, acting head of the United Nations refugee office in Afghanistan, said their ejection from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> amounted to forcible repatriation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees interviewed in Ghazni said they had left homes not just on the border but also deep inside South Waziristan. One man called Afghan, 29, head of a family of nine, said people living in his Wachkala settlement, on the edge of the town of Wana, about 25 miles from the border, had been given 72 hours to evacuate their homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long-distance truck driver, he arrived home a day after the announcement was made in the mosque and scrambled to pack up after 18 years in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''When I saw everyone was leaving, I got very nervous and started planning to leave,'' he said. ''Four to six trucks were leaving every day.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With no home to go to in Afghanistan, he came to Ghazni, where his parents used to live. He and his family slept in his truck for three days before someone took them in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two brothers, Amir Muhammad, 50, and Khaori Muhammad, 55, left with 15 family members just a few days ago, abandoning their home in the village of Piba, near Wana, when fighting came so close that helicopters were hovering over the village and bullets were winging overhead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We were scared we would be killed in the fighting, so we came here,'' Amir Muhammad said. The family lived near a Pakistani Army base, and when militants fired on the base, the military threatened to destroy homes in the nearby village, he said. ''The government told us that if they came under fire from any place, they would destroy it,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were camping out in the ruins of their old house, destroyed more than 20 years ago in Soviet bombing raids. ''For four days we have been sitting in the open under the sun,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''We left everything behind; we just brought ourselves.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of another family that arrived three weeks ago, said their father had tried to stay on but had had to abandon the house three days ago after fighting came too close. Ghumcha Gul, 15, said they had seen helicopters pounding an area called Shakai, where there is a refugee camp and a militant training camp, and soldiers being dropped from Chinooks in the mountains above.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Richard A. Posner. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the execution was in one vital respect superb: the 9/11 commission report is an uncommonly lucid, even riveting, narrative of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> their background and the response to them. (Norton has published the authorized edition; another edition, including reprinted news articles by reporters from The New York Times, has been published by St. Martin's, while PublicAffairs has published the staff reports and some of the testimony.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prose is free from bureaucratese and, for a consensus statement, the report is remarkably forthright. Though there could not have been a single author, the style is uniform. The document is an improbable literary triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the commission's analysis and recommendations are unimpressive. The delay in the commission's getting up to speed was not its fault but that of the administration, which dragged its heels in turning over documents; yet with completion of its investigation deferred to the presidential election campaign season, the commission should have waited until after the election to release its report. That would have given it time to hone its analysis and advice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The enormous public relations effort that the commission orchestrated to win support for the report before it could be digested also invites criticism -- though it was effective: in a poll conducted just after publication, 61 percent of the respondents said the commission had done a good job, though probably none of them had read the report. The participation of the relatives of the terrorists' victims (described in the report as the commission's ''partners'') lends an unserious note to the project (as does the relentless self-promotion of several of the members). One can feel for the families' loss, but being a victim's relative doesn't qualify a person to advise on how the disaster might have been prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much more troublesome are the inclusion in the report of recommendations (rather than just investigative findings) and the commissioners' misplaced, though successful, quest for unanimity. Combining an investigation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with proposals for preventing future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the same mistake as combining intelligence with policy. The way a problem is described is bound to influence the choice of how to solve it. The commission's contention that our intelligence structure is unsound predisposed it to blame the structure for the failure to prevent the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whether it did or not. And pressure for unanimity encourages just the kind of herd thinking now being blamed for that other recent intelligence failure -- the belief that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least the commission was consistent. It believes in centralizing intelligence, and people who prefer centralized, pyramidal governance structures to diversity and competition deprecate dissent. But insistence on unanimity, like central planning, deprives decision makers of a full range of alternatives. For all one knows, the price of unanimity was adopting recommendations that were the second choice of many of the commission's members or were consequences of horse trading. The premium placed on unanimity undermines the commission's conclusion that everybody in sight was to blame for the failure to prevent the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given its political composition (and it is evident from the questioning of witnesses by the members that they had not forgotten which political party they belong to), the commission could not have achieved unanimity without apportioning equal blame to the Clinton and Bush administrations, whatever the members actually believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tale of how we were surprised by the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a product of hindsight; it could not be otherwise. And with the aid of hindsight it is easy to identify missed opportunities (though fewer than had been suspected) to have prevented the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and tempting to leap from that observation to the conclusion that the failure to prevent them was the result not of bad luck, the enemy's skill and ingenuity or the difficulty of defending against suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or protecting an almost infinite array of potential targets, but of systemic failures in the nation's intelligence and security apparatus that can be corrected by changing the apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the leap the commission makes, and it is not sustained by the report's narrative. The narrative points to something different, banal and deeply disturbing: that it is almost impossible to take effective action to prevent something that hasn't occurred previously. Once the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did occur, measures were taken that have reduced the likelihood of a recurrence. But before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was psychologically and politically impossible to take those measures. The government knew that Al Qaeda had attacked United States facilities and would do so again. But the idea that it would do so by infiltrating operatives into this country to learn to fly commercial aircraft and then crash such aircraft into buildings was so grotesque that anyone who had proposed that we take costly measures to prevent such an event would have been considered a candidate for commitment. No terrorist had hijacked an American commercial aircraft anywhere in the world since 1986. Just months before the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the director of the Defense Department's Defense Threat Reduction Agency wrote: ''We have, in fact, solved a terrorist problem in the last 25 years. We have solved it so successfully that we have forgotten about it; and that is a treat. The problem was aircraft hijacking and bombing. We solved the problem. . . . The system is not perfect, but it is good enough. . . . We have pretty much nailed this thing.'' In such a climate of thought, efforts to beef up airline security not only would have seemed gratuitous but would have been greatly resented because of the cost and the increased airport congestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem isn't just that people find it extraordinarily difficult to take novel risks seriously; it is also that there is no way the government can survey the entire range of possible disasters and act to prevent each and every one of them. As the commission observes, ''Historically, decisive security action took place only after a disaster had occurred or a specific plot had been discovered.'' It has always been thus, and probably always will be. For example, as the report explains, the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center led to extensive safety improvements that markedly reduced the toll from the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in other words, only to the slight extent that the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a precedent were significant defensive steps taken in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission's contention that ''the terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government'' is overblown. By the mid-1990's the government knew that Osama bin Laden was a dangerous enemy of the United States. President Clinton and his national security adviser, Samuel Berger, were so concerned that Clinton, though ''warned in the strongest terms'' by the Secret Service and the C.I.A. that ''visiting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would risk the president's life,'' did visit that country (flying in on an unmarked plane, using decoys and remaining only six hours) and tried unsuccessfully to enlist its cooperation against bin Laden. Clinton authorized the assassination of bin Laden, and a variety of means were considered for achieving this goal, but none seemed feasible. Invading Afghanistan to pre-empt future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Al Qaeda was considered but rejected for diplomatic reasons, which President Bush accepted when he took office and which look even more compelling after the trouble we've gotten into with our pre-emptive invasion of Iraq. The complaint that Clinton was merely ''swatting at flies,'' and the claim that Bush from the start was determined to destroy Al Qaeda root and branch, are belied by the commission's report. The Clinton administration envisaged a campaign of attrition that would last three to five years, the Bush administration a similar campaign that would last three years. With an invasion of Afghanistan impracticable, nothing better was on offer. Almost four years after Bush took office and almost three years after we wrested control of Afghanistan from the Taliban, Al Qaeda still has not been destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems that by the time Bush took office, ''bin Laden fatigue'' had set in; no one had practical suggestions for eliminating or even substantially weakening Al Qaeda. The commission's statement that Clinton and Bush had been offered only a ''narrow and unimaginative menu of options for action'' is hindsight wisdom at its most fatuous. The options considered were varied and imaginative; they included enlisting the Afghan Northern Alliance or other potential tribal allies of the United States to help kill or capture bin Laden, an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by our Special Operations forces on his compound, assassinating him by means of a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft or coercing or bribing the Taliban to extradite him. But for political or operational reasons, none was feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It thus is not surprising, perhaps not even a fair criticism, that the new administration treaded water until the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that's what it did. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, ''demoted'' Richard Clarke, the government's leading bin Laden hawk and foremost expert on Al Qaeda. It wasn't technically a demotion, but merely a decision to exclude him from meetings of the cabinet-level ''principals committee'' of the National Security Council; he took it hard, however, and requested a transfer from the bin Laden beat to cyberterrorism. The committee did not discuss Al Qaeda until a week before the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new administration showed little interest in exploring military options for dealing with Al Qaeda, and Donald Rumsfeld had not even gotten around to appointing a successor to the Defense Department's chief counterterrorism official (who had left the government in January) when the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I suspect that one reason, not mentioned by the commission, for the Bush administration's initially tepid response to the threat posed by Al Qaeda is that a new administration is predisposed to reject the priorities set by the one it's succeeding. No doubt the same would have been true had Clinton been succeeding Bush as president rather than vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the commission's report was published, the impression was widespread that the failure to prevent the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been due to a failure to collate bits of information possessed by different people in our security services, mainly the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And, indeed, had all these bits been collated, there would have been a chance of preventing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though only a slight one; the best bits were not obtained until late in August 2001, and it is unrealistic to suppose they could have been integrated and understood in time to detect the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The narrative portion of the report ends at Page 338 and is followed by 90 pages of analysis and recommendations. I paused at Page 338 and asked myself what improvements in our defenses against terrorist groups like Al Qaeda are implied by the commission's investigative findings (as distinct from recommendations that the commission goes on to make in the last part of the report). The list is short:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) Major buildings should have detailed evacuation plans and the plans should be communicated to the occupants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) Customs officers should be alert for altered travel documents of Muslims entering the United States; some of the 9/11 hijackers might have been excluded by more careful inspections of their papers. Biometric screening (such as fingerprinting) should be instituted to facilitate the creation of a comprehensive database of suspicious characters. In short, our borders should be made less porous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) Airline passengers and baggage should be screened carefully, cockpit doors secured and override mechanisms installed in airliners to enable a hijacked plane to be controlled from the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4) Any legal barriers to sharing information between the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. should be eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (5) More Americans should be trained in Arabic, Farsi and other languages in widespread use in the Muslim world. The commission remarks that in 2002, only six students received undergraduate degrees in Arabic from colleges in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (6) The thousands of federal agents assigned to the ''war on drugs,'' a war that is not only unwinnable but probably not worth winning, should be reassigned to the war on international terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (7) The F.B.I. appears from the report to be incompetent to combat terrorism; this is the one area in which a structural reform seems indicated (though not recommended by the commission). The bureau, in excessive reaction to J. Edgar Hoover's freewheeling ways, has become afflicted with a legalistic mind-set that hinders its officials from thinking in preventive rather than prosecutorial terms and predisposes them to devote greater resources to drug and other conventional criminal investigations than to antiterrorist activities. The bureau is habituated to the leisurely time scale of criminal investigations and prosecutions. Information sharing within the F.B.I., let alone with other agencies, is sluggish, in part because the bureau's field offices have excessive autonomy and in part because the agency is mysteriously unable to adopt a modern communications system. The F.B.I. is an excellent police department, but that is all it is. Of all the agencies involved in intelligence and counterterrorism, the F.B.I. comes out worst in the commission's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress has been made on a number of items on my list. There have been significant improvements in border control and aircraft safety. The information ''wall'' was removed by the USA Patriot Act, passed shortly after 9/11, although legislation may not have been necessary, since, as the commission points out, before 9/11 the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. exaggerated the degree to which they were forbidden to share information. This was a managerial failure, not an institutional one. Efforts are under way on (5) and (6), though powerful political forces limit progress on (6). Oddly, the simplest reform -- better building-evacuation planning -- has lagged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only interesting item on my list is (7). The F.B.I.'s counterterrorism performance before 9/11 was dismal indeed. Urged by one of its field offices to seek a warrant to search the laptop of Zacarias Moussaoui (a candidate hijacker-pilot), F.B.I. headquarters refused because it thought the special court that authorizes foreign intelligence surveillance would decline to issue a warrant -- a poor reason for not requesting one. A prescient report from the Arizona field office on flight training by Muslims was ignored by headquarters. There were only two analysts on the bin Laden beat in the entire bureau. A notice by the director, Louis J. Freeh, that the bureau focus its efforts on counterterrorism was ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what to do? One possibility would be to appoint as director a hard-nosed, thick-skinned manager with a clear mandate for change -- someone of Donald Rumsfeld's caliber. (His judgment on Iraq has been questioned, but no one questions his capacity to reform a hidebound government bureaucracy.) Another would be to acknowledge the F.B.I.'s deep-rooted incapacity to deal effectively with terrorism, and create a separate domestic intelligence agency on the model of Britain's Security Service (M.I.5). The Security Service has no power of arrest. That power is lodged in the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, and if we had our own domestic intelligence service, modeled on M.I.5, the power of arrest would be lodged in a branch of the F.B.I. As far as I know, M.I.5 and M.I.6 (Britain's counterpart to the C.I.A.) work well together. They have a common culture, as the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. do not. They are intelligence agencies, operating by surveillance rather than by prosecution. Critics who say that an American equivalent of M.I.5 would be a Gestapo understand neither M.I.5 nor the Gestapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which brings me to another failing of the 9/11 commission: American provinciality. Just as we are handicapped in dealing with Islamist terrorism by our ignorance of the languages, cultures and history of the Muslim world, so we are handicapped in devising effective antiterrorist methods by our reluctance to consider foreign models. We shouldn't be embarrassed to borrow good ideas from nations with a longer experience of terrorism than our own. The blows we have struck against Al Qaeda's centralized organization may deflect Islamist terrorists from spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like 9/11 to retail forms like car and truck bombings, assassinations and sabotage. If so, Islamist terrorism may come to resemble the kinds of terrorism practiced by the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, with which foreign nations like Britain and Israel have extensive experience. The United States remains readily penetrable by Islamist terrorists who don't even look or sound Middle Eastern, and there are Qaeda sleeper cells in this country. All this underscores the need for a domestic intelligence agency that, unlike the F.B.I., is effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Were all the steps that I have listed fully implemented, the probability of another terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the scale of 9/11 would be reduced -- slightly. The measures adopted already, combined with our operation in Afghanistan, have undoubtedly reduced that probability, and the room for further reduction probably is small. We and other nations have been victims of surprise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before; we will be again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They follow a pattern. Think of Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the Tet offensive in Vietnam in 1968. It was known that the Japanese might </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> us. But that they would send their carrier fleet thousands of miles to Hawaii, rather than just </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the nearby Philippines or the British and Dutch possessions in Southeast Asia, was too novel and audacious a prospect to be taken seriously. In 1968 the Vietnamese Communists were known to be capable of attacking South Vietnam's cities. Indeed, such an assault was anticipated, though not during Tet (the Communists had previously observed a truce during the Tet festivities) and not on the scale it attained. In both cases the strength and determination of the enemy were underestimated, along with the direction of his main effort. In 2001 an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Al Qaeda was anticipated, but it was anticipated to occur overseas, and the capability and audacity of the enemy were underestimated. (Note in all three cases a tendency to underestimate non-Western foes -- another aspect of provinciality.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyone who thinks this pattern can be changed should read those 90 pages of analysis and recommendations that conclude the commission's report; they come to very little. Even the prose sags, as the reader is treated to a barrage of bromides: ''the American people are entitled to expect their government to do its very best,'' or ''we should reach out, listen to and work with other countries that can help'' and ''be generous and caring to our neighbors,'' or we should supply the Middle East with ''programs to bridge the digital divide and increase Internet access'' -- the last an ironic suggestion, given that encrypted e-mail is an effective medium of clandestine communication. The ''hearts and minds'' campaign urged by the commission is no more likely to succeed in the vast Muslim world today than its prototype was in South Vietnam in the 1960's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission wants criteria to be developed for picking out which American cities are at greatest risk of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and defensive resources allocated accordingly -- this to prevent every city from claiming a proportional share of those resources when it is apparent that New York and Washington are most at risk. Not only do we lack the information needed to establish such criteria, but to make Washington and New York impregnable so that terrorists can blow up Los Angeles or, for that matter, Kalamazoo with impunity wouldn't do us any good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report states that the focus of our antiterrorist strategy should not be ''just 'terrorism,' some generic evil. This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat at this moment in history is more specific. It is the threat posed by Islamist terrorism.'' Is it? Who knows? The menace of bin Laden was not widely recognized until just a few years before the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all anyone knows, a terrorist threat unrelated to Islam is brewing somewhere (maybe right here at home -- remember the Oklahoma City bombers and the Unabomber and the anthrax </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of October 2001) that, given the breathtakingly rapid advances in the technology of destruction, will a few years hence pose a greater danger than Islamic extremism. But if we listen to the 9/11 commission, we won't be looking out for it because we've been told that Islamist terrorism is the thing to concentrate on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illustrating the psychological and political difficulty of taking novel threats seriously, the commission's recommendations are implicitly concerned with preventing a more or less exact replay of 9/11. Apart from a few sentences on the possibility of nuclear terrorism, and of threats to other modes of transportation besides airplanes, the broader range of potential threats, notably those of bioterrorism and cyberterrorism, is ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the commission's specific recommendations are sensible, such as that American citizens should be required to carry biometric passports. But most are in the nature of more of the same -- more of the same measures that were implemented in the wake of 9/11 and that are being refined, albeit at the usual bureaucratic snail's pace. If the report can put spurs to these efforts, all power to it. One excellent recommendation is reducing the number of Congressional committees, at present in the dozens, that have oversight responsibilities with regard to intelligence. The stated reason for the recommendation is that the reduction will improve oversight. A better reason is that with so many committees exercising oversight, our senior intelligence and national security officials spend too much of their time testifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report's main proposal -- the one that has received the most emphasis from the commissioners and has already been endorsed in some version by both presidential candidates -- is for the appointment of a national intelligence director who would knock heads together in an effort to overcome the reluctance of the various intelligence agencies to share information. Yet the report itself undermines this proposal, in a section titled ''The Millennium Exception.'' ''In the period between December 1999 and early January 2000,'' we read, ''information about terrorism flowed widely and abundantly.'' Why? Mainly ''because everyone was already on edge with the millennium and possible computer programming glitches ('Y2K').'' Well, everyone is now on edge because of 9/11. Indeed, the report suggests no current impediments to the flow of information within and among intelligence agencies concerning Islamist terrorism. So sharing is not such a problem after all. And since the tendency of a national intelligence director would be to focus on the intelligence problem du jour, in this case Islamist terrorism, centralization of the intelligence function could well lead to overconcentration on a single risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission thinks the reason the bits of information that might have been assembled into a mosaic spelling 9/11 never came together in one place is that no one person was in charge of intelligence. That is not the reason. The reason or, rather, the reasons are, first, that the volume of information is so vast that even with the continued rapid advances in data processing it cannot be collected, stored, retrieved and analyzed in a single database or even network of linked databases. Second, legitimate security concerns limit the degree to which confidential information can safely be shared, especially given the ever-present threat of moles like the infamous Aldrich Ames. And third, the different intelligence services and the subunits of each service tend, because information is power, to hoard it. Efforts to centralize the intelligence function are likely to lengthen the time it takes for intelligence analyses to reach the president, reduce diversity and competition in the gathering and analysis of intelligence data, limit the number of threats given serious consideration and deprive the president of a range of alternative interpretations of ambiguous and incomplete data -- and intelligence data will usually be ambiguous and incomplete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal begins to seem almost absurd when one considers the variety of our intelligence services. One of them is concerned with designing and launching spy satellites; another is the domestic intelligence branch of the F.B.I.; others collect military intelligence for use in our conflicts with state actors like North Korea. There are 15 in all. The national intelligence director would be in continuous conflict with the attorney general, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of homeland security and the president's national security adviser. He would have no time to supervise the organizational reforms that the commission deems urgent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report bolsters its proposal with the claim that our intelligence apparatus was designed for fighting the cold war and so can't be expected to be adequate to fighting Islamist terrorism. The cold war is depicted as a conventional military face-off between the United States and the Soviet Union and hence a 20th-century relic (the 21st century is to be different, as if the calendar drove history). That is not an accurate description. The Soviet Union operated against the United States and our allies mainly through subversion and sponsored insurgency, and it is not obvious why the apparatus developed to deal with that conduct should be thought maladapted for dealing with our new enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report notes the success of efforts to centralize command of the armed forces, and to reduce the lethal rivalries among the military services. But there is no suggestion that the national intelligence director is to have command authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central-planning bent of the commission is nowhere better illustrated than by its proposal to shift the C.I.A.'s paramilitary operations, despite their striking success in the Afghanistan campaign, to the Defense Department. The report points out that ''the C.I.A. has a reputation for agility in operations,'' whereas the reputation of the military </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is ''for being methodical and cumbersome.'' Rather than conclude that we are lucky to have both types of fighting capacity, the report disparages ''redundant, overlapping capabilities'' and urges that ''the C.I.A.'s experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises and planning.'' The effect of such integration is likely to be the loss of the ''agility in operations'' that is the C.I.A.'s hallmark. The claim that we ''cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations'' makes no sense. It is not a question of building; we already have multiple such capabilities -- Delta Force, Marine reconnaissance teams, Navy Seals, Army Rangers, the C.I.A.'s Special Activities Division. Diversity of methods, personnel and organizational culture is a strength in a system of national security; it reduces risk and enhances flexibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is true is that 15 agencies engaged in intelligence activities require coordination, notably in budgetary allocations, to make sure that all bases are covered. Since the Defense Department accounts for more than 80 percent of the nation's overall intelligence budget, the C.I.A., with its relatively small budget (12 percent of the total), cannot be expected to control the entire national intelligence budget. But to layer another official on top of the director of central intelligence, one who would be in a constant turf war with the secretary of defense, is not an appealing solution. Since all executive power emanates from the White House, the national security adviser and his or her staff should be able to do the necessary coordinating of the intelligence agencies. That is the traditional pattern, and it is unlikely to be bettered by a radically new table of organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the report ends on a flat note. But one can sympathize with the commission's problem. To conclude after a protracted, expensive and much ballyhooed investigation that there is really rather little that can be done to reduce the likelihood of future terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond what is being done already, at least if the focus is on the sort of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have occurred in the past rather than on the newer threats of bioterrorism and cyberterrorism, would be a real downer -- even a tad un-American. Americans are not fatalists. When a person dies at the age of 95, his family is apt to ascribe his death to a medical failure. When the nation experiences a surprise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our instinctive reaction is not that we were surprised by a clever adversary but that we had the wrong strategies or structure and let's change them and then we'll be safe. Actually, the strategies and structure weren't so bad; they've been improved; further improvements are likely to have only a marginal effect; and greater dangers may be gathering of which we are unaware and haven't a clue as to how to prevent.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the major winners of America's war on terrorism has been nuclear-bound, terrorism-supporting Iran, and it is giving the Israelis nightmares. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israelis have been targets of terrorists since long before American cities were struck three years ago -- a fact driven home last week by bombings that killed dozens of vacationing Israelis at three resorts in Egypt. But the nightmares about Iran are of another dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran -- large, ambitious and run by radical clerics committed to the destruction of the Jewish state -- is seen by Israelis as the most obvious and urgent threat today to Israel's very existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan eliminated one of Iran's main fundamentalist rivals to its east, while the overthrow of Saddam Hussein to its west eliminated Iran's main military rival in the Persian Gulf. Not only is Mr. Hussein gone, but much of Iraq is in disorder, presenting opportunities for Iran to meddle in Iraq's heavily Shiite south, even to create a kind of Iranistan there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the Israelis who plan for this country's security confront a paradox: While they are relieved that the American invasion of Iraq removed a sworn enemy, they are increasingly nervous about the opportunities that the same invasion has opened for another. And they see the Middle East moving from conventional military rivalries to far more dangerous nuclear rivalries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why Israeli officials have been threatening for months to take ''the necessary steps,'' as Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz puts it, to prevent Iran, his birthplace, from developing nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind that threat is a hope that the rest of the world can persuade Iran, with threats and diplomacy, to drop the parts of its nuclear program that could be used for armaments. But Israeli officials say they have not had great success so far in encouraging a preoccupied Washington, a conflicted Russia and a divided Europe to do much about Iran except talk anxiously about it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's program -- which its leaders maintain is for peaceful purposes -- is far more sophisticated and widespread than the single Iraqi nuclear reactor Israel bombed in 1981, and Israeli officials make clear that they do not want to act alone against Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran, however, has an increasing number of cards to play in the region. According to the Israeli military, it has strong influence over the radical Palestinian group Hamas and over the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, which has been financing and organizing most of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Israelis from the Palestinian West Bank. Iran is gaining influence with the Shia factions jockeying for power in southern Iraq. Officials in Washington have said Iran is helping to foment anti-American resistance there. Most important, perhaps, Iran has increasingly sophisticated Shahab missiles that could hit the outskirts of Tel Aviv.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's leaders do not acknowledge ambitions for nuclear arms, but they are building reactors and there is logic for them wanting a bomb: their neighbors India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have nuclear arms, Israel is presumed to have them, and American troops are on their borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yuval Steinitz, chairman of the Israeli Parliament's foreign and defense committee, argues that Iran is a clear danger for the entire West, since it is working on an intercontinental missile that could threaten Europe and NATO. ''The Iran nuclear program is so ambitious that after producing a first bomb, they could produce 20 bombs a year,'' he said. ''It's up to the Americans and Europeans to solve Iran,'' he added, ''not little Israel.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Steinitz's concerns are expressed as well by senior Israeli political, military and intelligence officials who spoke on the condition that they not be quoted by name. Israel has been pushing Washington to deal with Iran's nuclear program since the mid-1990's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''If Iran develops nuclear weapons, there will be a new Middle East,'' said Gerald M. Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University. ''It would lead to a lot more brinkmanship and tension, with higher stakes for Israel's survival and pressure on other countries, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, to develop nuclear weapons of their own.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amatzia Baram, a scholar of Iraq, thinks Israel and the region are safer for now with Mr. Hussein gone. But the euphoria Israelis felt following his quick defeat has dissipated, Mr. Baram says, and has been replaced by anxiety over the possibility of American failure in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''So far, with the American Army in Iraq, things are O.K., if not very stable, and in the best case, Iraq will settle down, a net gain for Israel,'' said Mr. Baram, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Haifa University. ''But worst case, the Americans decide to go,'' he said, and that would mean: ''There's no central control, growing anarchy, western Iraq becomes a no man's land, like a little Afghanistan. Iran will be a power broker in southern Iraq, and then Jordan is under threat and there's more terrorism in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The jury's still out'' on what will happen, he said, ''and the stakes are very high.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's nuclear ambitions began under Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi in the 1970's, a time when the United States, France and Germany competed to build reactors there and Iran and Israel were proto-allies against a hostile Arab world. But the shah's overthrow in an Islamic revolution in 1979 changed the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israel later watched with some relief as Mr. Hussein's Iraq fought a war with Iran at such a bloody cost that both countries were weakened for years. But both regimes survived, with their animosity intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the short run, Israel has gained enormously from the ouster of Mr. Hussein, said Michael B. Oren, a historian and senior fellow at Jerusalem's Shalem Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only did Mr. Hussein sent $25,000 checks to the families of suicide bombers and promise to wipe Israel off the map, but his huge if indifferent army was the focus of the old Israeli specter of a massed invasion by Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi armies moving together against Israel's narrow waist. ''That was our nightmare, and it's over, buried,'' Mr. Oren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the long run, the situation in Iraq ''is very uncertain, hazardous and possibly catastrophic,'' he said. Even an American success in democratizing Iraq ''will almost definitely entail majority Shia rule, linked to a rapidly nuclearizing Iran, causing upheaval and increased expectations among Shias throughout the Gulf.'' He imagines a Shiite belt from the Persian Gulf through southern Lebanon, organized against America and Israel. ''That's scary, because the raison d'etre of the Iranian regime is to export holy war,'' he said. Also, Mr. Oren said, ''there's a genuine fear here that if America withdraws precipitously from Iraq, the initial message, that the West will stand up to terror, is not only lost, but supplanted by: 'You shoot at Americans and Westerners long enough and they'll retreat, so don't stop shooting.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Dan Schueftan, a senior fellow at the National Security Studies Center at Haifa University and at the Shalem Center, the situation is deeply worrisome, but not yet a crisis. Mr. Hussein's fall, he said, has been a clear benefit to Israel, which would have had Iran as an enemy in any case. The improbability of a big land war means that Israel's army can start renovating itself in earnest -- mothballing armor, cutting its size and acquiring high technology like precision weapons, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and anti-missile defenses that will help deter Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IRAN presents a global problem ''already recognized by the United States and Europe, which is within missile range,'' Mr. Schueftan said. ''So we feel less lonely vis-a-vis Iran than we did with Iraq in the 80's.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, he said, he worries about what Iran could do with nuclear weapons, and their impact on the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nuclear Iran would embolden Syria and Hezbollah to feel protected by an Iranian nuclear umbrella, he suggested. Egypt and other Arab countries would feel pressure to develop nuclear weapons, and other radical regimes could come into being. Egypt is under pressure from Islamic radicals. A change there, he said, ''would change the region completely.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Baram also makes the point that Iran's regime is less secure internally and more unpredictable than the Soviet regime that the United States faced in the cold war. ''In Iran, I can imagine some commander, acting out of ideology, like some Dr. Strangelove, shooting off a nuclear bomb against Israel,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There would be deterrence of a kind between Iran and Israel, he conceded, based on the old theory of mutually assured destruction, or MAD. ''But then everything hangs on MAD, and MAD in an area that is mad enough is a big problem,'' he said. ''And an existential one.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunting for Osama bin Laden, the C.I.A. established a series of small, covert bases in the rugged mountain frontier of northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in late 2003. Mr. bin Laden, the terrorist leader, was being sheltered there by local tribesmen and foreign militants, the agency had concluded, and controlled a group of handpicked operatives dedicated to attacking the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But since the bases opened, the C.I.A. officers stationed there have been strictly supervised by Pakistani officials, who have limited their ability to operate and have escorted them wherever they travel in the Pakistani border region. As a result, it has been virtually impossible for the Americans to gather intelligence effectively, say several officials familiar with the operation who would only speak anonymously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than three years after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Pentagon and New York transformed Osama bin Laden into the most wanted man in the world, the search for him remains stalled, frustrated by the remote topography of his likely Pakistani sanctuary, stymied by a Qaeda network that remains well financed and disciplined, sidetracked by the distractions of the Iraq war, and, perhaps most significantly, limited by deep suspicion of the United States among Pakistanis. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prodded by the United States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began an offensive along its northwest border this spring to flush out forces of Al Qaeda that had escaped from Afghanistan and to help find Mr. bin Laden. But after suffering heavy casualties and causing civilian deaths that stirred opposition, the Pakistani Army declared victory two weeks ago and announced that Mr. Bin Laden was not in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Many American intelligence officials are confident that he is, however -- and that he is as dangerous as ever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The war in Afghanistan inflicted severe damage on Al Qaeda, forcing it to adapt to survive, intelligence specialists agree. Today, they say it functions largely as a loose network of local franchises linked by a militant Islamist ideology. But Mr. bin Laden remains much more than just an iconic figurehead of Islamic militancy, most American intelligence officials now say. From a presumed hiding place on the Pakistani side of the Afghan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, he controls an elite terrorist cell devoted to attacking in the United States, the officials say they suspect. They contend that he personally oversees the group of Qaeda operatives, which he hopes to use for another ''spectacular'' event, like the Sept. 11 hijacking plot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American counterterrorism analysts say this special Qaeda unit is probably dispersed, though they do not know where. This ''external planning group'' can communicate with regional affiliates around the world to work with them when needed, one senior intelligence official said. ''There is a strong desire by bin Laden to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the continental United States, and he wants to use the external planning node to do it,'' the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the United States has failed to penetrate the group and has no idea when or where it will try to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the officials acknowledged. Intelligence officials would not provide any details of how they reached their conclusions about Mr. bin Laden's current role, which have not previously been reported.<BR><BR>Protective Network<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many analysts are convinced that he is being protected by a well-financed network of Pakistani tribesmen and foreign militants who operate in the impoverished border region, and that they have helped him communicate with major figures in his network. ''Bin Laden is getting his logistical support from the tribes,'' said one intelligence official. ''He still has operational communications with the outside.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The place suspected of being Mr. bin Laden's hide-out, in the shadow of the Hindu Kush mountain range, is in one of the most isolated and backward corners of the world. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> frontier is a barren terrain of mountains and mud. The fiercely independent ethnic Pashtun who inhabit the region are farmers and smugglers, most of them poor and illiterate. Local mullahs preach a radical Islamic ideology that portrays the United States as bent on enslaving Muslims and destroying their culture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sympathetic to the Taliban, many of whom attended madrasas, or religious schools, in the region, militant young tribesmen perceive American soldiers as dangerous aggressors who have occupied Afghanistan and Iraq and they view Mr. bin Laden as an avenging hero. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prohibits Western reporters from entering the area without a military escort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The seven semiautonomous tribal areas in the region have been a virtual no man's land for American forces since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> making them a natural haven for Qaeda figures who fled Afghanistan after the battle of Tora Bora in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not permit American military and intelligence forces in Afghanistan to cross the border to go after militants. This prohibition on cross-border ''hot pursuit'' makes it relatively easy for Taliban and Qaeda fighters to initiate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American bases in Afghanistan, and then quickly escape to the safety of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. American soldiers have complained about being fired on from inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by foreign militants while Pakistani border guards sat and watched.<BR><BR>Has Hot Pursuit Cooled?<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result of the restrictions, American military and intelligence personnel in Afghanistan are no longer really hunting for Mr. bin Laden, an intelligence official said. They are trying to provide stability for Afghanistan's new government while battling a local Taliban insurgency and a scattering of Qaeda fighters. On Saturday, the United States military began an offensive in Afghanistan to pursue those militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the United States conducts some air operations over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they are tightly controlled. Unmanned Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are authorized to fly over Pakistani airspace, but only with approval from the Pakistani military chain of command, frequently leading to costly delays, C.I.A. officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Electronic surveillance of the border region by the National Security Agency has proved frustrating as well, American intelligence officials say. Mr. bin Laden is believed to avoid using any electronic devices that could be monitored, and probably communicates only through trusted couriers, American intelligence officials say. Without cellphone towers along the frontier, satellite phones and push-to-talk radios are widely used often by drug smugglers, making it difficult to zero in on Qaeda operatives using the same kind of equipment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hoping to collect more intelligence, the C.I.A. opened secret bases with small numbers of operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in late 2003, but it has been unable to use them for aggressive counterterrorism operations, intelligence officials say. The operatives, many of whom are C.I.A. paramilitary officers, depended on Pakistani Army commanders, whose views on cooperation with the C.I.A. vary widely, American officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are real limits on our movement'' inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said one American official, and it has deeply frustrated intelligence officers. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to discuss any aspect of the clandestine bases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said that the Americans were instantly identifiable and unlikely to succeed working alone. They say the Americans are escorted to prevent them from being kidnapped or killed, or their presence exposed, which would be damaging to the Pakistani government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision to allow the bases is one of President Pervez Musharraf's most significant steps to help the United States, intelligence officials say. He is trying to balance his alliance with the United States with his need to avoid setting off a broader insurgency in the border region, where the central government is resented for its long neglect. Government officials said that some militants from other parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have gone to the tribal areas to join the fight.<BR><BR>Reluctant Allies<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the Americans had pressed the Pakistanis to search for Qaeda forces since late 2001, the military campaign was begun only after two assassination attempts against General Musharraf in December 2003 were traced back to the tribal areas. Before that, Pakistani officials had stated that there were no foreign militants in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army eventually deployed 25,000 troops in South Waziristan, one of the tribal areas, and found several terrorist training camps. In October, Pakistani commanders said they had killed 246 militants and captured 579. The raids and sweeps had a heavy cost. About 200 Pakistani soldiers were killed, and tribal members said hundreds of civilians had died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sept. 9, for example, an air raid near the village of Dela in South Waziristan killed as many as 80 civilians. Young men from the Mehsud tribe, many of whose members died in the incident, began flocking to the militants. ''That was a turning point,'' said Rahimullan Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist. ''Their friends, their relatives and people they knew were killed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No precise numbers exist, but Pakistani officials estimated that 500 to 1,000 of the tribesmen were fighting beside 150 to 300 foreign militants, most of them Uzbeks. Pakistani analysts say the area's tribal structure is fraying. Drawn by the wealth, sense of belonging and promise of paradise that the militants offer, unemployed young tribesmen are openly defying edicts from tribal leaders and taking up arms, Mr. Yusufzai said. ''These young men refuse to listen to their elders, to their families,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local residents have said that they were caught between the army and the militants. Nisar Wazir, 56, a teacher in Wana, a town in South Waziristan, said in a telephone interview that the American and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> governments had neglected the tribal areas after supporting militants there in the 1980's anti-Soviet jihad. Asked if Mr. bin Laden was hiding in the tribal areas, Mr. Wazir responded angrily. ''America brought Osama bin Laden to this region,'' he said. ''They know his whereabouts better than me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the Pakistani government's efforts to win over residents by building schools, wells and roads there, cooperating with Pakistani and American investigators continues to be considered ''napak kam,'' or dirty work, among many tribesmen, Pakistani officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aside from tribal members, the militants may be getting help from some officers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-Services Intelligence, the country's powerful intelligence agency. The agency was the hidden power behind the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan and was close to Al Qaeda. Pakistani civilian security and police officials complained in the past that intelligence agency personnel have sometimes interfered with their efforts to arrest Qaeda members. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials warn that suspicion of the United States prevents a significant American presence. Since the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, many Pakistanis fear that the United States will bomb Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons, and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be next. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Pakistani security official said opposition to American forces in the country would be widespread. ''The day the American troops cross into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> territory, that will be the day when the Pakistani government will be hard put to stop the people who say, 'Why don't you reverse your position on helping America?''' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They already say, 'You have done too much to help America.''' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American intelligence officials say that the war in Iraq provided a powerful new recruiting tool for Al Qaeda. The conflict has diverted resources -- C.I.A. paramilitary personnel and pilotless Predator surveillance aircraft -- from Afghanistan to Iraq in 2002, several current and former intelligence and administration officials said. They contend the war in Iraq weakened the focus of the United States, giving Al Qaeda time to regroup. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been a sanctuary for some Qaeda figures since soon after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. When the Taliban government fell in the winter of 2001, some Qaeda leaders went west to Iran, but a large group of Qaeda members, including many of Mr. bin Laden's lieutenants, went south to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, intelligence officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By spring 2002, South Waziristan had become ''the hub of Al Qaeda operations in the whole world,'' one senior Pakistani official said. Local religious leaders offered the militants houses, while poor tribesmen collected handsome rents on their homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They soon established a highly effective security system. A network of tribesmen augmented by radios and satellite phones acted as lookouts and notified them whenever more than one vehicle left a new Pakistani army base in Wana. ''They could get warnings,'' said a senior Pakistani official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The foreign militants are flush with cash, use a highly sophisticated code when communicating, travel in small groups at night, are disciplined and have access to laptop computers, Pakistani military officials say. The network has even sent e-mail messages, letters and DVD's to Pakistani soldiers fighting in the tribal areas urging them not to kill their fellow Muslims on behalf of America, according to Western diplomats.<BR><BR>A Pre-Election Warning<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. has intermittently received information about Mr. bin Laden's movements along the Pakistani frontier, but it has always come too late to act against him, officials said. ''There is no credible information that he has ever left the border region'' since Tora Bora, one American analyst said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many American analysts have concluded that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian who is Mr. bin Laden's chief deputy, is also along </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border -- in the tribal lands or an adjacent region -- but is no longer with Mr. bin Laden. American officials contend that the two men separated for security reasons, but remain in close communication. That may explain why over the last year or more they have each issued audio and videotapes broadcast over Arab television, but have not been seen or heard together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Days before the American presidential election this fall, Mr. bin Laden released a videotape warning the United States to change course to prevent future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast to his haggard appearance in his videotaped message televised in September 2003, Mr. bin Laden appeared vigorous. C.I.A. officials say they are not certain of the state of his health, but have long been dismissive of reports that he suffered from kidney disease or some other serious ailment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the shortcomings of the Pakistani border campaign, the Bush administration contends that General Musharraf has taken great personal and political risks to side with the United States against Al Qaeda, and is unwilling to push him too hard or too publicly. Out of deference to President Musharraf, the official United States position on Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts is that he is on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Afghanistan border, a description that avoids pointing fingers at Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American counterterrorism officials cite the vital role Pakistani security services have played in catching Qaeda operatives, including several important figures, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities. In urban areas, security officials can argue that they are doing police work, and can arrest Qaeda operatives one by one without much political unrest. ''The key high value targets that have been picked up in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been picked up in the cities,'' one American intelligence official said. ''We haven't gotten any out of the border.'' A benefit of the recent campaign is that it has forced foreign Islamic fighters from lowlands of South Waziristan into mountains and forests, other tribal areas or Pakistani cities, American and Pakistani intelligence officials say. ''It caused movement, and hopefully that will expose them and we can target them,'' an American said.<BR><BR>A 'Success' Meets Skepticism<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of November, the Pakistani government called the South Waziristan operation a success, saying that Mr. bin Laden was not there. Meeting with President Bush in Washington recently, General Musharraf declared that Pakistani forces had ''broken the back'' of the Qaeda network in his country and destroyed its training bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many American intelligence officials have been skeptical of the effort, though, noting that the Pakistanis often alerted tribal leaders to raids beforehand and mostly only snared foot soldiers. To rout Al Qaeda and find Mr. bin Laden is going to require a much more sustained campaign by the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, intelligence officials from those countries say. The United States is spending $4.5 million to help build roads, wells and schools in the tribal areas, an amount dwarfed by the $18 billion the United States is spending on the reconstruction of Iraq. Pakistani officials and others say economic development, locally elected government and full integration of the tribal areas into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are the only way to eradicate militancy from the isolated area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''To really neutralize and eliminate them, it will have to be a lot more effort,'' said Talat Masood, an Islamabad political analyst and former general. ''They are still a very potent force.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American airstrike carried out on a village in the Bajaur tribal region of northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early Friday was aimed at Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's second-in-command, and Pakistani officials were trying to determine if he had been killed, American and Pakistani officials said Friday. As many as 17 people were killed in the airstrike, Pakistani officials and witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American and Pakistani officials said they believed that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been carried out with a missile launched from a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was described by other American and Pakistani officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Villagers and security officials said the aircraft, which they described as American, swept into the Pakistani tribal region from Kunar Province in eastern Afghanistan about 3:15 a.m. local time Friday and fired missiles at residential buildings in Damadola, a village several miles from the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CNN and ABC News reported Friday night that Mr. Zawahiri, an Egyptian, might have been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but their reports could not be confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Citing unidentified American sources, CNN said intelligence suggested that Mr. Zawahiri had been in a building that was struck. ABC, citing anonymous Pakistani military officials, said on its Web site that five of those killed were high-level Qaeda figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not granted American forces in Afghanistan the right to cross the border, even in pursuit of militants. American-led coalition forces clashing with militants in the mountainous province of Kunar say they have often been frustrated by their foes' use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States military spokesmen in Afghanistan and at the Pentagon said they had no reports of American aircraft active in the area at the time of the explosions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked if a pilotless Predator aircraft might have been operating in the area, Maj. Todd Vician, a public affairs officer at the Pentagon, said he did not know. ''Those are operational details that we don't track,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the cat-and-mouse game between United States forces and Qaeda leaders, there have been attempts over several years to kill Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mr. Zawahiri, with rumors that Mr. Zawahiri has been killed, or nearly killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March 2004, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government indicated that in a battle between Pakistani soldiers and militants, Mr. Zawahiri had been surrounded. But they later backed away from their statements, and within days there was a new taped message said to be from Mr. Zawahiri, calling for President Pervez Musharraf to be ousted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> information minister, Sheik Rashid Ahmed, said in a telephone interview early Saturday that the government was investigating the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that he knew that 14 to 15 people had been killed, ''mostly civilians.'' But asked if Mr. Zawahiri was a target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he said, ''We have no confirmation of that.''] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Witnesses from Damadola said 14 of the dead belonged to one family and included several women and children. Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, a member of Parliament who lives in a village near Damadola, said he saw a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surveying the area hours before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been flying over the area for the last three, four days, and I had a feeling that something nasty was going to happen,'' he said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was awakened from deep slumber by the noise of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and then, together with thousands of others who too had been woken up by the plane's noise, saw jets targeting the area,'' he said. ''One plane circled the area and dropped illuminating flares and the other planes fired missiles. There were loud explosions.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the planes' targets were three houses, all belonging to jewelry dealers. ''The houses have been razed to the ground,'' said Mr. Rashid, who said he had visited the scene. ''There is nothing left. Pieces of the missiles are scattered all around. The impact of the explosions have been huge. Everything has been blackened in a 100-meter radius.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the Pakistani military, Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, said he did not know the cause of the blasts. ''People heard explosions and as a result, there were a number of casualties,'' he said. ''My information is that 11 to 14 people have been killed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is the second report of an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on civilians in a Pakistani tribal region in recent days. Eight people, including women and children, were reported killed last Saturday when a helicopter fired at the house of a local cleric in North Waziristan close to the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lodged a strong protest with coalition forces on Monday, but said it was still investigating whether the missiles had been fired from Pakistani airspace or from Afghan territory.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Jan. 14 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government on Saturday condemned a deadly American airstrike on a village in the northwestern tribal region, and a senior Pakistani security official said he was confident that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2 leader of Al Qaeda and the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not been in the village when it was hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, the Foreign Ministry condemned the loss of civilian lives and said it had delivered an official protest to the American ambassador in Islamabad. The information minister, Sheik Rashid Ahmed, said in Islamabad that the government wanted ''to assure the people we will not allow such incidents to reoccur,'' The Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials in the Bajaur district, where the airstrike happened, said 18 civilians had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including six children. But the senior Pakistani official who spoke of Mr. Zawahiri suggested that the death toll was higher, and he said that at least 11 militants had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven of the dead were Arab fighters, and another four were Pakistani militants from Punjab Province, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the news media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials have said the American airstrike, on the village of Damadola, was believed to have been carried out in the early morning hours on Friday by a remotely piloted Predator aircraft armed with missiles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, a Central Intelligence Agency spokesman declined to comment on any raid that might have taken place. The agency is known to operate armed Predator aircraft, but the missions remain classified and are not generally acknowledged by the C.I.A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House had no immediate comment, said a spokesman, Blair Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Pervez Musharraf of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mentioned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during a meeting on Saturday with officials from the town of Sawabi, according to a local reporter. He was quoted as saying: ''We are looking into it, as to who has done it. We are looking into it, that there were people who came from outside.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thousands of tribesmen, led by a local parliamentarian, protested the killings on Saturday, chanting anti-American and anti-government slogans in the town of Khaar, the central administrative center of Bajaur. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the rally dispersed, 800 to 900 men went on a rampage and attacked the offices of two nongovernmental organizations in the town, according to the local Pakistani reporter. People in the crowd looted computers from an American-financed aid organization called BEST and then torched the compound. The office of an Italian aid group, Intersos, was smashed and looted before the authorities intervened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, the Pakistani security official described some of the intelligence surrounding the airstrike. He said that a dinner at which Mr. Zawahiri was expected had been planned for Thursday night. A local cleric, Maulavi Liaqat, was at the dinner, but he left around midnight, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the airstrike, Mr. Liaqat was again at the scene, and he had the bodies of the Arab militants pulled from the rubble and taken away, the security official said. A second cleric, Maulavi Atta Muhammad, took away the Pakistani militants, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second American official who acknowledged that Mr. Zawahiri had been the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it was probably too soon to know for certain whether he had been at the scene. The American official acknowledged that intelligence was often imperfect, and said that American operations in the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border region reflected a continuing, intensive effort to track down Mr. Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden and their followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a radio interview last month, Vice Adm. John Scott Redd, retired, head of the National Counterterrorism Center, declined to discuss the raids in detail but said ''there's an awful lot of pressure'' on senior Qaeda leaders. ''Whenever there's pressure, which means the more you talk, the more you move, the more you do anything, the more vulnerable you become,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Admiral Redd also pointed out in the interview that Mr. bin Laden had not made a public statement in more than a year and said ''there are a lot of theories'' as to what that might mean. He declined to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not granted American forces in Afghanistan the right to cross the border, even in pursuit of militants. President Musharraf has made a point of highlighting Pakistani security efforts to hunt down militant figures taking shelter in the lawless northwestern tribal region, but American officials have expressed frustration with a lack of progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government announced a potentially huge victory in the effort in March 2004, saying Mr. Zawahiri had been surrounded in a battle between Pakistani soldiers and militants in the tribal region. But the government later backed away from the statement, and within days there was a new taped message said to be from Mr. Zawahiri, calling for President Musharraf's ouster. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hunt for Mr. Zawahiri has heated up again during the past six months and has been focused on the Bajaur district, the senior Pakistani official said. Unlike Mr. bin Laden, who has stayed out of public view, Mr. Zawahiri has been vocal, releasing several videotapes and audiotapes with messages for his followers and containing threats of further </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Western interests. He is also thought by intelligence officials to move around the region more than Mr. bin Laden does, making him somewhat less difficult to track. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zawahiri has a wife who is a Pashtun from the Mohmand tribe and he has been known to visit her and their two children at the home of his father-in-law on the border between the districts of Bajaur and Mohmand, the official said. He is also known to have visited different parts of Bajaur where Arabs and other militants are active in training and mounting insurgent operations across the border into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Damadola, the village hit by the missiles, a local member of Parliament, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, said he saw a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft surveying the area hours before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and was later awakened by huge explosions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said three houses had been hit by the airstrikes. ''The houses have been razed to the ground,'' said Mr. Rashid, who said he had visited the scene. ''There is nothing left. Pieces of the missiles are scattered all around. The impact of the explosions have been huge. Everything has been blackened in a 100-meter radius.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Damadola has been the focus of previous security operations as well. The Pakistani authorities carried out an operation in the village in April 2004 against a cleric, Maulavi Faqir Mohammad, whom they blamed for giving sanctuary to militants. He has been at large since, but turned up Friday and spoke at the funeral of the civilian dead, denouncing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> local residents said. He left the area immediately afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a speech he gave to townspeople in Sawabi, President Musharraf warned that aiding militants was dangerous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we harbor foreign terrorists, those who carry out bomb blasts throughout the world, then remember that our future is not good,'' he said. ''People should not side with foreign militants,'' he said. ''They should tell us about them so we take action against them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He did not directly criticize the United States for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it was left to the Foreign Ministry to protest the infringement of sovereignty. ''Our armed forces have undertaken large-scale operations against the foreign militants, and it remainsour responsibility to protect our people and territory from outside intrusion,'' the ministry said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The statement was the second in two weeks in which the Pakistani government has condemned what was thought to be an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its soil. Eight people, including women and children, were reported killed Jan. 7 when missiles destroyed the house of a local cleric in North Waziristan close to the Afghan border. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lodged a strong protest with coalition forces on Monday, but said it was still investigating whether the missiles had been fired from Pakistani airspace or from Afghan territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In December, a man that American officials identified as Al Qaeda's operations commander, Hamza Rabia, was killed in North Waziristan by what witnesses said was a missile fired by a remotely piloted aircraft. The C.I.A. also refused to comment on that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been a number of incidents of civilian deaths in failed or misdirected American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan and along the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one in December 2003, nine children and a 25-year-old man were killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from a Predator in Hutala, a village in a remote area of southern Ghazni Province. The intended target, a Taliban supporter who was suspected of being behind several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on foreign aid and construction workers, was not among the dead and may have not been in the village at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American military command expressed regret for the killings and sent officers to the village to apologize. President Hamid Karzai said he was ''profoundly shocked'' and demanded that the United States forces coordinate their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the Afghan government in the future.<BR><BR>Ex-Taliban Official Is Killed<BR><BR>KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 14 (AP) -- Two gunmen on a motorcycle killed a former Taliban leader on Saturday outside his home in Kandahar, police officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The victim, Mullah Abdul Samad Khaksar, was a deputy interior minister under the Taliban government in Afghanistan. He switched loyalties and supported Afghanistan's American-backed government after the Taliban militia was ousted in late 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Kandahar police chief, Gen. Abdul Wahid, said Mullah Khaksar was shot in the heart and head as he was walking with two of his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Taliban spokesman, Qari Muhammad Yusuf Ahmadi, said the group had killed Mullah Khaksar because he was a traitor and said the same fate awaited other turncoats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mullah Khaksar was one of a number of former Taliban leaders who have changed sides. The government has encouraged Taliban members to go through a formal reconciliation program. So far, about 300 rank-and-file members and about 50 senior officials have done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other violence blamed on holdouts from the former Taliban government, two bomb blasts ripped through crowds of civilians in eastern Khost province on Saturday as residents were celebrating Id al-Adha, the Islamic feast of sacrifice, said a local doctor, Amir Pacha Ramatzi. One person was killed and 40 were wounded, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A suicide car bombing on Saturday targeting an American-Afghan military convoy in southern Helmand province wounded an American soldier, said a local police chief, Khan Mohammed. An American military spokesman said the soldier was hospitalized and in stable condition.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POUND for pound and pounding for pounding, the Israeli military is one of the world's finest. But Hezbollah, with the discipline and ferocity of its fighters and ability to field advanced weaponry, has taken Israel by surprise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that surprise has rocketed back to Washington and across the American military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States officials worry that they're not prepared, either, for Hezbollah's style of warfare -- a kind that pits finders against hiders and favors the hiders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certain that other terrorists are learning from Hezbollah's successes, the United States is studying the conflict closely for lessons to apply to its own wars. Military planners suggest that the Pentagon take a page out of Hezbollah's book about small-unit, agile operations as it battles insurgents and cells in Iraq and Afghanistan and plans for countering more cells and their state sponsors across the Middle East and in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States and Israel have each fought conventional armies of nation-states and shadowy terror organizations. But Hezbollah, with the sophistication of a national army (it almost sank an Israeli warship with a cruise missile) and the lethal invisibility of a guerrilla army, is a hybrid. Old labels, and old planning, do not apply. Certainly its style of 21st-century combat is known -- on paper. The style even has its own labels, including network warfare, or net war, and fourth-generation warfare, although many in the military don't care for such titles. But the battlefields of south Lebanon prove that it is here, and sooner than expected. And the American national security establishment is struggling to adapt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are now into the first great war between nations and networks,'' said John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School, and a leading analyst of net warfare. ''This proves the growing strength of networks as a threat to American national security.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a talk that Mr. Arquilla calls Net Warfare 101, he describes how traditional militaries are organized in a strict hierarchy, from generals down to privates. In contrast, networks flatten the command structure. They are distributed, dispersed, agile, mobile, improvisational. This makes them effective, and hard to track and target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A net war differs from all previous wars, which were about brute confrontation of forces, mass on mass -- what Matthew Arnold called bloody contests of ''ignorant armies'' meeting on the ''darkling plain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Net war is the battle of the many, organized in small units, against conventional militaries that organize their many into large units. These network forces are not ignorant. They are computer literate, propaganda and Internet savvy, and capable of firing complicated weapons to great effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The pooling of information is certainly a characteristic of these kinds of insurgencies,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who served on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton before joining the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''In Iraq, for example, the lessons on how to build and place I.E.D.'s have spread and been assimilated in record time. There is certain to be the insurgent equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation on Hezbollah's successes that will make the rounds of the insurgent and terrorist Web sites.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hezbollah spent the last six years dispersing about 12,000 rockets across southern Lebanon in a vast web of hidden caches, all divided into local zones with independent command. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They dug tunnels. They dug bunkers, they established communications systems -- cellphones, radios, even runners to carry messages that aren't susceptible to eavesdropping,'' said one military officer with experience in the Middle East. ''They divided southern Lebanon into military zones with many small units that operate independently, without the need for central control.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israel, Hezbollah dispersed its fighters with no distinguishing markings or uniforms or vehicles. Fighters access the weapons only at the moment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and then disappear. This makes preventing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> all but impossible. It is a significant modernization of classic guerrilla hit-and-run tactics. Israel has been unable to significantly degrade the numbers of rockets because of this approach. Hezbollah fired more than 100 a day at the start of this conflict; they are still firing more than 100 a day, despite Israeli bombardment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hezbollah still possesses the most dangerous aspects of a shadowy terror network. It abides by no laws of war as it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilians indiscriminately. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its positions carry a high risk of killing innocents. At the same time, it has attained military capabilities and other significant attributes of a nation-state. It holds territory and seats in the Lebanese government. It fields high-tech weapons and possesses the firepower to threaten the entire population of a regional superpower, or at least those in the northern half of Israel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Hezbollah has emerged as a new kind of threat, it cannot be forgotten that the network is a creation of Iran, with the support of Syria, and both countries know they cannot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israel -- or American interests -- directly. The Bush administration is debating internally whether the best course of action against Iran and Syria is to negotiate with them, isolate them, or do something stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hezbollah's success in surviving Israeli bombardment poses an immediate implication for American military planning as the United States figures out what to do about Iran, either as part of an effort to halt its nuclear ambitions or a broader offensive with political goals, like regime change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pentagon planners who focus on the region predict that the American military would face a conflict far less conventional than that of the armored columns that rushed to Baghdad and toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran trained Hezbollah, and it can fight like Hezbollah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military planners say they are closely studying groups like the Basij paramilitary force -- organized, trained and equipped by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to provide a ready-made Iranian network of 90,000 full-time forces, 300,000 reservists and a mobilization base of up to a million men that would dwarf the insurgency bedeviling American efforts in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also of great interest in the military threat of these networks is that some of the most significant technologies once held in near-monopoly control by the American military are now available at L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer and Sharper Image, among them high-quality night-vision goggles and global positioning devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are in a world today where we have a non-state actor using all the tools of weaponry,'' from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to rockets to computer hacking, said P.W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in the impact of new technologies on national security. ''That's what this new 21st-century warfare is going to look like. We have now entered an era where non-states or quasi-states do a lot better militarily than states do.'' He added, ''I don't think we have answers yet for what to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States also has to take into account Hezbollah's global reach -- it is blamed for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Jewish and Israeli targets in Argentina in the 1990's, and its cells operate in Latin America, across the Middle East and in Southeast Asia, and it could </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American interests in any of those places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Critical to the American response, military officers and academic experts say, is that the United States acknowledge that its takes anetwork to fight a network. American intelligence agencies and the military proved it can fight this kind of war, as it did in Afghanistan to rout Al Qaeda, when intelligence officers and small groups of Army Special Forces worked with local fighters to call in devastating air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and drive the Taliban from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within the Bush adminstration and across the military, a clearer view is emerging out of the chaos in southern Lebanon. It is that nation-states know they cannot directly take on superpowers -- either regional or global -- without getting their clocks cleaned, and so they use proxies they train and support to take the fight to those superpowers. The fight against groups like Hezbollah requires a strategy for dealing with their sponsors. These networks, Hezbollah included, don't float around in the ether like free electrons bumping into each other. They alight. They attach themselves to territory. In Afghanistan it was with the full support of the Taliban. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it's an ungoverned space. In Lebanon, it's a state within a state. Cut off state support, or eliminate the ability of the networks to survive in ungoverned areas, and they collapse on themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No solution has been written. But it would include military force along with diplomacy, economic assistance, intelligence and information campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Most critically, we have to get better at -- it's such a cliche -- winning hearts and minds,'' said a military officer working on counterinsurgency issues. ''That is influencing neutral populations toward supporting us and not supporting our terrorist and insurgent enemies.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like some terrorist version of broadcast pundits, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri address the world by video or audio every few weeks, exhorting their followers to jihad, taunting their enemies and offering sometimes grandiose commentary on current events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether that is all they can do from their hide-outs in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a question that intelligence officials in the United States and Europe are urgently trying to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''They keep informed, that is clear,'' said Olivier Roy, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an expert on Islamist terror networks. ''Whether they have any operational role is very hard to say.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The arrest in Britain last week of a score of Muslims of Pakistani ancestry, accused of an ambitious plot to blow up trans-Atlantic jetliners, has returned a spotlight to the top two leaders of Al Qaeda, who for five years have evaded one of history's biggest manhunts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because there are clear connections between the Britons arrested in and around London and their accused co-conspirators detained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, officials have not ruled out the possibility of communications between the plotters and the Qaeda chiefs. No one has suggested that either man directed the scheme -- but the fact that neither Mr. bin Laden or Mr. Zawahri has been captured suggests that Western intelligence agencies' knowledge of their activities is minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Senate testimony in June, Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department's counterterrorism chief, suggested that American-led efforts to pursue the two had severely limited their ability to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is evidence that core leaders, including bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, are frustrated by their lack of direct control,'' Mr. Crumpton said, asserting that they had been isolated as they lost safe havens in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''We must retain this unrelenting pressure against Al Qaeda, especially their leadership, to further diminish the links throughout their global networks.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American diplomats in the region play down the importance of Mr. bin Laden, saying Pakistani military operations in the northwest region of Waziristan have curtailed his movements. They are less certain of the limits on Mr. Zawahri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Scheuer, who tracked Mr. bin Laden in the 1990's at the Central Intelligence Agency, is skeptical about the standard government claim that the two men are on the run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we were really chasing them around, we would have them by now,'' Mr. Scheuer said. He said it was clear that the Qaeda leaders still had some operational ability because they were able to make audio and video tapes and to send them to allies who post them on the Web or pass them to Al Jazeera, the Arabic television channel in Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the two leaders have often said their role is to inspire the global jihad, their ability to get their message out is itself a notable achievement. In a letter last year to the leader of the Iraq insurgency, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Mr. Zawahri wrote, ''We are in a battle, and more than half of this battle is taking place in the battlefield of the media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zarqawi was killed on June 7, when American forces located him at a safe house north of Baghdad and dropped two 500-pound bombs on it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An analysis by the private Virginia company IntelCenter said that Al Qaeda's clandestine media operation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, As-Sahab, had released at a record pace this year 37 video and audio messages through the end of July, including 6 from Mr. bin Laden and 11 from Mr. Zawahri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I just don't see that they have any trouble disseminating information to followers, and they seem to have more sophisticated communications than they did six months ago,'' said Chris Heffelfinger, a terrorism analyst who monitors jihadist Web sites for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American officials concede that the loyalty both men inspire makes even the large bounty on their heads -- up to $25 million each -- an ineffective weapon. ''I'm not sure that the $25 million does a damn bit of good,'' said one American intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Counterterrorism experts agree that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become the most important center for jihadist networks, in some ways replicating the role of Afghanistan before American troops ousted Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in late 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The efforts of the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to help American antiterrorist operations have been limited both by the popularity in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of groups violently opposing Indian control of Kashmir and by his government's minimal control over the lawless tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is in those areas that Mr. bin Laden, the 49-year-old son of a Saudi construction magnate, and Mr. Zawahri, 55, an Egyptian doctor who was jailed and tortured in Egypt in the 1980's, are believed to be in separate hiding places. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American intelligence official said the men are believed to have direct contact with a small number of trusted aides who speak to others for them. ''They're extremely careful about who they talk to,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military and intelligence agencies have made repeated attempts to hunt them down. In January a missile fired by an American Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a pilotless aircraft, targeted a house in the tribal Bajaur district where Mr. Zawahri was believed to be attending a dinner; it killed 18 civilians and a number of militants, Pakistani officials said, but missed its prime target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In typically defiant style, Mr. Zawahri responded two weeks later with a taunting video statement broadcast on Al Jazeera. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calling President Bush a ''failed crusader,'' Mr. Zawahri asked: ''Bush, do you know where I am? I am among the Muslim masses enjoying their care with God's blessings and sharing with them their holy war against you until we defeat you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As often in such tapes, Mr. Zawahri addressed ''the American people,'' saying ''Bush and his gangs are shedding your blood and wasting your money in frustrated adventures'' in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. bin Laden's somewhat rarer recent pronouncements have been audiotapes accompanied by a still photo, perhaps indicating that he wanted to avoid video cameras for security reasons. Like his deputy, he often makes reference to current events, implicitly asserting a claim to leadership in the Muslim world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They try to connect all the different crises, in Iraq, Lebanon, other places, and present themselves as the vanguard of the global Muslim community,'' said Mr. Roy, the French terrorism expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In April, Mr. bin Laden urged jihadists to go to the troubled Darfur region of Sudan if Western troops were deployed there. In May, he recounted his selection of the 19 hijackers for the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and insisted that the just-sentenced Zacarias Moussaoui was not one of them. In June, he eulogized the just-killed Mr. Zarqawi as a fellow ''lion of Islam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even if we lost one of our greatest knights and princes, we are happy that we have found a symbol for our great Islamic nations, one that the mujahedeen will remember and praise in poetry and in stories secretly and aloud,'' Mr. bin Laden declared in the rambling 19-minute tape.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 30 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani military said Monday that it had destroyed a religious school in the Bajaur tribal area, near the border with Afghanistan, killing as many as 80 people it described as militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Helicopter gunships fired missiles into the Islamic school, or madrasa, in the village of Chingai near the town of Khar, military officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those reported killed in the predawn </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was Maulvi Liaqut, a cleric whom the authorities have accused of sheltering local and foreign militants. Mr. Liaqut was affiliated with the banned militant organization Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi, which had recruited thousands of Pakistanis to fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We received confirmed intelligence reports that 70 to 80 militants were hiding in a madrasa used as a terrorist-training facility, which was destroyed by an army </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by helicopters,'' Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, a military spokesman, told The Associated Press. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No high-value target was present at the time of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' General Sultan was quoted as saying, referring to top leaders of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some local residents and opposition politicians said there were children in the school, and contended that American planes had participated in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Sultan said that no children or women had been in the madrasa and that no American or NATO troops had been involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local television channels showed images of the site, where thousands of people had gathered around the rubble of the madrasa. Armed men were seen standing amid the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Residents of the nearby village of Damadola, reached by telephone, said they were awakened Monday at about 5 a.m. by two explosions, and when they went to look, it appeared that the school had been destroyed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Haroon Rashid, a lawmaker from Jamaat-e-Islami who lives half a mile from the school, said that the two explosions were ''so powerful that it shook the earth and rattled our doors and windows.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army helicopter gunships appeared 15 minutes later, firing rockets, the residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One man, who identified himself as Akhunzada, said local residents had seen planes flying over the area in recent days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Sultan was quoted as saying that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out after those in charge of the building refused warnings to close it down. The A.P. quoted hospital officials as saying that only three of the people inside the building had survived, and that they were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials dismissed any suggestions that the United States was behind the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tasnim Aslam, the spokeswoman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry, said at a weekly news briefing that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not carried out in response to foreign pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But opposition Islamist parties were quick to denounce the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and blame America. Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, contended that innocent children had been killed. ''Why have they owned this very shameful act of killing the innocent people?'' Mr. Ahmed said at a news briefing, contending that the Pakistani Army was covering up for an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This area is not an area where there can be any training camp,'' he said. ''This is actually tantamount to a declaration of war on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an alliance of opposition Islamist parties, called for nationwide protests on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Siraj ul-Haq, a cabinet minister from the nearby North-West Frontier Province, condemned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said he would resign from the government in protest, The A.P. reported. ''The government has launched an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the night, which is against Islam and the traditions of the area,'' Mr. Haq said. ''This was an unprovoked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a madrasa.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Liaqut was a known supporter of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He is believed to have removed the bodies of foreign Qaeda militants killed in an airstrike last January in Damadola by an American Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a pilotless aircraft. The aircraft was operated by the Central Intelligence Agency in an effort to capture Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda's second in command. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zawahri was not present at the time, but local officials said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 18 civilians, causing nationwide outrage and galvanizing tribes in the region in their opposition to the government in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The airstrikes on Monday came as tribal elders in Bajaur were beginning talks with pro-Taliban militants, including Mr. Liaqut, in an effort supported by the government to stem cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan. Similar overtures in North Waziristan led to an agreement recently with pro-Taliban groups there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very strange, as we were told Sunday that the peace agreement would be signed,'' Mohammed Sadiq, a local lawmaker, told The A.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Faqir Muhammad, believed to be a deputy of Mr. Zawahri, addressed a crowd of mourners on Monday at a mass funeral for the victims, The A.P. reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday happened two days after thousands of tribesmen protested in Bajaur, which borders the restive Afghan province of Kunar, against the United States and its Pakistani supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NATO and Afghan officials have repeatedly made accusations that militants linked to the Taliban have taken shelter in the border region to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on civilians and Western troops in southern Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan government has accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of allowing the Taliban and Al Qaeda to build a power base among the independent tribal population along the border. The Pakistani government has said it has sent more than 80,000 troops to the tribal areas near the Afghan border to flush out the militants.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 8 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber detonated explosives on a military training ground in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday morning, killing at least 42 army recruits and wounding about 20 more in the deadliest terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Pakistani military on record, government officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suspicion immediately fell on Pakistani militants who had vowed vengeance for an airstrike on a madrasa, or religious school, that killed 83 people near the Afghan border in the Bajaur district on Oct. 30.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani military claimed responsibility for that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which it said was against militants in terrorist training. But residents and opposition politicians contend that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was conducted by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft, though the Pakistani government denies it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sudden escalation of casualties in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fight against militants is likely to further polarize public opinion, which is already broadly opposed to President Pervez Musharraf's cooperation with the United States and his military campaign against tribes in border regions. It may also raise questions in the military about the campaign, in which about 600 soldiers have been killed in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said a suicide bomber wrapped in a shawl ran onto the military training ground, in Dargai, a town in North-West Frontier Province, and detonated his bomb amid about 130 recruits around 8:40 a.m. The military reported that 42 soldiers had been killed, but that number may rise, because some of the wounded were in critical condition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was a guy with a short beard, wearing a shawl,'' Khalid Mehmood, 18, a student who was walking on a road nearby and was wounded by shrapnel, told a local journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gulam Younas, a shopkeeper across the parade ground, said he was working when he heard a big explosion. ''Amidst the rising dust, I saw bodies lying on the ground, wounded soldiers, limbs, shoes,'' he said. ''It was horrible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military was pursuing a man suspected of being an accomplice Wednesday night who was chased to sugar cane fields several miles away. The man, described as in his mid-20s with a short beard, had been was spotted close to the scene of the blast by townspeople who said he was behaving suspiciously, military and security officials said. When someone fired on him, the officials said, he pulled out a hand grenade and threatened to hurl it at them, then disappeared into fields in a nearby village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About 400 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army soldiers and paramilitary Frontier Constabulary set up a cordon around the thick cane fields, which cover a little more than a square mile. Army tracking dogs, helicopters, searchlights and flares were brought in to help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An unidentified caller told a local journalist on Wednesday that ''Pakistani Taliban'' were behind the suicide bombing and were retaliating for the airstrike in Bajaur on Oct. 30. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been followed by daily demonstrations and protests against the government and the perceived American involvement in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least one militant leader from the Bajaur area, Maulana Faqir Muhammad, threatened to carry out revenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Government officials in Islamabad, the capital, said Wednesday that the suicide bombing was linked to Bajaur, but emphasized that rather than a revenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was a proof of terrorist training in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can trace back the linkage with Bajaur,'' said Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, the chief military spokesman, Reuters reported. ''We have been receiving intelligence reports about militants being trained for such activities,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is linked with the Bajaur incident. It is not a consequence,'' said Mr. Sherpao, the interior minister. ''It is linked in the sense that suicide bombers were trained in the area.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign fighters and operatives for Al Qaeda are known to be at large in the mountainous tribal regions adjoining Afghanistan. Local fighters and the militants are accused of training bombers and orchestrating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from their hide-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani intelligence official said Monday at a briefing that the madrasa in Bajaur had been receiving money from Al Qaeda to train militants and send them to Afghanistan to fight American and Afghan forces. Abu Faraj al-Libbi, an important Qaeda operative who was arrested in May 2005, disclosed under interrogation that he and other Qaeda members had visited the madrasa, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The anonymous telephone caller on Wednesday, who called the journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai of The News, a national newspaper, said that the suicide bombing had been carried out by a group led by Abu Kalim Muhammad Ansari, an otherwise unknown figure. The caller contended that the group had 274 more volunteers ready to be suicide bombers, Mr. Yusufzai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet while Pashtun tribesmen in border areas have sympathized with the Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda, suicide bombing is new to them. Many Pashtuns say such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are alien to their tribal code, Pashtunwali, which forbids the killing of innocent people, and to their understanding of Islam, which forbids suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Musharraf has vowed to continue to fight such militants and to crush terrorism in almost daily comments since the Bajaur </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the suicide bombing is likely to increase the pressure on him to end military action in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are very few now who think the military is an instrument that will work,'' said Talat Masood, a military analyst and retired general. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an American Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas in January missed Al Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, by just two hours, an intelligence official here says, disclosing that the hunt for Al Qaeda's leaders had come much closer to killing him than was previously thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zawahri left a dinner in the village of Damadola at 10:30 on the night of Jan. 12, with Maulavi Liaqat, a local supporter, an intelligence official with knowledge of the incident said in an interview. The house where they had eaten was hit at 12:30 that night, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, amid an angry public backlash in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which killed a reported 18 people, American and Pakistani officials said only that Mr. Zawahri was expected at the dinner that night, but had failed to appear. The official spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The details emerged in the aftermath of a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Oct. 30 on a madrasa, or religious school, in the same district of the tribal region of Bajaur, close to the Afghan border. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed a reported 83 people. Among them was Mr. Liaqat, the madrasa's leader, and three of his sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the Pakistani government's announcement that it had conducted the precision-guided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the madrasa, residents of the area said that they believed that it was also carried out by a United States Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which they heard overhead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Helicopters arrived 10 to 15 minutes later and fired several rockets into the hillside, said Haroon Rashid, a member of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament representing the religious party, Jamaat-e-Islami, and who lives nearby. A Pakistani security official confirmed that pilotless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were flying over the area in the days around Oct. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> set off rallies and demonstrations in the tribal areas and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities, protesting the high number of casualties and the perceived American involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also is believed to have prompted a revenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, when a suicide bomber killed at least 42 army recruits and wounded 20 more by blowing himself up at a military training ground. It was the deadliest terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ever against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an effort to quell the public anger over the madrasa bombing, Pakistani officials disclosed more details about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the activities of Mr. Liaqat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Pervez Musharraf and his chief military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, have said that the men killed were militants in terrorist training and that they were in no way innocent students. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani intelligence officials have briefed journalists and released copies of infrared camera film showing the compound and its inhabitants in the days before the bombing. In the film, lines of men dressed in loose tribal clothes are seen exercising in the yard of the compound early in the morning. In one part of the film, a bonfire is burning in the center of the yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men, who appear as shadowy figures because the camera picks up their body heat and shows it as black, filter out of a building, which an intelligence official said was their living quarters, and line up in rows. Trainers walk among the rows of men, who appear to do stretches, jog in circles and at one point lie motionless on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American security officials have said that they shared intelligence of the target with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prior to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which suggests that the surveillance footage came from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men would start their exercise at 4:30 a.m., said a Pakistani intelligence official, who gave the briefing and provided the film on a DVD and would speak only on condition of anonymity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred shortly after 5 a.m., hitting the men as they were exercising in the yard, causing maximum casualties. Many of the bodies were in pieces after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> witnesses said. Most of the dead were local tribesmen from Bajaur, with some more from adjoining areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bajaur is a mountainous tribal agency north of Peshawar that runs along one of the most inaccessible areas of Afghanistan, bordering the Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, where American troops are based. It has been a base of Islamic militant fundamentalism since the 1980s, when religious tribal leaders created a local movement, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi, aimed at setting up Shariah, or Islamic law, and supporting the jihad that was being waged in Afghanistan against the Soviet occupation at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, two local militant leaders, Mr. Liaqat and Maulana Faqir Muhammad, members of the now-banned movement, were heavily involved in logistics, recruitment and training of fighters who were sent to fight United States and Afghan forces in Afghanistan, the intelligence official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sufi Muhammad dispatched 600 local tribesmen to support the Taliban in 2001 during the American intervention, most of whom were captured or killed, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The information on the two local leaders was gleaned from the arrest in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in May 2005 of Abu Faraj al-Libbi, who was described as an important Qaeda operative. The local leaders were known to have received funds from Al Qaeda for their activities, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently, American and Pakistani security officials and diplomats say, foreign militants, including Mr. Zawahri, have been using the area since Pakistani military operations pushed the foreign militants out of North and South Waziristan, to the south. Even though the Pakistani government was close to signing an agreement with the tribal elders of Bajaur aimed at curbing militancy, Pakistani officials and Western diplomats admit that Mr. Liaqat was far beyond the control of the government and expressed satisfaction that he has now been removed from the scene. President Musharraf, at a dinner last week in Islamabad for Prince Charles, vowed to conduct more such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In July, we started observing Liaqat training a few people, some 15 to 20 people,'' the intelligence officer said in his briefing. ''He was warned to close the facility, this madrasa. He refused to close it and vowed to continue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was a big decision for us,'' he added. ''There were two options. One was sending in ground troops, the other a precision </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Approaching the compound from the ground would have forfeited any element of surprise, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would be like going into a hornet's nest, and would have caused a lot of casualties to troops and civilians,'' he said. ''There would have been collateral damage and a long drawn battle.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A precision airstrike, which appears to have killed only people inside the compound, would also have provided a warning to others running similar compounds in the area. ''This would send a clear message that this cannot go on,'' the official said. ''They will meet the same fate.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, Pakistan, April 28 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber struck at a political rally here, killing at least 28 people and narrowly missing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interior minister, Aftab Khan Sherpao, and his son in the North-West Frontier Province on Saturday, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Forty people were wounded, some critically, in the blast, including government officials and security officers, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. He added that the death toll might rise because it was difficult to identify remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sherpao was knocked down by the blast, but suffered only cuts and bruises to his legs. ''It was a miracle that I survived,'' he said in an interview at his Peshawar home on Saturday evening. ''Clearly I was the target.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''The impact was massive. The impact caused me to fall, and then there was black smoke.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State television showed the minister being helped to a car after the blast, his white hair disheveled and his clothes spattered with blood. Television news channels showed grisly images of the blast site, with mutilated bodies lying on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber detonated his explosives just as Mr. Sherpao ended his speech and was walking to his car, as the call for evening prayers was sounding. Two men of the minister's security detail stopped the bomber as he approached and were killed in the explosion, news agencies reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan called Mr. Sherpao on Saturday night to express his concern. ''This is part of the game, and this will not break our resolve to fight terrorism,'' Mr. Sherpao said he told Mr. Karzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He continued: ''I suffered minor injuries but my sympathies, thoughts and mind are with those colleagues who have expired. I have a lot of sympathy with their relatives and children. It is an incident that we all condemn and I want to exploit it politically. Our resolve, God willing, will continue,'' he said in comments shown on the state television channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sherpao said that he had also been the target of a suicide bombing attempt in February. The police intercepted a telephone call by the would-be bomber, who did not carry out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because he did not get the explosives in time, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sherpao said the bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have occurred at a political rally on the anniversary of the death of his elder brother, Hayat Muhammad Khan Sherpao, who was killed in a bomb blast on Feb. 8, 1975, while addressing students at Peshawar University. ''This has happened in our family before,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and its prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, condemned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday. General Musharraf is in Turkey, where he is holding talks with Mr. Karzai. Each man has continued to accuse the other of not doing enough to fight terrorism. Mr. Sherpao, who is from the same Pashtun ethnic group as Mr. Karzai, has been an important interlocutor between the presidents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suicide bombings have escalated sharply in Afghanistan over the past 18 months, and the Afghan government has repeatedly warned that the bombers are being trained and indoctrinated in camps and militant establishments in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sherpao did not speculate about who was behind the bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack. Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has also suffered from suicide bombings; Al Qaeda-linked militants, who have sought refuge in the mountainous tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan, are thought to be behind most of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the suicide bombings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past few months have appeared to be sectarian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but others have focused on government and military targets, apparently in revenge for airstrikes on militant camps and compounds in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, an explosion that intelligence officials said was caused by an airstrike from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft killed four people in a compound in Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sherpao has been a firm supporter of the government policy to combat terrorism, and has denounced suicide bombings and those who train the bombers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In December 2003, General Musharraf narrowly escaped injury in two bombings 11 days apart in Rawalpindi; 17 people were killed in the second bombing. Officials blamed Al Qaeda for both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July 2004, a suicide bombing that Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for was directed at Mr. Aziz, the prime minister, in Islamabad a few weeks before he took office. Mr. Aziz was unhurt, but nine others, including his driver, were killed.</SPAN></P>

Andrew Wilson and Luke Wilson are the directors; another brother, Owen Wilson, turns up as the home's evil head nurse.   May 23  The Boss of It All Lars von Trier takes a vacation from the moral excoriation of the ''Dogville'' trilogy to create a funny, tiny, but no less thought-provoking comedy about an actor (Jens Albinus, the cult leader in ''The Idiots'') who is hired to impersonate a fictive corporate head: an imaginary ''no man'' invented by the actual boss of the company (Peter Gantzler) to take the heat for unpopular decisions. With the radiant Iben Hjejle, not much seen in the United States since her turn in ''High Fidelity.''

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A secret military operation in early 2005 to capture senior members of Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas was aborted at the last minute after top Bush administration officials decided it was too risky and could jeopardize relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to intelligence and military officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The target was a meeting of  Qaeda leaders that intelligence officials thought included Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden's top deputy and the man believed to run the terrorist group's operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the mission was called off after Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, rejected an 11th-hour appeal by Porter J. Goss, then the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, officials said. Members of a Navy Seals unit in parachute gear had already boarded C-130 cargo planes in Afghanistan when the mission was canceled, said a former senior intelligence official involved in the planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rumsfeld decided that the operation, which had ballooned from a small number of military personnel and C.I.A. operatives to several hundred, was cumbersome and put too many American lives at risk, the current and former officials said. He was also concerned that it could cause a rift with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an often reluctant ally that has barred the American military from operating in its tribal areas, the officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision to halt the planned ''snatch and grab'' operation frustrated some top intelligence officials and members of the military's secret Special Operations units, who say the United States missed a significant opportunity to try to capture senior members of Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their frustration has only grown over the past two years, they said, as Al Qaeda has improved its abilities to plan global </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and build new training compounds in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, which have become virtual havens for the terrorist network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, the White House has become increasingly irritated with  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, for his inaction on the growing threat of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About a dozen current and former military and intelligence officials were interviewed for this article, all of whom requested anonymity because the planned 2005 mission remained classified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spokesmen for the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and the White House declined to comment. It is unclear whether President Bush was informed about the planned operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials acknowledge that they are not certain that Mr. Zawahri attended the 2005 meeting in North Waziristan, a mountainous province just miles from the Afghan border. But they said that the United States had communications intercepts that tipped them off to the meeting, and that intelligence officials had unusually high confidence that Mr. Zawahri was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Months later, in early May 2005, the C.I.A. launched a missile from a remotely piloted Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing  Haitham al-Yemeni, a senior Qaeda figure whom the C.I.A. had tracked since the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has long been known that C.I.A. operatives conduct counterterrorism missions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. Details of the aborted 2005 operation provide a glimpse into the Bush administration's internal negotiations over whether to take unilateral military action in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where General Musharraf's fragile government is under pressure from dissidents who object to any cooperation with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pentagon officials familiar with covert operations said that planners had to consider  the political and human risks of undertaking  a military campaign in a sovereign country, even in an area like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal lands, where the government has only tenuous control. Even with its shortcomings, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been a vital American ally since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the militaries of the two countries have close ties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon officials said   tension was inherent in any decision to approve such a mission: a smaller military footprint allows a better chance of a mission going undetected, but it also exposes the units to greater risk of being killed or captured. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said  one reason Mr. Rumsfeld called off the 2005 operation was that  the number of troops involved in the mission had grown to several hundred, including Army Rangers, members of the Navy Seals and C.I.A. operatives, and he determined that the United States could no longer carry out the mission without General Musharraf's permission. It is unlikely that the Pakistani president would have approved an operation of that size, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some outside experts said American counterterrorism operations had been hamstrung because of concerns about General Musharraf's shaky government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The reluctance to take risk or jeopardize our political relationship with Musharraf may well account for the fact that five and half years after 9/11 we are still trying to run bin Laden and Zawahri to ground,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those political considerations have created resentment among some members of the military's Special Operations forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Special Operations guys are tearing their hair out at the highest levels,'' said a former Bush administration official with close ties to those troops. While they have not received good intelligence on the whereabouts of top Qaeda members recently, he said, they say they believe they have sometimes had useful information on lower-level figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a degree of frustration that is off the charts, because they are looking at targets on a daily basis and can't move against them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In early 2005, after learning about the Qaeda meeting, the military developed a plan for a small Navy Seals unit to parachute into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to carry out a quick operation, former officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the operation moved up the military chain of command, officials said, various planners bulked up the force's size to provide security for the Special Operations forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The whole thing turned into the invasion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said the former senior intelligence official involved in the planning. Still, he said he thought the mission was worth the risk. ''We were frustrated because we wanted to take a shot,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several former officials interviewed said the operation was not the only occasion since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that plans were developed to use a large American military force in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It is unclear whether any of those missions have been executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the military and intelligence officials familiar with the 2005 events say it showed a rift between operators in the field and a military bureaucracy that has still not effectively adapted to hunt for global terrorists, moving too cautiously to use Special Operations troops against terrorist targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That criticism has echoes of the risk aversion that the officials said pervaded efforts against Al Qaeda during the Clinton administration, when missions to use American troops to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan were never executed because they were considered too perilous, risked killing civilians or were based on inadequate intelligence. Rather than sending in ground troops, the Clinton White House instead chose to fire cruise missiles in what became failed attempts to kill Mr. bin Laden and his deputies -- a tactic Mr. Bush criticized shortly after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, the C.I.A. has launched missiles from Predator aircraft in the tribal areas several times, with varying degrees of success. Intelligence officials say they believe that in January 2006, an airstrike narrowly missed killing Mr. Zawahri, who hours earlier had attended a dinner in Damadola, a Pakistani village. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Musharraf cast his lot with the Bush administration in the hunt for Al Qaeda after the 2001 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and he has periodically ordered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military to conduct counterterrorism missions in the tribal areas, provoking fierce resistance there. But in recent months he has pulled back, prompting Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to issue stern warnings in private that he risked losing American aid if he did not step up efforts against Al Qaeda, senior administration officials have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said that mid-2005 was a period when they were gathering good intelligence about Al Qaeda's leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. By the next year, however, the White House had become frustrated by the lack of progress in the hunt for Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In early 2006, President Bush ordered a ''surge'' of dozens of C.I.A. agents to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, hoping that an influx of intelligence operatives would lead to better information, officials said. But that has brought the United States no closer to locating Al Qaeda's top two leaders. The latest message from them came this week, in a new tape in which Mr. Zawahri urged Iraqis and Muslims around the world to show more support for Islamist insurgents in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his recently published memoir, George J. Tenet, the former C.I.A. director, said the intelligence about Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts during the Clinton years was similarly sparse. The information was usually only at the ''50-60% confidence level,'' he wrote, not sufficient to justify American military action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As much as we all wanted Bin Ladin  dead, the use of force by a superpower requires information, discipline, and time,'' Mr. Tenet wrote. ''We rarely had the information in sufficient quantities or the time to evaluate and act on it.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS the National Intelligence Estimate issued last week confirms, a terrorist haven has emerged in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal belt. And as recent revelations about an aborted 2005 operation in the region demonstrate, our Defense Department is chronically unable to conduct the sort of missions that would disrupt terrorist activity there and in similarly ungoverned places. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are perhaps the most important kind of counterterrorism missions. Because the Pentagon has shown that it cannot carry them out, the Central Intelligence Agency should be given the chance to perform them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The story of the scrubbed 2005 operation illustrates why the Pentagon is incapable of doing what needs to be done. The preparations for the mission to capture or kill Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, appear to have unfolded like others before it. Intelligence was received about a high-level Qaeda meeting. A small snatch or kill operation was  to be carried out by Special Operations. But military brass added large numbers of troops to conduct additional intelligence, force protection, communications and extraction work. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that point, as one senior intelligence official told this newspaper, ''The whole thing turned into the invasion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld pulled the plug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To those of us who worked in counterterrorism in the 1990s, this sequence of events feels like the movie ''Groundhog Day.'' Similar decision-making led to the failure to mount critical operations on at least three occasions during the Clinton administration. The most notable was the effort to get the Pentagon to conduct a ground operation against the Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan beginning in late 1998. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Clinton White House repeatedly requested options involving ground forces that could hunt and destroy terrorists in Afghanistan. Repeatedly, senior military officials declared such a mission ''would be Desert One,'' referring to the disastrous 1980 effort to free American hostages in Iran. When the Pentagon finally delivered a plan, the deployment envisioned would have been sufficient to take and hold Kabul but not to surprise and pin down a handful of terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Zawahri stand-down is even more telling. It occurred four years into the global war on terrorism, when the basic questions about the nature of the  Qaeda threat had been settled and the nation, in the oft-intoned phrase of the Bush administration, was said to be always ''on the offensive.'' Moreover, it happened on the watch of Donald Rumsfeld, the most dominating secretary of defense in memory, who overruled military planners routinely as he micromanaged the deployment to Iraq. Perhaps his attention was focused on the growing mess in that country, but even Mr. Rumsfeld, who viewed special forces as the keystone of a transformed 21st-century American military, could not keep on track a mission that would have stunned Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Highly mobile, highly lethal counterterrorism operations are clearly possible. Israel scored victories with raids in Entebbe, Uganda; Tunis; and Beirut, Lebanon,  in the 1970s and 1980s. Other countries, like Germany, have  carried out similar operations, like the Mogadishu raid of 1977 that freed passengers on a Lufthansa plane hijacked to Somalia by the Baader-Meinhof gang. An operation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas -- setting aside the issue of whether this could politically upend President Pervez Musharraf -- would be extremely difficult. But it is hard to believe it is impossible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the Desert One debacle, the United States has poured vast resources into its special forces. The Special Operations Command budget has nearly doubled since 2001, and it is expected to grow 150 percent over five years. The command includes more than 50,000 troops, the equivalent of three or four infantry divisions. The best of them -- Delta Force and the Navy Seals -- have developed into highly skilled unconventional forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet fear of failure and casualties has meant they are seldom, if ever, deployed for such counterterrorism operations. In theory, the best place in the government for small-scale missions to be planned and executed is the Pentagon, because snatch or kill teams should be plugged into a larger military support team. The reality, unfortunately, is that they can't be plugged in without being bogged down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior officers, trained to understand the American way of war to mean overwhelming force and superior firepower, view special ops outside  a war zone as something to be avoided at all cost. This has been true even in lower-risk efforts to capture war criminals in the Balkans. The record demonstrates that our military is simply incapable of adapting its culture to embrace such operations. The Pentagon should just stop planning for missions it won't launch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the C.I.A. doesn't have an unblemished record, its counterterrorism operations have shown more promise than the Pentagon's. The agency has already had some successes operating in ungoverned spaces. In the first reported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in such a region, a C.I.A.-operated Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched a missile that killed a Qaeda lieutenant in Yemen in 2002. Since then the Predator has been used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al Qaeda at least eight times, although with limited success. At least initially, the trigger in these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was pulled by C.I.A. operatives, not soldiers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The record of a small, vulnerable C.I.A. paramilitary force in Afghanistan in 2001 was more impressive. The group's audacious reconnaissance work and direction of local warlords in action against the Taliban provided the most significant battlefield success of the post-9/11 period. Without this risky, cold-start intervention, the American troops that followed the agency into Afghanistan would have gone in blind and worried more about their flanks than about Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The agency's history of ill-conceived covert political operations from the 1950s through the 1970s may cause some to worry. That agency, however, no longer exists. Congressional hearings and legislation, as well as fear of casualties, have given the clandestine service its own case of risk aversion, though it seems less severe than the Pentagon's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have failed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and are failing in Iraq, to achieve a primary aim of our counterterrorism policy: preventing Al Qaeda from acquiring safe havens. Our military has shown itself to be a poor instrument for fighting terrorism, and there are now thousands of jihadists who weren't in Iraq at the time of the 2003 invasion. When the inevitable American drawdown occurs, we will need a way to keep the terrorists off balance in Iraq and to disrupt the conveyor belt that is already moving fighters to places like Lebanon, North Africa and Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With new leadership at both the C.I.A. and the Defense Department, the Bush administration has a chance to fix this problem. The missing ingredient for success with the most important kind of counterterrorism missions is not courage or technical capacity -- our uniformed personnel are unsurpassed -- but organizational culture. With a small fraction of the resources that Pentagon has for special operations, the C.I.A. could develop the paramilitary capacity we profoundly need. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has used </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on militants in the area in the past, but in Washington, a Pentagon spokesman denied that the American military was involved in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reuters reported. A spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency, which operates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well, declined to comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile killed the militants inside a compound near a large madrasa, or religious school, that was established by Jalaluddin Haqqani, a Taliban commander with close ties to Osama bin Laden, the security official said. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place in a village outside Miran Shah, the administrative center of the North Waziristan tribal area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The compound served as a safe house for Islamic fighters crossing between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and was owned by a militant leader from Waziristan, according to the official. Villagers said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had fired two missiles, one that exploded inside the compound and another that failed to detonate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have denied operating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but after previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> local residents and militants have produced missile fragments with American markings. Some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed senior militants, while others have killed large numbers of civilians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haqqani met Mr. bin Laden when the two men fought Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan as part of an American-backed resistance effort during the 1980s. He served as a senior official in the Taliban government before fleeing to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With speculation rampant that he is in poor health, American military officials believe his son, Sirajuddin, now leads his network of fighters, who are active in eastern Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- After the United States has spent more than $5 billion in a largely failed effort to bolster the Pakistani military effort against  Al Qaeda and the Taliban, some American officials now acknowledge that there were too few controls over  the money. The strategy to improve the Pakistani military, they said, needs to be completely revamped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews in Islamabad and Washington, Bush administration and military officials said they believed that much of the American money was not making its way to frontline Pakistani units. Money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems designed to counter India, not Al Qaeda or the Taliban, the officials said, adding that the United States has paid tens of millions of dollars in inflated Pakistani reimbursement claims for fuel, ammunition and other costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I personally believe there is exaggeration and inflation,'' said a senior American military official who has reviewed the program, referring to Pakistani requests for reimbursement. ''Then, I point back to the United States and say we didn't have to give them money this way.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials say they are incensed at what they see as American ingratitude for Pakistani counterterrorism efforts that have left about 1,000 Pakistani soldiers and police officers dead. They deny that any overcharging has occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The $5 billion was provided through a program known as Coalition Support Funds, which reimburses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for conducting military operations to fight terrorism. Under a separate program, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> receives $300 million per year in traditional American military financing that pays for equipment and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civilian opponents of President Pervez Musharraf say he used the reimbursements to prop up his government. One European diplomat in Islamabad said the United States should have been more cautious with its aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I wonder if the Americans have not been taken for a ride,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawmakers in Washington voted Thursday to put restrictions on the $300 million in military financing, and withheld $50 million of that money until Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice certifies that Islamabad has been  restoring democratic rights since Mr. Musharraf lifted a state of emergency on Dec. 16. The measure had little effect on the far larger Coalition Support Funds reimbursements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While it was a modest first step, any new conditions in aid could have a major effect on relations between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military relies on Washington for roughly a quarter of its entire $4 billion budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews, American and Pakistani officials acknowledged that they had never agreed on the strategic goals that should drive how the money was spent, or how the Pakistanis would prove that they were performing up to American expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Six Years, a Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early last week, six years after President Bush first began pouring billions of dollars into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, 2001, the Pentagon completed a review that produced a classified plan to help the Pakistani military build an effective counterinsurgency force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plan, which now goes to the United States Embassy in Islamabad to carry out, seeks to focus American military aid toward specific equipment and training for Pakistani forces operating in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas where Qaeda leaders and local militants hold sway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For their part, Pakistani officials angrily accused the United States of refusing to sell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the advanced helicopters, reconnaissance aircraft, radios and night-vision equipment it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There have been many aspects of equipment that we've been keen on getting,'' said Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad, the Pakistani military's chief spokesman. ''There have been many delays which have hampered this war against extremists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States military officials said the American military was so overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan that it had no advanced helicopters to give to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. American law also restricts the export of sophisticated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> night-vision goggles and other equipment for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is at least one area of agreement. Both sides say the reimbursements have failed substantially to increase the ability of Pakistani forces to mount comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, with several billion more in aid scheduled for the coming years, American officials estimate it will take at least three to five years to train and equip large numbers of army and Frontier Corps units, a paramilitary force now battling militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't forecast any noticeable impact,'' a Defense Department official said. ''It's pretty bleak.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The program's failures appear to be a sweeping setback for the administration as it approaches its final year in office. American intelligence officials say they believe that Mr. Bush is likely to leave office in January 2009 with the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden still at large. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We haven't had a good lead on his exact whereabouts in two years,'' another senior American military official lamented recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda More Active</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This spring, American intelligence officials said  the Qaeda leaders hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas had reconstituted their command structure and become increasingly active. Backed by Al Qaeda, pro-Taliban militants have expanded their influence from the remote border regions into the more populated parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year and mounted a record number of suicide bombings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Coalition Support Funds program was intended to prevent that from happening. Under the program, Pakistani military officials submit bills and are paid for supplies, wear and tear on equipment and other costs, as well as for the American use of three Pakistani air bases, according to American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States since 2001 has deposited more than $5 billion in reimbursements into the Pakistani government's general budget account, the largest single portion of some $10 billion in aid to Islamabad in that time. Also included in that larger amount is $1.9 billion in security assistance, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has used in part to buy new radios for troops, night-vision goggles and refurbished Cobra </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials say the Coalition Support Funds money goes into the national treasury to repay the government for money already spent on 100,000 troops deployed in the tribal areas. But American military officials say the funds do not reach the men who need it. That is especially the case for helicopter maintenance and poorly equipped Frontier Corps units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During a recent visit to the border, an American official found members of the Frontier Corps ''standing there in the snow in sandals,'' according to the official. Several were wearing World War I-era pith helmets and carrying barely functional Kalashnikov rifles with just 10 rounds of ammunition apiece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is not making its way, for certain, we know, to the broader part of the armed forces which is carrying out the brunt of their operations on the border,'' the senior American military official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Members of Congress also express growing frustration with the Coalition Support Funds program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The situation in the tribal areas seems to be getting worse,  not better, and that's despite a billion dollars in aid,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee who visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in fall 2006. ''Just pouring the money in and asking them to do this is not producing the results that we need.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Complaints Over Support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most glaring example of the Coalition Support Funds program's failure is helicopter maintenance, according to both Pakistani and American officials. In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Musharraf complained specifically that a lack of American spare parts and assistance had handicapped the country's 20 refurbished Vietnam-era Cobra </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters provided by the United States.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ten days back, of 20 Cobra helicopters, we have only one that was serviceable,'' he said. ''We need more support.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews, American military officials scoffed at the statement. They said the United States had provided $8 million worth of Cobra parts in the past six months and would provide $4 million to $6 million in parts next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Washington reimbursed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $55 million for helicopter operation and maintenance costs for an eight-month period in 2007, American officials said. The United States later found out that the army received only $25 million from the Pakistani government for operations and maintenance of their entire national helicopter fleet for the whole of 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said they suspected that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been overcharging for helicopter maintenance. Yet at the same time, maintenance of Pakistani helicopters is not being performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Come March or April,'' one official said, ''I fully expect catastrophic failure of a large part of their helicopter fleet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years, how money from the Coalition Support Funds was disbursed to the Pakistani government was veiled in secrecy. The size and scope of the payments to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was held so closely that one senior American military officer in Afghanistan said that he did not know that the administration was spending $1 billion a year until he attended a meeting in Islamabad in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was astounded,'' said the officer, who would not speak for attribution because he now holds another senior military post. ''On one side of the border we were paying a billion to get very little done. On the other side of the border -- the Afghan side -- we were scrambling to find the funds to train an army that actually wanted to get something done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by mid-2007, the $1 billion-a-year figure became public, largely because of the objections of some military officials and defense experts who said  that during an ill-fated peace treaty between the military and militants in the tribal areas in 2005 and 2006, the money kept flowing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to submit receipts for reimbursement, even though Pakistani troops had stopped fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even then, however, American officials said there was little effort to rethink the purposes of the aid, or impose stricter controls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense Department officials in the United States Embassy in Islamabad check the claims and ensure the receipts are well substantiated, officials said. The Pentagon's comptroller and State Department then also certify the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dov Zakheim, who served as the Pentagon's top financial officer until 2004 and helped set up the program in late 2001, said in a telephone interview that while he was at the department, the military carefully checked whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out the operations it claimed and typically approved only 80 to 90 percent of each invoice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by July 2006, the Pentagon comptroller and Central Command were concerned enough about insufficient accountability to dispatch a team to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to lay out new requirements for more detailed invoices, a Pentagon spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And by that fall, senior military officials at the embassy in Islamabad were telling visiting American lawmakers that the support fund program needed to be revamped to pay for specific objectives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inflated Invoices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, American officials say they believe that some of the invoices are inflated by as much as 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The claims that they submit are probably in some cases exaggerated and the amounts inflated,'' said the senior American military official who had reviewed the program. ''When it comes to reimbursement for the cost of food, bunker material, barbed wire fences, those are much more susceptible to inflation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even the efforts to send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the refurbished Cobra helicopters, for instance, have cost more than expected and have fallen behind schedule. Pakistani forces have received only 12 of the 20 aircraft promised, and have been dissatisfied with the quality of them, a senior Pentagon official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One retired Pakistani military official said the American system of paying reimbursements did not allow for any forward planning. He expressed irritation that the Americans offered help, but not advanced American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopters and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which are vital for counterinsurgency in the inaccessible tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Praising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who took command after Mr. Musharraf resigned as the head of the army last month, American military officials called for a complete restructuring of American military aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They said that the United States should supply the same amount of overall military assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but also require that it be supplied under traditional military aid programs with tighter controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But they fear that members of Congress will react to the troubled reimbursement program by slashing military aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not all or nothing,'' the senior American military official said. ''You need to regulate and manage it for more benefit both to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier military intelligence agency has lost control of some of the networks of Pakistani militants it has nurtured since the 1980s, and is now suffering the violent blowback  of that policy, two former senior intelligence officials and other officials close to the agency say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the military has moved against them, the militants have turned on their former handlers, the officials said. Joining with other extremist groups, they have battled Pakistani security forces and helped militants carry out a record number of suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, including some aimed directly at army and intelligence units as well as prominent political figures, possibly even Benazir Bhutto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The growing strength of the militants, many of whom now express support for Al Qaeda's global jihad, presents a grave threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security, as well as NATO efforts to push back the Taliban in Afghanistan. American officials have begun to weigh more robust covert operations to go after Al Qaeda in the lawless border areas because they are so concerned that the Pakistani government is unable to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unusual disclosures regarding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leading military intelligence agency -- Inter-Services  Intelligence, or the ISI -- emerged in interviews last month with former senior Pakistani intelligence officials. The disclosures confirm some of the worst fears, and suspicions, of American and Western military officials and diplomats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The interviews, a rare glimpse inside a notoriously secretive and opaque agency, offered a string of other troubling insights likely to refocus attention on the ISI's role as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moves toward elections on Feb. 18 and a battle for control of the government looms: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One former senior Pakistani intelligence official, as well as other people close to the agency, acknowledged that the ISI led the effort to manipulate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last national election in 2002, and offered to drop corruption cases against candidates who would back President Pervez Musharraf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A person close to the ISI said Mr. Musharraf had now ordered the agency to ensure that the coming elections were free and fair, and denied that the agency was working to rig the vote. But the acknowledgment of past rigging is certain to fuel opposition fears of new meddling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two former high-ranking intelligence officials acknowledged that after Sept. 11, 2001, when President Musharraf publicly allied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the Bush administration, the ISI could not rein in the militants it had nurtured for decades as a proxy force to exert pressure on India and Afghanistan. After the agency unleashed hard-line Islamist beliefs, the officials said, it struggled to stop the ideology from spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another former senior intelligence official said dozens of ISI officers who trained militants had come to sympathize with their cause and had had to be expelled from the agency. He said three purges had taken place since the late 1980s and included the removal of three ISI directors suspected of being sympathetic to the militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of the former intelligence officials who spoke to The New York Times agreed to be identified when talking about the ISI, an agency that has gained a fearsome reputation for interfering in almost every aspect of Pakistani life. But two former American intelligence officials agreed with much of what they said about the agency's relationship with the militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So did other sources close to the ISI, who admitted that the agency had supported militants in Afghanistan and Kashmir, although they said they had been ordered to do so by political leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former intelligence officials appeared to feel freer to speak as Mr. Musharraf's eight years of military rule weakened, and as a power struggle for control over the government looms between Mr. Musharraf and opposition political parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials were interviewed before the assassination of Ms. Bhutto, the opposition leader, on Dec. 27. Since then, the government has said that Pakistani militants linked to Al Qaeda are the foremost suspects in her killing. Her supporters have accused the government of a hidden hand in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the author of Ms. Bhutto's death remains a mystery, the interviews with the former intelligence officials made clear that the agency remained unable to control the militants it had fostered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The threat from the militants, the former intelligence officials warned, is one that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is unable to contain. ''We could not control them,'' said one former senior intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''We indoctrinated them and told them, 'You will go to heaven.' You cannot turn it around so suddenly.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Context</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 9/11, the Bush administration pressed Mr. Musharraf to choose a side in fighting Islamist extremism and to abandon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> longtime support for the Taliban and other Islamist militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1990s, the ISI supported the militants as a proxy force to contest Indian-controlled Kashmir, the border territory that India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> both claim, and to gain a controlling influence in neighboring Afghanistan. In the 1980s, the United States supported militants, too, funneling billions of dollars to Islamic fighters battling Soviet forces in Afghanistan through the ISI, vastly increasing the agency's size and power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Publicly, Mr. Musharraf agreed to reverse course in 2001, and he has received $10 billion in aid for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since then in return. In an interview in November, he vehemently defended the conduct of the ISI, an agency that, according to American officials, was under his firm control for the last eight years while he served as both president and army chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Musharraf dismissed criticism of the ISI's relationship with the militants. He cited the deaths of 1,000 Pakistani soldiers and police officers in battles with the militants in recent years -- as well as several assassination attempts against himself -- as proof of the seriousness of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> counterterrorism effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is quite illogical if you think those people who have suffered 1,000 people dead, and I who have been attacked thrice or four or five times, that I would be supportive towards Taliban, towards Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Musharraf said. ''These are ridiculous things that discourages and demoralizes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some former American intelligence officials have argued that Mr. Musharraf and the ISI never fully jettisoned their militant proteges, and instead carried on a ''double-game.'' They say Mr. Musharraf cooperated with American intelligence agencies to track down foreign Qaeda members while holding Taliban commanders and Kashmiri militants in reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In order to undercut major opposition parties, he wooed religious conservatives, according to analysts. And instead of carrying out a crackdown, Mr. Musharraf took half-measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think he would make a decision when a situation arises,'' said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a leading Pakistani military analyst, referring to militants openly confronting the government. ''But before that he would not alienate any side.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is little dispute that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crackdown on the militants has been at best uneven, but key sources interviewed by The Times disagreed on why. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most Western officials in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say they believe, as Pakistani officials, including President Musharraf, insist, that the agency is well disciplined, like the army, and is in no sense a rogue or out-of-control organization acting contrary to the policies of the leadership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Western military official in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that if the ISI was covertly aiding the Taliban, the decision would come from the top of the government, not the agency. ''That's not an ISI decision,'' the official said. ''That's a government-of-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But former Pakistani intelligence officials insisted that Mr. Musharraf had ordered a crackdown on all militants. It was never fully carried out, however, because of opposition within his government and within ISI, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One former senior intelligence official said that some officials in the government and the ISI thought the militants should be held in reserve, as insurance against the day when American and NATO forces abandoned the region and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might again need them as a lever against India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We had a school of thought that favored retention of this capability,'' the former senior intelligence official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some senior ministers and officials in Mr. Musharraf's government sympathized with the militants and protected them, former intelligence officials said. Still others advised a go-slow approach, fearing a backlash against the government from the militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When arrests were ordered, the police refused to carry them out in some cases until they received written orders, believing the militants were still protected by the ISI, as they had been for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside the ISI, there was division as well. One part of the ISI hunted down militants, the officials said, while another continued to work with them. The result was confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews in 2002, Kashmiri militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said they had been told by the government to maintain a low profile and wait. But as Pakistani military operations in the tribal areas intensified, along with airstrikes by C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militant groups there issued highly charged and sometimes exaggerated accounts of women and children being killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first suicide bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a military target outside the tribal areas came days after an airstrike on a madrasa in the tribal area of Bajaur in October 2006 killed scores of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another turning point came last July when Pakistani forces stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad, where militants  had armed themselves in a compound less than a mile from ISI headquarters and demanded the imposition of Islamic law. Government officials said that more than 100 people died. The militants have insisted that thousands did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several weeks later, militants carried out the first direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on ISI employees. Suicide bombers twice attacked buses ferrying agency employees, killing 18 on Sept. 4 and 15 more on Nov. 24. According to Pakistani analysts, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signaled that enraged militants had turned on their longtime patrons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Militant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One militant leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, typifies how extremists once trained by the ISI have broken free of the agency's control, turned against the government and joined with other militants to create powerful new networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2000, Mr. Azhar received support from the ISI when he founded Jaish-e-Muhammad, or Army of Muhammad, a Pakistani militant group fighting Indian forces in Kashmir, according to Robert Grenier, who served as the Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Islamabad from 1999 to 2002. The ISI intermittently provided training and operational coordination to such groups, he said, but struggled to fully control them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Musharraf banned Jaish-e-Muhammad and detained Mr. Azhar  after militants carried out an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Indian Parliament building in December 2001. Indian officials accused Jaish-e-Muhammad and another Pakistani militant group of masterminding the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After India massed hundreds of thousands of troops on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, Mr. Musharraf vowed in a nationally televised speech that January to crack down on all militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will take strict action against any Pakistani who is involved in terrorism inside the country or abroad,'' he said. Two weeks later, a British-born member of Mr. Azhar's group, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, kidnapped Daniel Pearl, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who was beheaded by his captors. Mr. Sheikh surrendered to the ISI, the agency that had supported Jaish-e-Muhammad, and was sentenced to death for the kidnapping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Pearl's killing, Pakistani officials arrested more than 2,000 people in a crackdown. But within a year, Mr. Azhar and most of the 2,000 militants who had been arrested were freed. ''I never believed that government ties with these groups was being irrevocably cut,'' said Mr. Grenier, now a managing director at Kroll, a risk consulting firm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemingly went ''through the motions'' when it came to hunting Taliban leaders who fled into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Encouraged by the United States, the Pakistanis focused their resources on arresting senior Qaeda members, he said, which they successfully did from 2002 to 2005. Since then, arrests have slowed as Al Qaeda and other militant groups have become more entrenched in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked in 2006 why the Pakistani government did not move against the leading Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, and his son Sirajuddin, who are based in the tribal areas and have long had links with Al Qaeda, one senior ISI official said it was because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needed to retain some assets of its own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That policy haunts Mr. Musharraf and the United States, according to American and Pakistani analysts. Today </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas are host to a lethal stew of foreign Qaeda members, Uzbek militants, Taliban, ISI-trained Pakistani extremists, disgruntled tribesmen and new recruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The groups carried out a record number of suicide bombings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan last year and have been tied to three major terrorist plots in Britain and Germany since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Azhar, who once served his ISI mentors in Kashmir, is thought to be hiding in the tribal area of Bajaur, or nearby Dir, and fighting Pakistani security forces, according to one former intelligence official. Militants who took part in the Red Mosque siege in Islamabad in July were closely affiliated with Mr. Azhar's group. This fall, his group fielded fighters in the Swat Valley, the famous tourist spot, where the militants presented a challenge of new proportions to the government, seizing several districts and mounting battles against Pakistani forces that left scores dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One militant from a banned sectarian group who joined Mr. Azhar's group, Qari Zafar, now trains insurgents in South Waziristan on how to rig roadside bombs and vests for suicide bombings, according to the former intelligence official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cooperation against the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan has improved since 2006, and three senior Taliban figures have been caught, according to Western officials and sources close to the ISI. Yet doubts remain about the Pakistani government's intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior provincial ISI officials continue to meet with high-level members of the Taliban in the border provinces, according to one Western diplomat. ''It is not illogical to surmise that cooperation is on the agenda, and not just debriefing,'' the diplomat said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are groups they know they have lost control of,'' the Western diplomat added. But the government moved only against those groups that have attacked the Pakistani state, the diplomat said, adding, ''It seems very difficult for them to write them off.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Agency Now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western officials say that before Mr. Musharraf resigned as army chief in December, he appointed a loyalist to run the ISI and appears determined to retain power over the agency even as a civilian president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For as long as he can, Musharraf will keep trying to control these organizations,'' a Western diplomat said. ''I don't think we should expect this man to become an elder statesman as we know it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That puts Mr. Musharraf's successor as army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who headed the ISI from 2004 to 2007, in a potentially pivotal position. General Kayani, a pro-American moderate, is loyal to Mr. Musharraf to a point, according to retired officers. But he will abandon him if he thinks Mr. Musharraf's actions are significantly undermining the standing of the Pakistani army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Musharraf will maintain control over the agency as long as his interests coincide with General Kayani's, they said, while the new civilian prime minister who emerges from February's elections is likely to have far less authority over the agency. Opposition political parties already accuse the agency of meddling in next month's election. The Western diplomat called the ISI ''the army's dirty bag of tricks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since Ms. Bhutto's assassination, members of her party have accused government officials, including former ISI agents, of having a hidden hand in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or of knowing about a plot and failing to inform Ms. Bhutto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American experts played down the chances of a government conspiracy against Ms. Bhutto. They also said it was unlikely that low-level or retired officers working alone or with militants carried out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But nearly half of Pakistanis said in a recent poll that they suspected that government agencies or pro-government politicians had assassinated Ms. Bhutto. Such suspicion stems from decades of interference in elections and politics by the ISI, according to analysts, as well as a high level of domestic surveillance, intimidation and threats to journalists, academics and human rights activists, which former intelligence officials also acknowledged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani and American experts say that distrust speaks to the urgent need to reform a hugely powerful intelligence agency that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military rulers have used for decades to suppress political opponents, manipulate elections and support militant groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would certainly be better off if the ISI were never used for domestic political purposes,'' said Mr. Grenier, the former C.I.A. Islamabad station chief. ''That goes without saying.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani analysts and Western diplomats argue that the country will remain unstable as long as the ISI remains so powerful and so unaccountable. The ISI has grown more powerful in each period of military rule, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civilian leaders, including Mrs. Bhutto, could not resist using it to secure their political aims, but neither could they control it. And the army continues to rely on the ISI for its own foreign policy aims, particularly battling India in Kashmir and seeking influence in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The question is, how do you change that?'' asked one Western diplomat. ''Their tentacles are everywhere.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For centuries, fighting and lawlessness have been part of the fabric of this frontier city. But in the past year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war with Islamic militants has spilled right into its alleys and bazaars, its forts and armories, killing policemen and soldiers and scaring its famously tough citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is a sense of siege here, as the Islamic insurgency pours out of the adjacent tribal region into this city, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest, and its surrounding districts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban and their militant sympathizers now hold strategic pockets on the city's outskirts, the police say, from where they </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the military and the police, order schoolgirls to wear the burqa and blow up stores selling DVDs, among other acts of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suicide bombings, bomb explosions and missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred an average of once a week here in 2007, according to a tally by the city's police department. In 2006, while there were occasional grenade </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and explosions, the authorities did not record a single suicide bombing or rocket </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The proximity of Peshawar to the tribal areas where the Taliban and Al Qaeda have regrouped in the past two years makes the city a feasible prize for the militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quickly escalating internal strife that pits the Islamic extremists against the American-backed government of President Pervez Musharraf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though few here believe that the Taliban will rule anytime soon, the police and residents say that by the standards of counterinsurgency warfare the extremists are doing well. They have undermined public faith in the government, sown distrust and made the police fearful for their lives. ''People feel the insecurity is so high, no one can fix it,'' said Humair Bilour, the sister-in-law of Malik Saad, a popular Peshawar police chief who was killed in a suicide bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year. ''How can the government do anything when the government itself is involved in it?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She said she and her friends were now afraid to go out. ''People go to the bazaar and make jokes: 'Is this going to be my last trip?'&lt;0&gt;'' she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The extremists have selected the police and the army, two important pillars of the Pakistani state, as particular targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, rockets were fired at an army barracks in Warsak on the city's perimeter, a warning of the power of the militants to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Mohmand, a district in the tribal areas adjacent to Peshawar, an area that a few months ago was considered free of the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army headquarters in the center of the city were struck last month by a bomber who was hiding explosives under her burqa that were set off by remote control. The assassination a year ago of the police chief, Mr. Saad, who was killed while on duty trying to control a religious procession in one of the bazaars, shook the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's asymmetrical warfare against an established state,'' said Muhammad Sulaman Khan, chief of operations for the Peshawar police and a close friend of Mr. Saad. ''The terrorists only don't have to lose it, we need to win it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the core of the troubles here, many say, lie demands by the United States that the Pakistani military, generously financed by Washington, join in its campaign against terrorism, which means killing fellow Pakistanis in the tribal areas. Even if those Pakistanis are extremists, the people here say, they do not like a policy of killing fellow tribesmen, and fellow countrymen, particularly on behalf of the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush administration is convinced that Al Qaeda and the Taliban have gained new strength in the past two years, particularly in the tribal regions of North and South Waziristan and Bajaur. It has said it is considering sending American forces to help the Pakistani soldiers in those areas. Mr. Musharraf has scoffed at the idea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any direct intervention by American forces would only strengthen the backlash now under way against soldiers and the police in Peshawar, said Farook Adam Khan, a lawyer here. That reaction spread last week to Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, where a suicide bomber killed almost two dozen policemen at a lawyers' rally, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Pakistani soldiers never used to be targets,'' Mr. Khan said. ''Now we have the radicals antagonized by Musharraf and his politics of cozying up to the United States. The actions taken by the army in Waziristan and Bajaur and Swat are causing the problems here.'' Swat is an area 100 miles north of Peshawar, where the Pakistani Army is currently battling a Pakistani Taliban insurgent group with mixed results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The standing of the Pakistani military is being further harmed by an increasing awareness here that it is for the first time suffering significant numbers of defections, mostly among soldiers reluctant to fight in the tribal areas. The defections gain only scant mention in the press, but people talk about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are rumors of courts-martial, although the information is tightly held by the army, former officers said. Morale among the police in Peshawar has plummeted amid a series of police killings, making the city far from the glamorous posting it once was, when the police were fighting smugglers and other outlaws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Terrorist activities around Peshawar began to increase, Mr. Khan said, after a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a madrasa in Bajaur in October 2006, in which 82 people, including 12 teenagers, were killed. The Pakistani Army said intelligence had shown that the madrasa was used as a training base by Al Qaeda. Local residents said the killings were the work of an American remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a charge that Washington denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few months later, government schools for girls around Peshawar began to receive threats that they would be blown up if the students did not wear burqas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one such school, in Shah Dhand Baba, a town on the northern fringes of Peshawar, the principal, Gul Bahar Begum, said she received a handwritten letter in the mail last February demanding that the students cover up or the school would be blown up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Begum, who wears lipstick and lightly covers her hair with a scarf, and whose office is filled with sports trophies won by her students, said that about 70 percent of the girls now wore burqas when they stepped outside the school. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is the Islamic way to cover,'' she said of her instructions to the girls to cover up. ''So the militants were right, but the way they imposed their decision was not.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The students, dressed in  loose white pants and long shirts, suggested that they accepted the demands because they had to, not because they believed it was a religious necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maryam Sultan, 16, who wore a denim jacket over her uniform, said she and her friends came to school in burqas ''for security.'' Ms. Sultan, who was more interested in talking about her desire to become a doctor, said there was little choice but to cover up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The outward bravura at the school masked a deeper problem: the inability of the police or any other authorities to deter the militants. At another school where a threatening letter was received, the principal protested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She made contact with the militants, saying that burqas were too expensive for some of the girls. The militants replied, saying, ''If the girls can afford makeup, they can afford burqas,'' according to officials in the district. Days later, the girls were in burqas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Himayat Mayar, the local mayor, blamed the government for the threats against the girls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that during the five years that Mr. Musharraf and his allies in a coalition of Islamic parties, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, had governed the North-West Frontier Province, they had allowed madrasas for young Islamic jihadists to flourish. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are so many madrasas run by mullahs that train jihadis and get funds from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,'' Mr. Mayar said. ''These jihadists know only jihad. They should be brought into the mainstream.'' If it wanted to, he added, the government could easily provide teachers and computers to the madrasas, and register them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Peshawar's booming business in illicit Western and Indian DVDs has been another target of the militants. Many of the city's myriad retail outlets have closed after being bombed, or threatened with violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Bilal DVD Parlor, the owners, Bilal Javed and Akhtar Ali, said their sales -- ranging  from ''Pride and Prejudice'' to ''Die Hard 4.0,'' to the latest Bollywood films and old Bruce Lee movies -- had fallen by 90 percent. Their decade-old wholesale business in the tribal region was finished, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a recent day, their modern retail store, fitted with polished chrome, was packed floor to ceiling with DVDs. There were no customers. They said people had been afraid to shop there since a bomb hidden in a water cooler exploded at a DVD store across the street last year, killing five people, including a 7-year-old boy who wanted to buy a computer mouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The police chief said, 'We can't secure ourselves, how can we secure you?'&lt;0&gt;'' Mr. Javed said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE TUMBLED OUT of two Black Hawks onto a shrub-dusted mountainside. It was    a windy, cold October evening. A half-moon illuminated the tall pines and peaks.    Through night-vision goggles the soldiers and landscape glowed in a blurry green-and-white    static. Just across the valley, lights flickered from a few homes nestled in    the terraced farmlands of Yaka China,    a notorious village in the Korengal River valley in Afghanistan's    northeastern province of Kunar. Yaka China was just a few villages south and    around a bend in the river from the Americans' small mountain outposts,    but the area's reputation among the soldiers was mythic. It was a known    safe haven for insurgents. American troops have tended to avoid the place since    a nasty fight a year or so earlier. And as Halloween approached, the soldiers    I was with, under the command of 26-year-old Capt. Dan Kearney, were predicting    their own Yaka China doom. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Korengal Valley is a lonely outpost of regress: most of the valley's people practice Wahhabism, a more rigid variety of Islam than that followed by most Afghans, and about half of the fighters confronting the U.S. there are homegrown. The rest are Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens, Uzbeks; the area is close to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> frontier regions where Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other Al Qaeda figures are often said to be hiding out. The Korengal fighters are fierce, know the terrain and watch the Americans' every move. On their hand-held radios, the old jihadis call the Americans ''monkeys,'' ''infidels,'' ''bastards'' and ''the kids.'' It's psychological warfare; they know the Americans monitor their radio chatter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As far as ''the kids'' are concerned, the insurgents are ghosts -- so the soldiers' tactics often come down to using themselves as bait. The insurgents specialize in ambushes, harassing fire and hit-and-run </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO's military advantage in such a war is air power. The soldiers don't hesitate to call in Big Daddy (who, in today's military, often flies in with the voice of a female pilot). But while these flying war machines are saviors to the soldiers, they cannot distinguish between insurgents and civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I went to Afghanistan last fall with a question: Why, with all our technology, were we killing so many civilians in air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of September of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, NATO was causing alarmingly high numbers of civilian deaths -- 350 by the coalition, compared with 438 by the insurgents. The sheer tonnage of metal raining down on Afghanistan was mind-boggling: a million pounds between January and September of 2007, compared with half a million in all of 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a few days, the first question sparked more: Was there a deeper problem in the counterinsurgency campaign? More than 100 American soldiers were killed last year, the highest rate since the invasion. Why were so many more American troops being killed? To find out, I spent much of the fall in the Korengal Valley and elsewhere in Kunar province alongside soldiers who were making life-and-death decisions almost every day -- decisions that led to the deaths of soldiers and of civilians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Subduing the Valley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OVER THE LAST two years, the Americans have steadily increased their presence    in Kunar province, fanning out to the small platoon-size outposts that have    become the signature of the new counterinsurgency doctrine in both Afghanistan    and Iraq.    The Korengal Outpost, nicknamed the KOP, was built in April 2006 on the site    of a former timber mill and motel. The soldiers of Battle Company of the 173rd    Airborne Brigade Combat Team live there in dusty tents and little wooden huts.    They now have hot food and a small chow tent with an Internet linkup and a few    phones for calling home. But the place was protected by not much more than concertina    wire and sentries. Nearly every time I arrived at the KOP our helicopter was    greeted by sniper fire or the dushka -- a Russian-made antiaircraft    gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dan Kearney was essentially lord of the Korengal Valley. A self-described Georgia army brat, he grew up idolizing his warrior dad, Frank Kearney, and wanted to move in his father's world of covert and overt operations. (His father is now a lieutenant general in Special Operations command.) Kearney often calls himself a dumb jock, playing the crass, loudmouthed tough guy with his soldiers. He had been in Iraq and told me he had gone emotionally dead there with all the dying and killing, and stayed that way until the birth of his son a year ago. His hardest day in Iraq was when a close friend, Rob Shaw, was severely wounded by an improvised explosive device that killed his first sergeant and a bunch of their friends -- and the next thing he knew their colonel was asking Kearney to step in for Shaw and lead the company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as hard as Iraq was, he said, nothing was as tough as the Korengal. Unlike in Iraq, where the captains and lieutenants could let down their guard in a relatively safe, fortified operating base, swapping stories and ideas, here they had no one to talk to and were almost as vulnerable to enemy fire inside the wire as out. Last summer, insurgents stormed one of the bases in a nearby valley and wounded 16. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And unlike every other place I've been in Afghanistan -- even the Pech River valley, just an hour's drive away -- the Korengal had no Afghan police or district leaders for the Americans to work with. The Afghan government, and Afghans down the valley, seemed to have washed their hands of the Korengalis. As Kearney put it to me one day at the KOP, the Korengal is like a tough Los Angeles neighborhood, ''and we're the L.A.P.D. kicking in the door, arresting guys, demanding information about the gangs, and slowly the people say, 'No, we don't know anything, because that guy in the gang, he's with my sister, and that other guy, he's my uncle's cousin.' Now we've angered them for so many years that they've decided: 'I'm gonna stick with the A.C.M.' '' -- anticoalition militants -- '' 'who are my brothers and I'm not gonna rat them out.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So what exactly was his job out here? To subdue the valley. It's a task the Marines had tried, and then the soldiers of the Army's 10th Mountain Division -- a task so bloody it seemed to drive the 10th Mountain's soldiers to a kind of madness. Kearney's soldiers told me they'd been spooked by the weird behavior of their predecessors last May: near the end of their tour, many would sit alone on the fire base talking to themselves. Privates disobeyed their sergeants, and squad leaders refused to step outside the wire to show the new boys the terrain. No one wanted to be shot in the last days of his tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney kept his soldiers on a tight leash at first. Col. John Nicholson, a brigade commander with the 10th Mountain Division, had promised the Afghans he would not bomb their homes. When Kearney and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team officially took over from the division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team on June 5, they kept that promise. ''My guys would tell me they didn't know which houses they're shooting from, and I'd tell them they can't shoot back into the villages,'' Kearney recalled. ''They hated me.'' The insurgents were testing the new captain, he suspected, by deliberately shooting from homes. On July 10, the Korengalis ambushed his soldiers from one house they often used -- a three-story mansion on a fertile outcropping, with balconies overlooking the valley, that belonged to Haji Matin, a timber baron turned insurgent leader. It had been the scene of fighting in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Kearney's moment of decision came, two of 2nd Platoon's sergeants, Kevin Rice and Tanner Stichter, had been shot, and the fight was still going on. Kearney could see a woman and child in the house. ''We saw people moving weapons around,'' Kearney told me. ''I tried everything. I fired mortars to the back side to get the kids to run out the front. I shot to the left, to the right. The Apache'' -- an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopter -- ''got shot at and left. I kept asking for a bomb drop, but no one wanted to sign off on the collateral damage of dropping a bomb on a house.'' Finally, he said, ''We shot a javelin and a tow'' -- both armor-piercing missiles. ''I didn't get shot at from there for two months,'' Kearney said. ''I ended up killing that woman and that kid.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney could often sound cold-blooded, like when he'd march into the mess tent in shorts, improvising rap lyrics about killing bad guys. But then he'd switch to counselor, trying to salvage a soldier's marriage, or he'd joke with a Korengali elder about arranging a marriage between his own infant son and the elder's daughter to make peace. The performances steeled him against shouldering so much mortality. As he put it, ''The only reason anyone's listening to me in this valley right now is 'cause I'm dropping bombs on them.'' Still, he wasn't going to let himself shoot at houses every time his unit took fire: ''I'd just create more people that hate me.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Blood Feud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN LATE 2001, the B-52 symbolized, for many Afghans, liberation from Taliban    rule. They wove images of the plane into their carpets. Urban legends sprang    up about the B-52's power, how the planes glided along unscathed, even    as the Taliban barraged them with antiaircraft fire. Kabulis spread the story    that the B-52s had dropped thousands of leaflets saying, ''Hit us if you    can!'' -- and afterward the Taliban didn't waste their bullets    on the B-52s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the jets that defeated the Taliban were wiping out innocent families as well. In July 2002, Special Forces in the mountains of Oruzgan thought they were destroying a high-value Taliban target, but instead they rocketed and bombed an engagement party. About 40 Afghans were killed and nearly 100 were wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such mistakes have continued, though the causes can change. The insurgents regularly use civilians as shields, children as spotters and women as food suppliers. NATO killing civilians is great propaganda for the Taliban. At the same time, to Afghans with little technological sophistication, the scale and impersonality make the accidents seem intentional. Many are convinced the Americans are deliberately bombing them and even deliberately aiding a Taliban comeback. The reality is that bombs are only as accurate as the intelligence on the ground -- and since 9/11, the U.S. and NATO have used air power as a substitute for ground troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By now, seven years of air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and civilian casualties, humiliating house searches and arbitrary detentions have pushed many families and tribes to revenge. The Americans then see every Afghan in those pockets of recalcitrance as an enemy. If you peel back the layers, however, there's always a local political story at the root of the killing and dying. That original misunderstanding and grievance fertilizes the land for the Islamists. Whom do you want to side with: your brothers in God's world or the infidel thieves? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the case of the Korengal Valley, the story began about a century ago, when the tribesmen now known as Korengalis were kicked out of the province of Nuristan (immediately north of Kunar province) and settled in the Korengal, which was rich with timber forests and farmland. Over time they made an alliance with one branch of the large Safi tribe, which once dominated Kunar politics. But down the road along the Pech River valley, the rest of the Safis opposed the Korengalis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the Afghans tell the story, from the moment the Americans arrived in 2001, the Pech Valley timber lords and warlords had their ear. Early on, they led the Americans to drop bombs on the mansion of their biggest rival -- Haji Matin. The air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed several members of his family, according to local residents, and the Americans arrested others and sent them to the prison at Bagram Air Base. The Pech Valley fighters working alongside the Americans then pillaged the mansion. And that was that. Haji Matin, already deeply religious, became ideological and joined with Abu Ikhlas, a local Arab linked to the foreign jihadis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 2007, the Americans understood what happened. Last year, the governor of Nuristan even sat them down with the Korengali elders to try and mediate between the two sides. Nothing came of it. Kearney tried to dig deeper, sending e-mail messages to anthropologists and Afghan experts to get their guidance. He spent hours listening to Haji Zalwar Khan -- who acted as the valley's representative to the Americans and the government -- talk about history and grievances. Haji Zalwar, a jihadi veteran of the anti-Soviet fight, bore the valley's burden almost alone and had the grim demeanor to prove it. Kearney met as many villagers as possible to learn the names of all the elders and their families. But he inherited a blood feud between the Korengalis and the Americans that he hadn't started, and he was being sucked into its logic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Serious P.T.S.D.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LAST AUTUMN,, after five months of grueling foot patrols up and down the mountains,    after fruitless encounters with elders who smiled in the morning and were host    to insurgents in the evening and after losing friends to enemy fire, Captain    Kearney's men could relate to the sullen, jittery rage of their predecessors    in the 10th Mountain Division. Many wondered what they were doing out there    at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney refused to entertain that thought. He would tell his visitors, whether generals or reconstruction teams, that his campaign plan was clear, if modest: ''It's World War II Pacific-island hopping, turning one village at a time.'' Over five months, he had gained about 400 yards of terrain. When some generals and colonels had flown in for a quick tour, and Kearney was showing them the lay of the land, one officer said to another, as Kearney later recalled it, ''I don't know why we're even out here.'' Another officer jumped in to talk up the logic of the operation. Kearney told me he thought: Sort your stuff out before you come out here. My boys are sucking it up and dying. . . . For besides being lord of the valley, he had another role to play -- motivator, disciplinarian and confidant to his soldiers. ''It's like being in charge of a soap opera,'' he told me. ''I feel like Dr. Phil with guns.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One full-moon night I was sitting outside a sandbag-reinforced hut with Kearney when a young sergeant stepped out hauling the garbage. He looked around at the illuminated mountains, the dust, the rocks, the garbage bin. The monkeys were screeching. ''I hate this country!'' he shouted. Then he smiled and walked back into the hut. ''He's on medication,'' Kearney said quietly to me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then another soldier walked by and shouted, ''Hey, I'm with you, sir!'' and Kearney said to me, ''Prozac. Serious P.T.S.D. from last tour.'' Another one popped out of the HQ cursing and muttering. ''Medicated,'' Kearney said. ''Last tour, if you didn't give him information, he'd burn down your house. He killed so many people. He's checked out.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As I went to get some hot chocolate in the dining tent, the peaceful night was shattered by mortars, rockets and machine-gun fire banging and bursting around us. It was a coordinated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on all the fire bases. It didn't take long to understand why so many soldiers were taking antidepressants. The soldiers were on a 15-month tour that included just 18 days off. Many of them were ''stop-lossed,'' meaning their contracts were extended because the army is stretched so thin. You are not allowed to refuse these extensions. And they felt eclipsed by Iraq. As Sgt. Erick Gallardo put it: ''We don't get supplies, assets. We scrounge for everything and live a lot more rugged. But we know the war is here. We got unfinished business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For sanity, all they had was the medics' tent, video games and movies -- ''Gladiator,'' ''Conan the Barbarian,'' ''Dogma,'' Monty Python. Down the road in the Pech Valley, soldiers played cricket with Afghan kids and had organized boxing and soccer matches. Lt. Kareem Hernandez, a New Yorker running a base on the Pech River, regularly bantered over dinner with the Afghan police. Neighbors would come by with tips. But here in the Korengal, the soldiers were completely alienated from the local culture. One night while watching a scene from HBO's ''Rome'' in which a Roman soldier tells a slave he wants to marry her, a soldier asked which century the story was set in. ''First B.C. or A.D.,'' said another soldier. The first shook his head: ''And they're still living like this 800 meters outside the wire.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of the summer, Kearney told his dad, ''My boys are gonna go crazy out here.'' The army sent a shrink, and Kearney got a wake-up call about his own leadership. He discovered that half his men thought he was playing Russian roulette with their lives and the other half thought he stuck too closely to the rules of engagement. ''The moral compass of the army is the P.L. and the C.O.'' -- the platoon leader and the commanding officer, Kearney told me. ''I told every one of my P.L.'s that they have to set that moral standard, that once you slip to the left, you can't pull your guys back in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Operation Rock Avalanche</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ON OCT. 19, Kearney and Battle Company were air assaulted into the insurgents'    backyard for a mission that many thought insane. It was called Rock Avalanche    and would last about six days. One of its main targets was the village of Yaka    China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney, being the good soldier, tried to pump up his boys with the promise that they would be going after insurgents who had killed their friends and whose grizzled faces were plastered on their bad-guy family-tree wall at the KOP. They would upset the guerrillas' safe haven and their transit routes from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They would persuade the villagers to stop harboring the bad guys by offering an $11 million road project that had just been approved by NATO and Kabul and would be built by the Kunar Provincial Reconstruction Team. And they'd complete the ''human terrain mapping'' that is part of the new counterinsurgency doctrine -- what families dominate, who's married, who's feuding, are there divisions to be exploited? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a lot to ask of young soldiers: play killer, cultural anthropologist, hearts-and-minds winner and then killer again. Which is why, just hours before the mission was to begin, some soldiers were smearing black-and-green war paint on their faces when their sergeant shouted: ''Take it off. Now!'' Why? They'd frighten the villagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It seemed a moot point as Rock Avalanche got under way. Apache gunships were scanning the ridges for insurgents. Other helicopters were dropping off more soldiers. An unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was whining overhead as it sent infrared video feeds to a large screen back at the battalion's headquarters, Camp Blessing, six miles north of the KOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost immediately, high on a mountainside looking down on Yaka China, Kearney had to play God. In a ditch to his left, Jesse Yarnell, a young intelligence officer, along with John, an Afghan interpreter, were intercepting insurgents on their two-way radios saying, ''We see them, we're going to wait.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're right down there!'' said Kevin Caroon as he gazed out of his night vision. Caroon, from Connecticut and a father of two, was an Air Force JTAC -- the joint terminal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> controller who talks the combat pilots onto their targets. ''See that? Two people moving south 400 meters away from us,'' Caroon said, pointing down the mountain face. More insurgents were located nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sir, what do you want to do?'' Caroon asked Kearney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I want them dead,'' Kearney said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Engage them?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes. Take 'em out.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Caroon radioed the pilot his instructions, ''On-scene commander's intent is to engage.'' And that was it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A sudden wail pierced the night sky. It was Slasher, an AC-130 gunship, firing bullets the size of Coke bottles. Flaming shapes ricocheted all around the village. Kearney was in overdrive. The soldiers back at the KOP were radioing in that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was tracking 10 men near the tree line. Yarnell was picking up insurgent radio traffic. ''They're talking about getting ready to hit us,'' someone said. The pilot could see five men, one entering a house, then, no, some were in the trees, some inside, and then, multiple houses. He wanted confirmation -- were all these targets hostile? Did Kearney have any collateral-damage concerns? Cursing, Kearney told them to engage the men outside but not to hit the house. The pilots radioed back that men had just run inside. No doubt there would be a family. Caroon reminded Kearney that Slasher had only enough fuel to stay in position for 10 more minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What do you want to do, sir?'' Caroon asked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney radioed his soldiers back at the KOP to contact his boss, Lt. Col. Bill Ostlund. Ostlund, a Nebraska social scientist who could switch effortlessly from aggressive bomber to political negotiator talking family values with Afghan tribal elders, was in the crowded tactical-operations room at Camp Blessing watching the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> video feed and getting the same intelligence. He signed off on collateral damage, and Kearney turned to Caroon: ''Take out the compound. And anyone that comes out.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Flaming rockets flashed through the sky. Thunder rumbled and echoed through the valley. Then there was a pause. Slasher asked Caroon whether the insurgents were still talking. Kearney shouted over to Yarnell in his ditch, ''You picking anything up?'' Nothing. More spitting rockets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The night seemed incomprehensible and interminable. Slasher departed and Gunmetal -- an Apache helicopter -- swept in. Radio communication kept breaking down. At one point the crew of Gunmetal, sensing no hostile intent, refused Kearney's orders to fire. Then suddenly Gunmetal was rocketing at figures scattering for cover. Then Slasher was back in the sky doing more ''work.'' In the predawn light Bone -- the nickname for the B-1 bomber that seemed to be the soldiers' favorite -- winged in and dropped two 2,000-pound bombs above the village. Finally, around dawn, a weary Kearney, succumbing to gallows humor, adrenaline and exhaustion, said: ''O.K., I've done my killing for the week. I'm ready to go home.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney estimated that they killed about 20 people, adding: ''I'm not gonna lie. Some are probably civilians.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the logic of war, the best antidote for the menacing ghostliness of the ambushing enemy is killing and knowing you've killed them. The soldiers in the Korengal almost never had that kind of satisfaction. Any insurgents, if they were killed, would be buried fast, and all that was left in their wake were wounded civilians. That morning, after a long night of fighting, was no different. Within an hour or so, Lt. Matt Piosa, an earnest, 24-year-old West Point grad, and his patrol were in Yaka China. They radioed that the village elders were asking to bury their dead. They'd also collected wounded civilians. The tally was bad -- 5 killed and 11 wounded, all of them women, girls and boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney radioed Camp Blessing the bad news and dropped his head between his knees. Killing women and children was tragedy enough. But civilian casualties are also a political issue. If he didn't manage to explain his actions to the Yaka China villagers and get them to understand his intentions, he could lose them to the enemy. Meanwhile, Yarnell and his team were intercepting radio messages like: ''Be very quiet. Move the things over here. Pray for us.'' At least some of the insurgents from the previous night's fight had survived to fight again. The planes were tracking them hiding along a creek. But after the civilian casualties of the night before, senior commanders were refusing to give Kearney clearance to bomb or rocket them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The short day was fading. The sun dropped behind the peaks. The cold winds rattled our bones. The soldiers tried to make light of their conviction that they'd be attacked by those insurgents dissolving into the villages. Their fears were realized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hearts and Minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TO TRY TO ACQUIRE allies, Kearney and some of his men flew down the next day    to Yaka China. With nowhere else to land, the Black Hawk helicopters descended    on the roof of a house not far below the compound that Slasher, the AC-130,    had rocketed the night of the 19th. Dust and dried grass whipped across the    house and the villagers' faces. Just to endear themselves even more, the    soldiers from Battle Company had to step on harvested corn as they climbed down;    it was drying on the second story. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The adversaries faced off in the courtyard as chickens sprinted in and out. On one side were Kearney, Ostlund and Larry LeGree, a naval nuclear engineer and head of the Provincial Reconstruction Team, together with their entourage, including interpreters, all in futuristic high-tech gear. On the other side were the Korengali elders, who looked as if they stepped out of ''Lord of the Rings'' with their crooked walking sticks, beards dyed red and blue eyes framed by kohl. With no Afghan government out here, the elders are the only channel for communication. The younger men sat on the ground, wrapped in shawls and bold indifference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney squatted and told the Korengalis that when he came to this region he hoped to walk into Yaka China and find out what the villagers needed. Instead, he found that there were some 50 insurgents in and around the village. He pointed to the evidence -- military radio batteries that his men had found, binoculars, rockets, an old pistol, a small pamphlet titled, in Arabic, ''How to Kill,'' and one in Pashto, ''The Concise Book on the Virtues of Jihad'' -- that had been collected in the general area by Afghan soldiers and Americans. It was not a very incriminating haul, and everyone knew it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The day before, a U.S. medevac had airlifted out the wounded civilians from the village. Humanitarian assistance was air-dropped in, including concrete for retaining walls, rice and blankets for winter. The provisions were not compensation, Kearney told the elders. ''It's what the government does for their people when there is security here,'' he said. He asked them to tell him where in the mountains the insurgents were hiding their supplies. ''That way I don't have to come in here and shoot at you and identify the good guys from the bad guys,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To keep his bearings amid the hostile faces, Kearney kept appealing to Haji Zalwar Khan, the leading go-between among the valley's elders. He made his fortune in the timber trade and blamed the Americans for shutting it down. He tried to placate both the Americans and the insurgents. He was not about to side with Kearney in public. ''How can I know where you found these things?'' he asked, referring to the jihadi items. ''In the mountain? The house? How do I know whom they belong to?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney smiled. He was getting used to the routine between the Americans and the villagers -- miscommunication and deception. The encounter felt as much performative, a necessary part of the play, as substantive. And I wondered how Kearney was going to keep his sanity for 10 more months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just a week or so earlier, I had been at the KOP when villagers from Aliabad -- a mile south of the KOP, and the home village of Haji Zalwar Khan -- complained to Kearney that some ordinance had hit a house. Later they sent up the homeowner's teenage son to wrest compensation from Kearney. As we walked to the KOP's entrance to meet the boy, a shot rang out, then another. The bullets smacked the dirt in front of us. Kearney shoved me into a shack where an Afghan was cooking bread. A few more shots were fired. It was ''One-Shot Freddy,'' as the soldiers refer to him, an insurgent shooter everyone had a theory about regarding the vintage of his gun, his identity, his tactics -- but neither Kearney's scouts nor Shadow the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could ever track him. I accidentally slashed my forearm on a nail in the shack and as I watched the blood pool I thought that if I had to live with Freddy and his ilk for months on end I, too, would see a forked tongue in every villager and start dreaming of revenge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney was angry. ''Taliban shot your house?'' he asked the boy from Aliabad. An interpreter translated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No, said the boy, Americans did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What'd we shoot with?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't know the weapon, but there's little holes and two big holes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I didn't shoot into Aliabad,'' said Kearney, adding that if one of his soldiers had, it was because insurgents were firing from the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No one shoots from the village,'' said the boy, though everyone knew insurgents had wounded several of Kearney's soldiers by shooting from the mosque, the cemetery, the school. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The boy changed course, ''God knows better than me,'' and that sent Kearney on a riff: ''Yes. God does and God talks to me and told me they do.'' And by the way, hadn't the boy noticed that the bad guys always start shooting first? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''O.K., then shoot them, not our house,'' the boy said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Then tell me where the bad guys are,'' Kearney said. The boy said he didn't know. What he knew was that the Americans were always shooting at the village. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This went on for some time. When the boy again protested that no one shoots from his village, Kearney interrupted him. ''Aminullah does,'' he said. Aminullah was a native of Aliabad and a rising figure in the valley's insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The boy smiled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You're smiling because you know I'm right,'' Kearney said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You're right,'' the boy said. ''So shoot the cemetery, not our house.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney moved closer to him. ''Look, if you want help with your house, all you have to do is ask. But don't accuse us every time something goes wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The boy laughed and repeated that he didn't know where the bad guys were. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's crazy, man. They must be ghosts!'' Kearney said, laughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Aminullah doesn't come to Aliabad anymore,'' the boy said, perhaps trying to give Kearney a bone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney leapt at it. ''So Aminullah is bad?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ah! Finally! We're getting somewhere.'' Kearney took off his helmet and squeezed his hands together and rocked as he sat on a wall. ''What about Mohammad Tali, he's a good guy isn't he?'' Kearney asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Smiling again, the boy looked at the dirt: ''No. You already told us he's a bad guy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ah!'' Kearney said, throwing up his hands. ''So you were down there in the village when I gave radios and food. But instead you say I shoot at you all the time?'' Kearney swung his legs back and forth. ''Hey dude, ask yourself. Why would I bring you radios and food and shoot at you? Does Aminullah? No. What happened that day after I left?'' The boy said all he knew was that the villagers went home and ''they'' started shooting. ''Where?'' Kearney asked, ''from your village?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What can I say? The Americans were in my village.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yeah, so I was doing good stuff for you guys and they shot at me. And what I'm trying to say is they could have shot at you again. And if I shoot at your house I'll help. We'll fix up that wall. I'm not here to hurt you.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everyone was getting restless in the little check post. Kearney tried to lighten up a bit. He asked the boy what he thought about the Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You build roads and clinics and schools and are here to help,'' the boy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Cop out,'' Kearney shouted, chuckling. ''Easy answer. Hey dude, you can say we're rotten and messing up your lumber trade.'' The boy laughed. Kearney laughed. Pfc. Michael Cunningham, the radio operator, and Sgt. Taylor White, who always manned the check post, both laughed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''See, I knew it,'' Kearney said. ''That's what you really think. Think I want to be here?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yeah,'' the boy said. ''I think so.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Dude. I got a wife and son. I came here to help you out. If you give me as much help as possible I'll get out of here a hell of a lot faster.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney told him to enjoy Ramadan, and then shouted, ''Where's my fuzzy friend?'' as he looked about for Jericho, the puppy whose ears were chopped off by an Afghan worker: it was pre-emptive preparation for dog fighting -- the ears would just give an enemy dog something to grab onto. ''I need someone to make me happy. Jericho, I need some love.'' Jericho appeared, leaping about. Kearney picked him up. ''Hey, what's up buddy? You're a good boy. You smell like dirt.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney turned to Cunningham and White and said, ''Well, he's the first to admit Aminullah's bad.'' And give or take a little unreliable information shared here and there, that was the Korengal routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fight Time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE DAY AFTER the meeting with the elders of Yaka China, Yarnell and John could    hear insurgents trying to pinpoint where Kearney and his men were. The helicopters    had moved us to a ridge line, about 8,400 feet high, straddling the Korengal    and Shuriak Valleys. The insurgents used the deep caves, boulders and forests    as hideouts and transit routes between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. We could hear    someone who called himself Obeid saying he'd do whatever the Yaka China    elders decided -- whether to cooperate with the Americans or take revenge.    By evening the elders had apparently reached their verdict. It was fight time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney, too, had reached a verdict. He would fool the insurgents, feigning a troop extraction when the helicopters came for resupply and pushing out his best guys in small ''kill teams.'' We heard the insurgents say, ''We have wolves on them,'' meaning spotters. A hoarse, whispering insurgent had eyes on either Sgt. Larry Rougle and his scouts or on Lieutenant Piosa and his rear guard. There was joking that Rougle and Piosa should dance and see which one the whisperer was spying on. Then nothing happened for almost 24 hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rougle -- who was called Wildcat -- was on his sixth deployment since Sept. 11, 2001. He was with the first group of Rangers in Afghanistan. Even his rough background was something of a legend; he would tell how he grew up in a South Jersey gang, shot a guy, went to ''juvie,'' and there taught himself Russian (though he was estranged from his Russian father), taught himself politics, history, zoology. At night out in the woods, he'd tell his fellow scouts, ''You know penguins are monogamous?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I hung out with Piosa and his crew. His white skin, red hair and blue eyes belied the months of constant warfare he and his platoon had scraped through. It was a beautiful autumn afternoon and the soldiers were joking around, heating up Meals Ready to Eat, spitting gobs of Copenhagen and then, in a moment, recess was over. The insurgents were on them. Bullets ricocheted all through the woods. A strange silence fell as everyone scrambled for cover. Three of us crouched behind a skinny pine tree. And the silence broke: curses, shouting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Where's it coming from?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Where are my guys?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Jones, are you seeing things?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More bullets. Cracks against the tree trunks. Bits of confusing information were coming in on Piosa's radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're comin' up the low ground at 2-4'' -- Sergeant Rice's call sign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One W.I.A. hit in the arm.'' Then there was panic and screaming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The enemy's overtaken the hill,'' bellowed Pvt. Sterling Dunn from further down the trees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''2-4 is hit'' -- that was Rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Wildcat is run over the hill'' -- that was Rougle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Get a team to run up there and take that hill. They pushed Wildcat over the hill!'' Piosa shouted, trying over and over to reach Rice and Rougle, but getting no answer. The battalion surgeon, Capt. Joel Dean, and a sergeant sprinted up the hill to get to the wounded. As the first Americans neared Rice and Rougle's positions they were fired on from those same positions. What was going on? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I followed Piosa through the brush toward the ridge. We came upon Rice and Specialist Carl Vandenberge behind some trees. Vandenberge was drenched in blood. The shot to his arm had hit an artery. Rice was shot in the stomach. A soldier was using the heating chemicals from a Meal Ready to Eat to warm Vandenberge and keep him from going into shock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Piosa moved on to the hill where the men had been overrun. I saw big blue-eyed John Clinard, a sergeant from North Carolina, falling to pieces. He worshiped Rougle. ''Sergeant Rougle is dying. It's my fault. . . . I'm sorry. . . . I tried to get up the hill. . . .'' Sergeant Rougle was lying behind him. Someone had already covered him with a blanket. Only the soles of his boots were visible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's nothing you could do,'' Piosa said, grabbing Clinard's shoulder. ''You got to be the man now. You can do it. I need you to get down to Rice and Vandenberge and get them to the medevac.'' Clinard wiped his face, seemed to snap to and headed off through the trees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two of Rice's squad mates appeared, eyes dilated. They couldn't believe they'd seen, up close, the ghosts they'd been fighting for the last five months. ''I saw him in the eyes,'' Specialist Marc Solowski said. ''He looked at me. I shot him.'' He and Specialist Michael Jackson had crawled up the hill twice trying to retake it. Each time the insurgents in ''manjammies'' whipped them back with machine-gun fire. There was blood on the stones around us. Some thought they saw blood trailing down toward the village of Landigal, where they were sure an insurgent had dashed into a cottage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're not losing this hill again,'' Piosa shouted. ''This hill is ours!'' He wanted bombs to be dropped immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's women praying in that house,'' Dunn shouted back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was fixating on Rougle's black hat, lying by the bloodied rock patch where Dunn was sitting, when Sergeant Stichter, Dunn's senior, appeared, out of breath and shaking, back from tending to Vandenberge. He needed water. The F-15 known as Dude was en route, the Apaches were chasing men and Kearney -- who had bolted down the mountain, throwing grenades in caves -- was barking orders. Kearney was badly shaken. He adored Rougle, and he'd broken down when he saw his big old buddy Rice bleeding at the landing zone. Rice comforted him and then lumbered to the helicopter, just asking to talk to his wife before they put him under. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The insurgents had run off with some of Rougle, Rice and Vandenberge's stuff -- ammunition, communication equipment, night vision goggles, machine guns. Kearney wanted the equipment back. He wanted to punish the valley. Stichter had his eyes on a guy pacing a rooftop in Landigal and wanted to blow his head off. Specialist Mitchell Raeon, whose uniform was now soaked in Rougle's blood, had the guy in his scope but couldn't range that far. ''That's a female,'' Dunn said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney had identified insurgents who'd dashed into a house and wanted to hit them, but Stichter got back word from Camp Blessing saying the target was too close to other houses. Kearney sent back a reminder -- you let some guys get away the other night. It was impossible to know for sure, but Kearney believed they were the guys who had killed Rougle, and now, he said, you're going to let another group get away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Someone cursed, then said, ''They're all leaving the house.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney radioed down to one of his lieutenants at an observation post. ''Where are they going?'' Yarnell heard the insurgents say they were coming back for the rest of the equipment. And then, with no warning, an F-15 dropped a bomb on Landigal, but off target, or so it seemed. Kearney was furious. He was sure headquarters had intentionally missed the house he had wanted hit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I noticed Raeon was packing and unpacking Rougle's things. Rougle's scouts were in disarray, rudderless, and admitting it. Raeon said he kept seeing in his mind Rougle's face alert and then dead, switching back and forth; he wanted it to stop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next day brought another brief firefight, and Rougle's scouts rallied swiftly. They said they felt him watching and proud. There were more bomb drops and refusals to drop bombs, and then Becky, everyone's favorite Apache pilot, swept in. Not only did she offer the comforting voice of a woman seeping right into their ears, but Becky was one of the most aggressive shooters. She flew up and down the canyon walls seeking out and rocketing insurgents. We heard them on the radio again boasting about retreating to safety under fire. They talked about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Landigal that they thought might have killed Azizullah -- ''a real bad guy,'' the radio operator told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kearney was watching a crow flying above us. ''Taliban are right,'' he said. ''Like they said yesterday, follow the birds, they follow the Americans. I wish I was made as strong as haj'' -- their nickname for insurgents. ''They were balls to do what they did. And guess what? I'm not gonna lie. They won.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Killing Together</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS WE WAITED for dusk to get back to the KOP, we all knew the insurgents were    nearby, eyes on Kearney, eyes on the soldiers down in the valley. Even nightfall    was no comfort because the full moon was floodlighting the Korengal. I returned    to the KOP by helicopter with Kearney, while 1st and 2nd Platoons had to make    the long trek back on foot. As soon as 1st Platoon set off, the insurgents struck    with a devastating L-shaped ambush. All Kearney could do, back at the KOP, was    calm his boys on the radio, get in the medevac and invoke the gods of war. The    Apaches, Slasher and Bone dropped bombs all night. The soldiers and insurgents    were so close that when Slasher, the AC-130, flew in, the pilot coordinated    not with the JTAC but with Sgt. Roberto Sandifer, the platoon's forward    observer, who at that moment was under fire watching one of his guys die. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Around midnight, 1st Platoon filed into the KOP, eyes bulging, drenched in sweat, river water and blood. They were hauling the belongings of Mohammad Tali, a high-value target. Specialist Sal Giunta had killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next day I climbed up to the KOP and found Specialist Giunta, a quiet Iowan lofted into a heroism he didn't want. His officers were putting him up for a medal of honor. Giunta told me the story of that night, how they'd barely moved 300 yards before they were blasted. Giunta was fourth in the file when it happened, and he jumped into a ditch. He couldn't figure out why they were getting hit from where Joshua Brennan and baby-faced Franklin Eckrode should have been leading up ahead. He knew it must be bad, but as he leapt up to check he got whacked with a bullet in his armored chest plate. It threw him down. They were taking fire from three sides. He grabbed some grenades: ''I couldn't throw as far as Sergeant Gallardo. We were looking like retards and I decided to run out in front of the grenades.'' He found Eckrode with gunshot wounds. ''He was down but moving and trying to fix his SAW'' -- a heavy machine gun -- ''so I just kept on running up the trail. It was cloudy. I was running and saw dudes. Plural.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He couldn't figure out who they were. Then he realized they were hauling Brennan off through the forest. ''I started shooting,'' he recalled. ''I emptied that magazine. They dropped Brennan.'' Giunta scrambled up to Brennan. He was a mess. His lower jaw was shot off. ''He was still conscious. He was breathing. He was asking for morphine. I said, 'You'll get out and tell your hero stories,' and he was like, 'I will, I will.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were still taking fire. No one was there to help. Hugo Mendoza, their platoon medic, was back in another ditch, calling: ''I'm bleeding out. I'm dying.'' Giunta saw Brennan's eyes go back. His breathing was bad. Giunta got Brennan to squeeze his hand. A medic showed up out of the sky. They prepared Brennan to be hoisted to the medevac in a basket. Soon he would be dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the medevacs flew out, Sergeant Sandifer had talked in air cover: Slasher, the AC-130. The pilot was a woman and, Sandifer later told me, ''It was so reassuring for us to hear her voice.'' She spotted guys hiding and asked if she was clear to engage. '' 'You're cleared hot,' I told her. And we killed two people together.'' But, at this point, the killings were no consolation to Sandifer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Giunta said, ''The richest, most-trained army got beat by dudes in manjammies and A.K.'s.'' His voice cracked. He was not just hurting, he was in a rage. And there was nothing for him to do with it but hold back his tears, and bark -- at the Afghans for betraying them, at the Army for betraying them. He didn't run to the front because he was a hero. He ran up to get to Brennan, his friend. ''But they'' -- he meant the military -- ''just keep asking for more from us.'' His contract would be up in 18 days but he had been stop-lossed and couldn't go home. Brennan himself was supposed to have gotten out in September. He'd been planning to go back to Wisconsin where his dad lived, play his guitar and become a cop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sandifer was questioning why they were sticking it out in the Korengal when the people so clearly hated them. He was haunted by Mendoza's voice calling to him: ''I'm bleeding out. I'm dying.'' He worried that the Korengal was going to push them off the deep end. In his imagination it had already happened. One day an Afghan visited their fire base, Sandifer told me. ''I was staring at him, on the verge of picking up my weapon to shoot him,'' he said. ''I know right from wrong, but even if I did shoot him everyone at the fire base would have been O.K. We're all to the point of 'Lord of the Flies.' '' And they still had 10 months to go in the Korengal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I wondered how Kearney was going to win back his own guys, let alone win over the Korengalis. Just before I left, Kearney told me his biggest struggle would be holding his guys in check. ''I've got too many geeking out, wanting to go off the deep end and kill people,'' he said. One of his lieutenants wanted to shoot every Afghan in the face. Kearney shook his head. He wished he could buy 20 goats and let the boys beat and burn them and let loose their rage. He tried to tell them the restraints were a product of their success -- that there was an Afghan government with its own rules. ''I'm balancing plates on my goddamn nose is what I'm doing,'' he said. ''All it's gonna take is for one of these guys to snap.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But leave the Korengal, as the colonel had suggested, and let some other company deal with it? No way. He'd spent five months learning the valley, getting involved in it; he couldn't just pull out. At least he would keep the insurgents busy here so the other companies could do hearts and minds unimpeded down along the Pech river. ''I lost seven dudes here,''he told me. ''It's too much blood. I don't want to give this up. This is mine.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Be Continued</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  COLONEL OSTLUND and his officers, and the governor of Kunar and his officials,    held an all-day meeting with the Korengali elders. The elders wanted to talk    about Rock Avalanche and the devastation that had rained down on them. Colonel    Ostlund told them, ''If anything should happen to Captain Kearney, pain    and misery will knock on many doors in the Korengal.'' He gave them 10    days to pick sides -- the insurgents or the government. Only then would    he consider going ahead with the road project. Their answer came back. They    would leave the valley altogether. But they didn't, and 10 days later    insurgents pulled off another ambush of a platoon from the 173rd. The entire    patrol went down, either wounded or killed. Kearney told me recently that they    had wounded Abu Ikhlas and killed some other bad guys. He said he was pretty    sure that Haji Matin, the embittered timber lord, had been killed, too. But    the dialogue with the Korengalis was pretty much the same as it had been. Only    the winter snows have brought some minor respite to the valley. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaders in the Andes tiptoed from the edge of war to bear hugs and oaths of brotherhood, Latin America was trying to sort out the winners and losers in the region's worst diplomatic dispute in years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A day after the crisis was resolved at a summit meeting in the Dominican Republic on Friday, it was already clear that nearly all of the players lost something. The leaders of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela traded charges that muddied each of them. Colombia and its ally, the United States, found themselves isolated in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Latin America's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,  lost two senior commanders in a week, the latest in a string of tactical and strategic defeats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the biggest winner appears to have been the region itself, which resolved its own dispute without outside help and without violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crisis began when Colombian security forces hunted down and killed Raul Reyes, the FARC's second-in-command, and 23 others in a raid last weekend on the guerrillas' camp in Ecuador. Venezuela and Ecuador assailed Colombia as having violated Ecuador's sovereignty, cut diplomatic ties and sent troops to the Colombian border in a show of force, effectively defending the FARC's nebulous operations in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colombia insists it has the right to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> its enemies, but the military response by its neighbors -- President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela vowed war if Colombia pursued its fight with the FARC into Venezuela -- could allow the FARC to operate with more freedom outside Colombia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, that victory may be small consolation for the FARC, whose very presence in neighboring countries is a reflection of its loss of strength within Colombia, as a brutally successful counterinsurgency has driven it out of territory it once controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reports emerged on Friday of yet another senior commander of the FARC who had been killed. No cross-border raid was involved. A deserter simply brought the guerrilla's severed right hand as proof that he had killed his own commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The killing of the guerrilla, Manuel Jesus Munoz, who went by the nom de guerre Ivan Rios, was extraordinarily macabre even in the annals of Colombia's four-decade war. Mr. Munoz, a member of the FARC's guiding secretariat, was the fifth senior member of group killed in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colombia's government contends that the FARC, which finances itself through cocaine trafficking and abductions for ransom, has seen its ranks fall from 16,000 members at the start of the decade, when the guerrillas had advanced close to the capital, Bogota, to between 6,000 and 8,000 now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Colombia, too, the results were mixed. It found itself diplomatically isolated in the region, its tactics rebuked and President Alvaro Uribe under siege as a too-willing ally of the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The raid was one of the most controversial chapters of Plan Colombia, the American program that has disbursed more than $5 billion in aid to Colombia since the late 1990s. And in carrying out the operation without getting Ecuador's permission beforehand, Mr. Uribe took a page from the Bush administration's playbook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The  predawn operation  bears remarkable similarities to one carried out in late January by the United States in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that case, the Central Intelligence Agency used a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft to drop missiles, killing Abu Laith al-Libi, a senior commander of Al Qaeda who had hidden from American officials for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both operations used local informants to track the men down. Both operations were carried out in foreign countries without getting permission beforehand. Both were tactical victories, killing enemies classified as terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in killing Mr. Reyes in Ecuador, Mr. Uribe may have misjudged the reaction that would follow. A firestorm of criticism was directed at Colombia, a nation increasingly viewed as a redoubt of loyalty to the United States in a region chafing at Washington's waning influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Bush doctrine openly rejects nonintervention in other nations' affairs, something that runs counter to the ideal of sovereignty that is so precious in Latin America,'' said Greg Grandin, a professor of Latin American history at New York University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The methods employed by Mr. Uribe, whose father was believed to have been killed by guerrillas in the early 1980s, may be hard to swallow in a region that has largely seen its other cold war-era insurgencies vanquished. On Thursday, Nicaragua joined the fray on the side of Venezuela and Ecuador. But the wrath of Colombia's neighbors is a price Mr. Uribe seems content to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite Colombia's insistence that it acted alone, speculation persists as to whether the technological prowess of the United States was involved in the hunt for Mr. Reyes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Chavez emphatically denied reports last week that he had placed a call to Mr. Reyes's satellite phone; such a call might have allowed intelligence agencies to track the guerrilla down in Sucumbios, an Amazonian province in Ecuador's northern frontier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In their war of words, Mr. Uribe accused his counterparts in Ecuador and Venezuela of having financial ties to the FARC, a group resembling a criminal syndicate that dresses up its actions in leftist rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the presidents of Ecuador and Venezuela reminded Latin America of the ties between many of Mr. Uribe's top supporters in Colombia and the paramilitary death squads that have evolved into nothing less than criminal syndicates trafficking in cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cocaine, guns, private armies and guerrillas remain the ingredients of Colombia's war even as the last element is being visibly pushed into the porous border regions of the country's neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, Latin America eased its own crisis. But the celebratory behavior of its leaders in the Dominican Republic belies the tension that persists around a war without closure. Just because the FARC is weakened does not mean it will wither away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with a sharp escalation of suicide bombings in urban areas, the leaders of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new coalition government say they will negotiate with the militants believed to be orchestrating the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and will use military force only as a last resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That talk has alarmed American officials, who fear it reflects a softening stance toward the militants just as President Pervez Musharraf has given the Bush administration a freer hand to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at militants using pilotless Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Pakistanis, however, are convinced that the surge in suicide bombings -- 17 in the first 10 weeks of 2008 -- is retaliation for three Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the beginning of the year. The spike in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> combined with the crushing defeat of Mr. Musharraf's party in February parliamentary elections, has brought demands for change in his American-backed policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking in separate interviews, the leaders of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new government coalition -- Asif Ali Zardari of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party and Nawaz Sharif, head of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N -- tried to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a more independent stance from Washington and repackage the conflict in a more palatable way for Pakistanis. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said they were determined to set a different course from that of President Musharraf, who has received generous military financial help of more than $10 billion from Washington for his support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are dealing with our own people,'' said Mr. Sharif, who was twice prime minister in the 1990s. ''We will deal with them very sensibly. And when you have a problem in your own family, you don't kill your own family. You sit and talk. After all, Britain also got the solution of the problem of Ireland. So what's the harm in conducting negotiations?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari said: ''Obviously what they have been doing for the last eight years has not been working. Even a fool knows that.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The war against the insurgents has to be redefined, he said, as ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war'' for a public that has come to resent the conflict as being pushed on the country as part of an American agenda. It should be dealt with by talks and the use of a beefed-up police force rather than the army, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington opposed past negotiations because in its view short-term peace deals between the militants and the Pakistani military were a sign of weakness and resulted in the militants' winning time to fortify themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said on a visit to Islamabad last month that talks with the militants were not helpful in the ''short term.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In general terms, according to a retired senior Pakistani general who remains close to the current military leadership, new negotiations would be likely to involve a ban on non-Pakistani militants -- like Afghans, Uzbeks and Chechens -- coming from southern Afghanistan into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in return for reduced operations by the Pakistani Army in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But precisely how those talks would be different from the negotiations that led to failed peace deals under Mr. Musharraf is not entirely clear, except that negotiators would represent the newly elected government rather than the military government of the past eight years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Neither Mr. Zardari nor Mr. Sharif was specific about whom among the militant groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas they favored talking to. Nor was it clear what kind of formula or quid pro quo the two political leaders had in mind for the talks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharif, whose Islamic religious background is conservative, refused to say whether he would negotiate with Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader whom the government blames for many if not most of the recent suicide bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani terrorism experts have said they believe that Mr. Mehsud was behind the assassination of the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in December, and that he works in tandem with Al Qaeda. ''Nobody gave me any presentation on this subject,'' Mr. Sharif said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whom the negotiations would be held with, Mr. Sharif replied: ''With all the concerned elements. I don't think guns and bullets have so far produced any positive results.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any result that smacks of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ceding further control over the tribal areas is not one likely to be welcomed in Washington. The Bush administration views the tribal areas as a sanctuary for Taliban forces who cross the border into Afghanistan to fight American and NATO forces, as well as a base for Al Qaeda to plot new terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistanis, however, have come to see the tribal areas as something entirely different: a once peaceful region where a group of militants have turned their wrath on the rest of the country as punishment for the American alliance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many civilians were among the 274 people killed since the beginning of the year, but the dead also included young soldiers and policemen, according to a tally by the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. A bomb explosion last Saturday at an Italian restaurant favored by foreigners in Islamabad wounded four F.B.I. agents and underscored for Pakistanis yet again the American involvement here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington may have little choice but to adjust to the new policies, said a retired Pakistani Army brigadier, Mehmood Shah, who was in charge of security in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Of the new Pakistani government, Mr. Shah said: ''They will not like to be seen as dictated to by the United States. They would like it to be seen as 'our war.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Shah, who met with Admiral Mullen in Islamabad, said there was a popular sense in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- prevalent on television talk shows as well as in the halls of Parliament -- that it was time to ''keep a distance from the United States.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new leaders fashion their strategy, however, they will unavoidably be dealing with programs devised by Washington to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regain control of the lawless tribal areas. In some places, the approaches may yet dovetail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For instance, one element of the stepped-up American aid effort is a $400 million plan to train the Frontier Corps, an underfinanced paramilitary force that is used to patrol the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharif said he had heard about the plan, expected to begin in October, but had no details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari favored employing such a force over relying on the army, which he said was the ''wrong instrument'' to use against the militants. ''We need to use the police force,'' he said. ''They had few guns, made in 1952. You have to upgrade them. You have got to give them modern technology, and they will stand better than anybody else.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharif, who is regarded as a nationalist -- he gave the go-ahead for the explosion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear bomb in 1998 -- said he was not in favor of foreign aid. ''I think frankly we should rely less on aid,'' he said. ''It makes us, you see, lazy. We should generate our own resources.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both men stressed that the new Parliament, which held its first session this week, would be consulted on the strategy toward the insurgency, a sharp distinction from the go-it-alone behavior of Mr. Musharraf, who until last year served as both head of the army and president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharif and Mr. Zardari have made much of the fact that they received a broad mandate in the elections last month. To that end, they said, they would revive the role of Parliament. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As an example of the docile legislature, a recent report of Parliament's committee on defense for the last four years consisted of 67 pages. The panel was apparently so short of funds, the report was published with financing from the United States Agency for International Development, whose logo appears on the last page. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The only mention in the report of the fight against terrorism was about a resolution by the committee in 2007 criticizing the United States for threatening to link the amount of aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the performance of the army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another important distinction from the past is that the new government would not use ''the same tainted network of agencies and the army who have created this'' situation, said one of Mr. Sharif's senior aides, Nisar Ali Khan, who has relatives in prominent positions in the army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The new start won't be with them,'' he said. ''It has to be a multifaceted operation with the tribal chiefs who are operating in the area.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both parties have long accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence agencies of backing militant groups, even as the government has been forced to negotiate with them. Many of the groups were used to pressure India and Afghanistan, but have more recently turned their fury back on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as they have become more radicalized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those intelligence agencies will almost certainly have new leadership chosen by a new prime minister. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ijaz Shah, the head of the powerful Intelligence Bureau and a confidant of Mr. Musharraf, resigned this week. His replacement will be named by the new prime minister, who is expected to be announced on Monday  by Mr. Zardari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari is not immediately eligible to become prime minister because he did not run for Parliament. But he is likely to do so in the coming months and then assume the mantle of prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Are Open to Peace Deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jimmy Carter said that in talks in Damascus, Syria, he had extracted a promise from the militant group Hamas to respect the creation of a Palestinian state negotiated by Hamas's rivals in the Palestinian Authority if it were ratified by a referendum of the Palestinian people. Mr. Carter also said he found Syrian leaders eager for a full peace treaty with Israel.  PAGE A10 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GEORGIA-RUSSIA TENSION ESCALATES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Georgia accused Russia of violating its airspace and using a MiG fighter jet to shoot down an unmanned Georgian reconnaissance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the separatist territory of Abkhazia. Russia's Air Force denied the Georgian claim, but Georgia released what it said was the video recording of the final live feed received from the unarmed reconnaissance aircraft.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PAKISTANIS FREE ISLAMIST LEADER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The provincial government in Peshawar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released from prison the leader of a banned Islamist movement after he agreed to denounce violence and work to bring peace to the area. The prisoner was detained six years ago after leading hundreds of men in Afghanistan to fight against United States forces. The agreement appears to be an attempt to pacify the region through negotiation.  PAGE A14 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RICE PRESSES IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for greater financial and diplomatic support for Iraq during a meeting with Arab foreign ministers in Bahrain, but she did not win any new commitments. The ministers did agree that Iraq could be included in future such gatherings, a gesture Ms. Rice called ''a very good step forward for the reintegration of Iraq into regional affairs.''

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AFGHAN BAN ON SOAP OPERAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the latest battle of the war between Afghanistan's cultural conservatives and liberals, the minister for information and culture ordered television networks to stop broadcasting five soap operas, saying they were not in keeping with ''Afghan religion and culture.'' The companies initially refused to obey the order but one network has since pulled one show.  PAGE A6 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY,  AGE IS MORE THAN A NUMBER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Young people have left Pennsylvania in droves, giving the state the second-highest proportion of people over 65 in the country (Florida is first). That could be a big factor in the Democratic primary, as age has been a stubborn dividing line in the Democratic race -- with older voters opting for Hillary Rodham Clinton and younger voters flocking to Barack Obama. ''This is classic generational politics,'' one demographer said. ''Their identification with one candidate or the other has to do with the time when voters were socialized.'' PAGE A22 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE CONS OF THE DREAM TICKET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has been bandied about as a Democratic ''super-ticket'': both Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton as the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees (or vice versa). But one of the big hitches in this scenario coming to fruition is the personal animus the two candidates feel for one another. And were Mr. Obama to secure the presidential nomination, he would have to consider the challenges of managing a certain former president, in this case, his vice president's spouse.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SORTING THROUGH SECT'S GENES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lab workers began taking DNA samples from the 416 children seized in a raid of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religious polygamist sect in Texas. They are trying to determine family blood lines for the children -- to determine whether the group routinely married under-age teenage girls of 15 or younger -- which is made difficult because many children share the same name and have been raised in a communal setting by numerous mothers married to the same man.  PAGE A19 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EFFORTS ON VETERANS AND SUICIDES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On an average day, there are 18 suicides among America's 25 million military veterans, says a spokeswoman from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The agency set up a hot line for veterans in crisis, which has fielded more than 37,200 calls since it opened in August. The hot line gives local responders information so they can check in on troubled veterans, who are at greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, which heightens their risks for suicide.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PATERSON SUGGESTS HE GAVE MORE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Than Tax Returns Indicate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his first remarks after reports surfaced that he and his wife had given just $150 to charity last year, Gov. David Paterson said he did not want to reveal more about his charitable giving because he worried it would bring intrusive news media attention to those he helps. ''I felt to go further into an explanation opened the door to a feeding frenzy that I thought I was the victim of in the last month,'' he said.  PAGE C12 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WINDFALL FOR ROOSEVELT SCHOOLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert-Wayne Harris, the superintendent of the long-suffering school district of Roosevelt, has been bombarded with calls from textbook peddlers and education consultants since receiving $10.8 million in extra state money. Roosevelt, which was $8 million in debt last fall, is like a grand-prize winner in a state budget cycle in which virtually all of New York's districts ended up with at least a consolation prize.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Little Hope for Relief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gasoline prices surpassed $3.50 a gallon nationwide for the first time and oil jumped to a record as the long rise of energy prices showed little evidence of giving way to recession fears. Some analysts expect it to approach $4 a gallon this summer. The latest rise was prompted by reports that a Nigerian rebel group had blown up pipelines in the Niger Delta.  PAGE C1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  INDIA'S TEA MARKETS GO DIGITAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tea has been traded at the Tea Auction Center in the state of Assam, heart of India's famed tea country, since 1861. But this year, the cacophony of the public tea auctions will give way to the gentle tapping of keyboards: India's tea markets are going digital. The move to computerized auctions promises to turn the tradition-bound world of tea traders upside down.  PAGE C1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WALL STREET HOT SHOTS BACK OBAMA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you made more than $520 million last year in take-home pay, which presidential candidate would you support? The answer, apparently, is Senator Barack Obama, who is backing the ''Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act,'' which would limit all the offshore accounts the wealthiest hedge funds have set up. Many of the nation's wealthiest hedge managers have contributed to Mr. Obama's campaign.  PAGE C1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SWISS BANK CITES BLIND AMBITION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Swiss banking giant UBS, which has written off more debt from the subprime crisis than any other bank, conceded in a report that a blind drive for revenue led it to take more risks than it should have. The report was released two days before a shareholder meeting where bank executives are expected to seek permission to shore up the balance sheet by $14.7 billion more. PAGE C3 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MORE LUGGAGE, LIGHTER WALLET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five of the six major airlines in the United States plan to start charging coach passengers as much as $25 to check a second bag, the latest move in their quest to offset high fuel prices. Airlines say they expect the fees will primarily affect leisure travelers; business travelers beg to differ. ''For people traveling with samples or trade show materials, they're going to find their costs are substantially higher,'' an airline industry analyst said.  PAGE C8 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why a Star Is Struggling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andruw Jones is a five-time All-Star center fielder, but he hasn't looked like one much lately. Since arriving as a free agent as a Los Angeles Dodger this off-season, he has struggled mightily, batting .169 with one home run through 18 games. Some think he's in decline. Jones, though, points to 2005, another season that started off as rockily as this one -- in which he finished with 51 home runs and was the runner-up for the National League Most Valuable Player award.  PAGE C17</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A RARE CHANCE TO RUN THE TABLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Trinity College Bantams are inching toward an unprecedented feat: an undefeated season in college baseball. Last week, the tiny Connecticut college got a scare after it trailed Tufts 8-1 after four innings, before coming back to win 17-10 in extra innings. If the Bantams defeat perennial power Eastern Connecticut State on Tuesday, they will have a very real shot of running the table. ''It's scary to think of,'' said Matthew Sullivan, Trinity's center fielder. ''We know we can do it. We don't talk about it. But in our minds, there's no reason we should lose a game.''

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the stroke of a finger, John King has been able to traverse hundreds of miles across states on big primary nights, zooming in and out of towns and cities on an enormous touch map to collect and display the latest results for CNN this campaign season. The Democratic race has cemented his, and his touch screen's, status as a prime-time cable television star.  PAGE B1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SCRIPTED REALITY OF AMERICAN IDOL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Determining the winner is about the only part of ''American Idol'' left to chance. That was made clear during visits to Stage 36, near Hollywood, where the show is filmed. From the placement of sorority girls along camera sight lines to the instructions to the audience about how to wave their hands, ''American Idol'' is as scripted as a ''reality'' show dare be.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stage version of ''Billy Elliot'' is set to land on Broadway in the fall. The show demands its main character be on stage for nearly three hours, so the plan is for three boys to rotate in and out of the role. The lucky three were recently in New York, performing stunts with fried mozzarella sticks. Ladies and gentlemen: your Billy Elliots. PAGE B1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AUTHORS SEE GENERATIONAL SHIFT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais, the authors of ''Millennial Makeover: MySpace, YouTube, and the Future of American Politics,'' tectonic realignment is on its way, and it will lead to a fundamental shift in policy priorities and voter coalitions. But the volume is not as persuasive as it is fascinating, Michiko Kakutani writes. The authors' unalloyed faith in their paradigms seems to leave little room for the accidents of fate and free will.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why does one person live longer or remain healthier than her identical twin? In an excerpt from his ''Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life,'' Carl Zimmer writes that even organisms with the same DNA -- like self-cloning E. coli -- have different ways of responding to the same stimuli, and that simple genetic determinism is an imperfect lens through which to view human nature.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These days, free divers regularly hold their breaths for much longer than Houdini ever could (even a novice like John Tierney could crack three minutes with a little coaching). The ability to go without air for long stretches is an ability humans share with other mammals, like dolphins, seals and otters. David Blaine, the magician, is attempting to break the world record for breath holding -- a little over 16 minutes.  PAGE D1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel Gilbert, the Harvard social psychologist, is known as Professor Happiness for his work studying the nature of human happiness. He says that people tend to react more moderately to good events and bad events than they predict they will. ''So the good news is that going blind is not going to make you as unhappy as you think it will,'' Mr. Gilbert writes. ''The bad news is that winning the lottery will not make you as happy as you expect.''  PAGE D2</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Melodic intonation therapy is a rehabilitation technique that helps stroke sufferers learn to speak again -- by teaching them how to make sing-song sentences with familiar tunes and then work on removing the melody. Scientists stimulate the right side of the brain, which processes rhythm and melody, to train it to take over for the damaged part of the brain's left side, which controls speech and language.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials are making it increasingly clear that they have no interest in stopping cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by militants into Afghanistan, prompting a new level of frustration from Americans who see the infiltration as a crucial strategic priority in the war in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday night, the United States fired its fourth Predator missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since January, the most visible symbol of the American push for a freer hand to  pursue militants from Al Qaeda and the Taliban  who use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afghanistan and plot terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> abroad. In Afghanistan, cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have doubled over the same month last year and present an increasingly lethal challenge to American and NATO efforts to wind down the war and deny the Taliban and Al Qaeda a sanctuary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an unusual step during a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in March, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the commander of United States Special Operations Command, held a round-table discussion with a group of civilian Pakistani leaders to sound them out on the possibility of cross-border raids by American forces. He was told in no uncertain terms that from the Pakistani point of view it was a bad idea, said one of the participants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, Pakistani officials are trying to restore calm to their country, which was rattled by a record number of suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year. Within days, they are expected to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a peace accord with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own militants that makes no mention of stopping the infiltrations. In fact, Pakistani counterinsurgency operations have stopped during the new government's negotiations with the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take care of its own problems, you take care of Afghanistan on your side,'' said Owari Ghani, the governor of North-West Frontier Province, who is also President Pervez Musharraf's representative in charge of the neighboring tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ghani, a key architect of the pending peace accord, believes along with many other Pakistani leaders that the United States is floundering in the war in Afghanistan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, should not be saddled with America's mistakes, especially if a solution involved breaching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty, a delicate  matter in a nation where sentiment against the Bush administration runs high. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a sovereign state,'' he said. ''NATO is in Afghanistan; it's time they did some soldiering.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pending accord, Pakistani officials said, is aimed at stopping suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which became a focus of the militants' wrath last year as the Pakistani government pursued a more assertive policy against them at the urging of the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials in Washington said the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday killed a handful of Qaeda militants, including one they described as a ''significant leader.'' The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> indicated that the C.I.A. retained some freedom to operate in the tribal areas. But as the gap between Pakistani and American policies widens, United States officials are pushing harder for still more latitude. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his visit to North-West Frontier Province, Admiral Olson was taken to the military headquarters of the 14th Division of the Pakistani Army in Dera Ismail Khan, an area just outside the tribal region, where he was struck by the extent of the anti-Taliban sentiment, Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, in the talks, which were organized by the United States Consulate here in late March, the civilian leaders said they advised the Americans against fighting in Pakistani territory populated by Pashtuns. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government has long been wary of nationalist and separatist strains among the Pashtuns, whose population straddles the Pakistani-Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I said it would be extremely dangerous,'' Khalid Aziz, a former chief secretary of North-West Frontier Province, said he told Admiral Olson. ''It would increase the number of militants, it would be a war of liberation for the Pashtuns. They would say: 'We are being slaughtered. Our enemy is the United States.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials from the Special Operations Command or those at the embassy here would not agree to interviews about the meetings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week John D. Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state, used perhaps the strongest language yet against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying that the United States found it ''unacceptable'' that extremists used the tribal areas to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Afghanistan, the rest of the world and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will not be satisfied until the violent extremism emanating from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas is brought under control,'' Mr. Negroponte told the National Endowment  for  Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier this month, Afrasiab Khattak and Asfandyar Wali Khan, the leaders of the Awami National Party, which leads the government in the North-West Frontier Province, met with Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, and Mr. Negroponte in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In their meetings, Mr. Khattak said, it was hard to deter the Americans from the notion of launching their own operations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The topic came up ''again and again,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans specifically mentioned their concern that Qaeda operatives in the tribal areas were preparing an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We told them physical intervention into the tribal areas by the United States would be a blunder,'' Mr. Khattak said. ''It would create an atmosphere in which the terrorists would rally'' popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NATO and the United States say cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at Afghan and NATO troops have risen from 20 a month in March 2007 to 53 last month. The United States is particularly concerned about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because they appear to be aimed at Canadian and Dutch troops, whose governments are under pressure to withdraw from the NATO war effort. A new contingent of United States marines has arrived in southern Afghanistan, increasing the concern about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pending peace accord with the militants shows where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and American interests diverge. The accord, between the Pakistani authorities and the strongest Pakistani militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud, makes no mention of banning cross-border raids into Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The agreement with Mr. Mehsud, who is accused by the Pakistani government of having masterminded the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, has also alarmed Washington because it fails to call for the rapid expulsion of foreign fighters from Arab countries, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, which make up the backbone of Al Qaeda and its allies in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ghani, the governor, said the accord covering the tribal agency of South Waziristan served </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interests because it gave space to restore the relative stability of pre-9/11, and to amicably break down the rule of the militants. But where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants time, the United States wants action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ghani suggested that the NATO troops use ''daisy cutter bombs when they go over to Afghanistan.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Aziz and Mr. Khattak criticized sending American forces into the tribal areas, both men also blamed the Pakistani Army, which was first sent to the tribal areas at American insistence in 2002. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the 100,000 soldiers are from the Punjab, the largest and most sophisticated province of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They feel like foreigners in the impoverished tribal areas, and are treated as such. Their training in conventional warfare has been a liability against the more limber militants. Under such conditions, Mr. Aziz said, the army had been reduced to a mass of ''demoralized, quivering flesh.'' They had taken a ''bad beating,'' and were just waiting to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, he said, more than 200 tribal leaders, the men who provided the glue to keep the society together, had been killed by the militants over the last several years. A respected tribal leader known for his antimilitant views, Ahmad Khan Kukikhel, was killed Wednesday after his car was stopped by gunmen on the road in the Khyber agency. His friends said they were convinced the Taliban had attacked him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus, the militants which until recently had been holed up in the two tribal agencies North Waziristan and South Waziristan are now arrayed across the tribal areas, and had spread into some pockets outside. ''The agreement basically means appeasement,'' Mr. Aziz said. ''It's a serious problem,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militant leader, Mr. Mehsud, who heads an alliance of groups known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, knew that the army would leave him alone to build up his strength, Mr. Aziz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A key to isolating the militants, Mr. Khattak said, is to allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> major political parties to operate in the tribal areas. Under the complicated archaic rules of governing  over the tribal areas, The parties are forbidden in the region, making it difficult to provide a viable alternative to the standoff between the government and the militants, he said. To ease that difficulty, his party, the Awami National Party, favors combining the North-West Frontier Province and the tribal areas into one entity, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a sign of how favorably the militants look upon the accord, a spokesman for Mr. Mehsud in Damadola, the town where on Wednesday the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 18 people, said Thursday that the deal should go ahead despite the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials said that militants gathered in a house were among the dead. It was not clear whether well-known foreign militants were among those killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The town, about 100 miles from Peshawar, is the same place where a similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2006 was aimed at Ayman al-Zawahri, the deputy to Osama bin Laden. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was little reported at the time. A suicide bombing on March 3 killed two NATO soldiers and two Afghan civilians and wounded 19 others in an American military base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was only weeks later, when Taliban militants put out a propaganda DVD, that the implications of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became clear. The DVD shows an enormous  explosion, with shock waves rippling out far beyond the base. As a thick cloud of dust rises, the face of Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani, a Taliban commander who presents one of the biggest threats to NATO and United States forces, appears. He taunts his opponents and derides rumors of his demise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Now as you see I am still alive,'' he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrates  the persistence of the Afghan insurgency and the way former mujahedeen leaders, like Maulavi Haqqani, combine tactics and forces with Al Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a renewed sense of crisis grips the war here, fueled by reports on Monday that Taliban had overrun districts in southern Afghanistan after a huge jailbreak last week, these new networks have given the insurgents a broader pool of recruits and added power and sophistication to their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American military officials say.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber in the March </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for instance, turned out to be a German citizen of Turkish origin who was trained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to European officials in Kabul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The combined terrorist-insurgent networks have flourished from sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In a sign of the increasing frustration of the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, with the challenges to his government, he threatened on Sunday to send Afghan troops into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hit militant leaders who have vowed to continue a jihad in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The combination of sanctuary in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, deep links on both sides of the border and steady support from Arab and other jihadist networks has made Maulavi Haqqani a formidable threat to the stability of Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Haqqani network is suspected of being behind three large vehicle suicide bombings in eastern Afghanistan this year, the latest on June 4. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Afghan security officials say one of his senior lieutenants masterminded a multipronged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Serena Hotel in Kabul that killed seven people in January, as well as the assassination attempt on Mr. Karzai in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A quarter-century ago, Maulavi Haqqani was a favorite of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and of wealthy Arab benefactors because of his effectiveness in organizing mujahedeen fighters from Afghanistan, Arab nations and other Muslim regions to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Soviet forces that had occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today he has turned his expertise against American and NATO forces. From his base in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the aging Maulavi Haqqani has maintained a decades-old association with Osama bin Laden and other Arabs. Together with his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani, 34, he and these allies now share a common mission to again drive foreign forces from Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas of North and South Waziristan, Maulavi Haqqani and his son run a network of madrasas and training bases and provide protection for foreign fighters and terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They also provide logistics and intelligence for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan, according to a United States military public affairs officer, Sgt. Timothy Dinneen, who is based at Bagram air base in Afghanistan and wrote a paper on the Haqqanis last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another United States military spokesman, Maj. Chris Belcher, accused the Haqqanis of bringing foreign fighters from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, Turkey and Middle Eastern countries into Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maulavi Haqqani's old ties keep his insurgent ranks flush with men and money, the American officials said, as do arms and smuggling rackets they control within their fief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Pakistani forces have been reluctant to move against the Haqqanis. According to European officials and one senior Pakistani official, Maulavi Haqqani has maintained his old links with Pakistani intelligence and still enjoys their protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked in 2006 why the Pakistani military did not move against Maulavi Haqqani, a senior Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that it was because he was a Pakistani asset. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maulavi Haqqani has by now become so powerful in his redoubt that a Western military official who has worked in both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan said the problem of going after him was that the Pakistani military was not capable of taking him on and feared failure if it tried. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani forces accompanied by Americans raided a mosque owned by Maulavi Haqqani while searching for him in North Waziristan in 2002, but since then he has been largely left alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Western military official said there was an unspoken agreement between Pakistani and American officials that United States Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would generally be used in the tribal areas against foreign Qaeda members, rather than Pakistani or Afghan targets, like the Haqqanis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Maulavi Haqqani has aged, his son has increasingly taken over military operations from his father and, according to the United States military, has expanded his father's connections with foreign financing and fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One example may be the bomber in the March 3 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahed, in a telephone interview, identified the bomber as Muhammad Beg and said he had volunteered, traveling from Turkey to join Maulavi Haqqani. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As men from Muslim countries usually do, he came willingly to join Afghan Muslims and carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the non-Muslim  invaders,'' Mr. Mujahed said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  German investigators have taken the German-Turkish link seriously, according to the German news media. Suicide bombings have been widely used in the conflicts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan in recent years, but Mr. Beg is the first known German suicide bomber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group claiming responsibility for his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Islamic Jihad Union, which is affiliated with Al Qaeda, seems to have acquired some Turkish German recruits whom they trained in Waziristan for terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to Guido Steinberg, an expert in Islamic studies at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Haqqanis have given shelter to such groups. Last October, Sergeant Dinneen, the public affairs officer, warned in a lengthy press release that the younger Haqqani had expanded his father's original operating areas from the border provinces to other areas in northern, central and southern Afghanistan, including Kandahar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His close connections with Al Qaeda have enabled him to accumulate more financial support from Middle Eastern countries and have created a larger recruiting pool of fighters from other countries,'' the sergeant wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Queried in May, a United States military spokeswoman said the Haqqani network had formed a syndicate with other, unspecified groups. Their goal was to ''destabilize Afghanistan,'' the spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rumi Nielson-Green, public affairs officer for American forces in Afghanistan, wrote in an e-mail statement from Bagram air base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The DVD on the March </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to be a rare attempt by Maulavi Haqqani, who looks to be well into his 60s, to answer his opponents and dispel months of reports that he was dead or sick and that he had ceded control of his network to his son. He pointedly rebuts those rumors and claims to have been at the scene of the March 3 suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which was at the site of the government's office in the Sabari district of the eastern Afghan province of Khost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was present two or three days ago when we started operations on Sabari district,'' he says. ''And now I am present by the grace of God.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His voice quavers, and at one point his arm shakes as if from Parkinson's disease. But he places blame for rumors of his death on propaganda put out by the United States military and its NATO allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He specifically mentions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a hotel -- possibly the January </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Serena in Kabul -- and on the Sabari district base, making it clear that he has espoused Al Qaeda's most ruthless of tactics, suicide bombing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suicide bombing was unheard of in Afghanistan before 2001 and remains controversial, even among Taliban commanders. Many Afghans consider it to be contrary to Islam and to the tribal Pashtuns' code of honor. Maulavi Haqqani's embrace of it demonstrates the increasingly powerful sway Al Qaeda holds over him and other Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will fight them with patience,'' Maulavi Haqqani says on the DVD. ''This is not a battle of haste; this is a battle of patience. If a strong animal fights with a small and weak animal, the big animal uses all its power, not against the enemy, but against itself.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year, top Bush administration officials decided to take a step they had long resisted. They drafted a secret plan to make it easier for the Pentagon's Special Operations forces to launch missions into the snow-capped mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to capture or kill top leaders of Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence reports for more than a year had been streaming in about Osama bin Laden's terrorism network rebuilding in the Pakistani tribal areas, a problem that had been exacerbated by years of missteps in Washington and the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, sharp policy disagreements, and turf battles between American counterterrorism agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plan, outlined in a highly classified Pentagon order, was intended to eliminate some of those battles. And it was meant to pave a smoother path into the tribal areas for American commandos, who for years have bristled at what they see as Washington's risk-averse attitude toward Special Operations missions inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They also argue that catching Mr. bin Laden will come only by capturing some of his senior lieutenants alive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But more than six months later, the Special Operations forces are still waiting for the green light. The plan has been held up in Washington by the very disagreements it was meant to eliminate. A senior Defense Department official said there was ''mounting frustration'' in the Pentagon at the continued delay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bush committed the nation to a ''war on terrorism'' and made the destruction of Mr. bin Laden's network the top priority of his presidency. But it is increasingly clear that the Bush administration will leave office with Al Qaeda having successfully relocated its base from Afghanistan to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, where it has rebuilt much of its ability to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the region and broadcast its messages to militants across the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A recent American airstrike killing Pakistani troops has only inflamed tensions along the mountain border and added to tensions between Washington and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The story of how Al Qaeda, whose name is Arabic for ''the base,'' has gained a new haven is in part a story of American accommodation to President Pervez Musharraf of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose advisers played down the terrorist threat. It is also a story of how the White House shifted its sights, beginning in 2002, from counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to preparations for the war in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just as it had on the day before 9/11, Al Qaeda now has a band of terrorist camps from which to plan and train for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Western targets, including the United States. Officials say the new camps are smaller than the ones the group used prior to 2001. However, despite dozens of American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since 2002, one retired C.I.A. officer estimated that the makeshift training compounds now have as many as 2,000 local and foreign militants, up from several hundred three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Publicly, senior American and Pakistani officials have said that the creation of a Qaeda haven in the tribal areas was in many ways inevitable -- that the lawless badlands where ethnic Pashtun tribes have resisted government control for centuries were a natural place for a dispirited terrorism network to find refuge. The American and Pakistani officials also blame a disastrous cease-fire brokered between the Pakistani government and militants in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But more than four dozen interviews in Washington and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tell another story. American intelligence officials say that the Qaeda hunt in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, code-named Operation Cannonball by the C.I.A. in 2006, was often undermined by bitter disagreements within the Bush administration and within the C.I.A., including about whether American commandos should launch ground raids inside the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside the C.I.A., the fights included clashes between the agency's outposts in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Islamabad. There were also battles between field officers and the Counterterrorist Center at C.I.A. headquarters, whose preference for carrying out raids remotely, via Predator missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was derided by officers in the Islamabad station as the work of ''boys with toys.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An early arrangement that allowed American commandos to join Pakistani units on raids inside the tribal areas was halted in 2003 after protests in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Another combat mission that came within hours of being launched in 2005 was scuttled because some C.I.A. officials in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioned the accuracy of the intelligence, and because aides to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld believed that the mission force had become too large. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Current and former military and intelligence officials said that the war in Iraq consistently diverted resources and high-level attention from the tribal areas. When American military and intelligence officials requested additional Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to survey the tribal areas, they were told no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were available because they had been sent to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some former officials say Mr. Bush should have done more to confront Mr. Musharraf, by aggressively demanding that he acknowledge the scale of the militant threat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western military officials say Mr. Musharraf was instead often distracted by his own political problems, and effectively allowed militants to regroup by brokering peace agreements with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even critics of the White House agree that there was no foolproof solution to gaining control of the tribal areas. But by most accounts the administration failed to develop a comprehensive plan to address the militant problem there, and never resolved the disagreements between warring agencies that undermined efforts to fashion any coherent strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're just kind of drifting,'' said Richard L. Armitage, who as deputy secretary of state from 2001 to 2005 was the administration's point person for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fleeing U.S. Air Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March 2002, several hundred bedraggled foreign fighters -- Uzbeks, Pakistanis and a handful of Arabs -- fled the towering mountains of eastern Afghanistan and crossed into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Waziristan tribal area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Savaged by American air power in the battles of Tora Bora and the Shah-i-Kot valley, some were trying to make their way to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf. Some were simply looking for a haven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They soon arrived at Shakai, a remote region in South Waziristan of tree-covered mountains and valleys. Venturing into nearby farming villages, they asked local tribesmen if they could rent some of the area's walled family compounds, paying two to three times the impoverished area's normal rates as the militants began to lay new roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They slowly, steadily from the mountainside tried to establish communication,'' recalled Mahmood Shah, the chief civilian administrator of the tribal areas from 2001 to 2005. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In many ways, the foreigners were returning to their home base. In the 1980s, Mr. bin Laden and hundreds of Arab and foreign fighters backed by the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used the tribal areas as a staging area for cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Soviet forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants' flight did not go unnoticed by American intelligence agencies, which began to report beginning in the spring of 2002 that large numbers of foreigners appeared to be hiding in South Waziristan and neighboring North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Gen. Ali Mohammad Jan Aurakzai, the commander of Pakistani forces in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was skeptical. In an interview this year, General Aurakzai recalled that he regarded the warnings as ''guesswork,'' and said that his soldiers ''found nothing,'' even when they pushed into dozens of square miles of territory that neither Pakistani nor British forces had ever entered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The general, a tall, commanding figure who was born in the tribal areas, was Mr. Musharraf's main adviser on the border areas, according to former Pakistani officials. For years, he would argue that American officials exaggerated the threat in the tribal areas and that the Pakistani Army should avoid causing a tribal rebellion at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former American intelligence officials said General Aurakzai's sweeps were slow-moving and easily avoided by militants. Robert L. Grenier, the C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad from 1999 to 2002, said that General Aurakzai was dismissive of the reports because he and other Pakistani officials feared the kind of tribal uprising that could have been touched off by more intrusive military operations. ''Aurakzai and others didn't want to believe it because it would have been an inconvenient fact,'' Mr. Grenier recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Signs of Militants Regrouping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until recent elections pushed Mr. Musharraf off center stage in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, senior Bush administration officials consistently praised his cooperation in the Qaeda hunt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beginning shortly after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Musharraf had allowed American forces to use Pakistani bases to support the American invasion of Afghanistan, while Pakistani intelligence services worked closely with the C.I.A. in tracking down Qaeda operatives. But from their vantage point in Afghanistan, the picture looked different to American Special Operations forces who saw signs that the militants whom the Americans had driven out of Afghanistan were effectively regrouping on the Pakistani side of the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When American military officials proposed in 2002 that Special Operations forces be allowed to establish bases in the tribal areas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flatly refused. Instead, a small number of ''black'' Special Operations forces -- Army Delta Force and Navy Seal units -- were allowed to accompany Pakistani forces on raids in the tribal areas in 2002 and early 2003. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That arrangement only angered both sides. American forces used to operating on their own felt that the Pakistanis were limiting their movements. And while Pakistani officials publicly denied the presence of Americans, local tribesmen spotted the Americans and protested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under pressure from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Bush administration decided in 2003 to end the American military presence on the ground. In a recent interview, Mr. Armitage said he had supported the pullback in recognition of the political risks that Mr. Musharraf had already taken. ''We were pushing them almost to the breaking point,'' Mr. Armitage said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American invasion of Iraq in 2003 added another complicating factor, by cementing a view among Pakistanis that American forces in the tribal areas would be a prelude to an eventual American occupation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To have insisted that American forces be allowed to cross from Afghanistan into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Armitage added, ''might have been a bridge too far.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dealing With Musharraf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush's re-election in 2004 brought with it another problem once the president overhauled his national security team. By early 2005, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Mr. Armitage had resigned, joining George J. Tenet, who had stepped down earlier as director of central intelligence. Their departures left the administration with no senior officials with close personal relationships with Mr. Musharraf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In order to keep pressure on the Pakistanis about the tribal areas, officials decided to have Mr. Bush raise the issue in personal phone calls with Mr. Musharraf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conversations backfired. Two former United States government officials say they were surprised and frustrated when instead of demanding action from Mr. Musharraf, Mr. Bush repeatedly thanked him for his contributions to the war on terrorism. ''He never pounded his fist on the table and said, 'Pervez you have to do this,' '' said a former senior intelligence official who saw transcripts of the phone conversations. But another senior administration official defended the president, saying Mr. Bush had not gone easy on the Pakistani leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would say the president pushes quite hard,'' said the official, who would speak about the confidential conversations only on condition of anonymity. At the same time, the official said Mr. Bush was keenly aware of the ''unique burden'' that rested on any head of state, and had the ability to determine ''what the traffic will bear'' when applying pressure to foreign leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions Within the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan by militants based in the tribal areas continued, tensions escalated between the C.I.A. stations in Kabul and Islamabad, whose lines of responsibility for battling terrorism were blurred by the porous border that divides Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and whose disagreements reflected animosities between the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along with the Afghan government, the C.I.A. officers in Afghanistan expressed alarm at what they saw as a growing threat from the tribal areas. But the C.I.A. officers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> played down the problem, to the extent that some colleagues in Kabul said their colleagues in Islamabad were ''drinking the Kool-Aid,'' as one former officer put it, by accepting Pakistani assurances that no one could control the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On several occasions, senior C.I.A. officials at agency headquarters had to intervene to dampen tensions between the dueling C.I.A. outposts. Other intragovernmental battles raged at higher altitudes, most notably over the plan in early 2005 for a Special Operations mission intended to capture Ayman al-Zawahri, Mr. bin Laden's top deputy, in what would have been the most aggressive use of American ground troops inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The New York Times disclosed the aborted operation in a 2007 article, but interviews since then have produced new details about the episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As described by current and former government officials, Mr. Zawahri was believed by intelligence officials to be attending a meeting at a compound in Bajaur, a tribal area, and the plan to send commandos to capture him had the support of Porter J. Goss, the C.I.A. director, and the Special Operations commander, Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even as members of the Navy Seals and Army Rangers in parachute gear were boarding C-130 cargo planes in Afghanistan, there were frenzied exchanges between officials at the Pentagon, Central Command and the C.I.A. about whether the mission was too risky. Some complained that the American commando force was too large, numbering more than 100, while others argued that the intelligence was from a single source and unreliable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Goss urged the military to carry out the mission, and some C.I.A. officials in Washington even tried to give orders to execute the raid without informing Ryan C. Crocker, then the American ambassador in Islamabad. But other C.I.A. officials were opposed to the raid, including a former officer who said in an interview that he had ''told the military guys that this thing was going to be the biggest folly since the Bay of Pigs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, the mission was aborted after Mr. Rumsfeld refused to give his approval for it. The decision remains controversial, with some former officials seeing the episode as a squandered opportunity to capture a figure who might have led the United States to Mr. bin Laden, while others dismiss its significance, saying that there had been previous false alarms and that there remained no solid evidence that Mr. Zawahri was present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bin Laden Hunt at Dead End</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By late 2005, many inside the C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia had reached the conclusion that their hunt for Mr. bin Laden had made little progress since Tora Bora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., who at the time ran the C.I.A.'s clandestine operations branch, decided in late 2005 to make a series of swift changes to the agency's counterterrorism operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He replaced Mr. Grenier, the former Islamabad station chief who in late 2004 took over as head of the agency's Counterterrorist Center. The two men had barely spoken for months, and some inside the agency believed this personality clash was beginning to affect C.I.A. operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Grenier had worked to expand the agency's counterterrorism focus, reinforcing operations in places like the Horn of Africa, Southeast Asia and North Africa. He also reorganized and renamed Alec Station, the secret C.I.A. unit formed in the 1990s to hunt Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Grenier believed that the Counterterrorist Center and Alec Station had both grown very rapidly since 2001 and needed to be restructured to eliminate overlap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Rodriguez believed that the Qaeda hunt had lost its focus on Mr. bin Laden and the militant threat in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So he appointed a new head of the Counterterrorist Center, who has not been publicly identified, and sent dozens more C.I.A. operatives to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The new push was called Operation Cannonball, and Mr. Rodriguez demanded urgency, but the response had a makeshift air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was nowhere to house an expanding headquarters staff, so giant Quonset huts were erected outside the cafeteria on the C.I.A.'s leafy Virginia campus to house a new team assigned to the bin Laden mission. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the new operation was staffed not only with C.I.A. operatives drawn from around the world, but also with recent graduates of ''the Farm,'' the agency's training center at Camp Peary in Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We had to put people out in the field who had less than ideal levels of experience,'' one former senior C.I.A. official said. ''But there wasn't much to choose from.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One reason for this, according to two former intelligence officials directly involved in the Qaeda hunt, was that by 2006 the Iraq war had drained away most of the C.I.A. officers with field experience in the Islamic world. ''You had a very finite number'' of experienced officers, said one former senior intelligence official. ''Those people all went to Iraq. We were all hurting because of Iraq.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Surge in Suicide Bombings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increase had little impact in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where militants only continued to gain strength. In the spring of 2006, Taliban leaders based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched an offensive in southern Afghanistan, increasing suicide bombings by sixfold and American and NATO casualty rates by 45 percent. At the same time, they assassinated tribal elders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were cooperating with the government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once again, Pakistani Army units launched a military campaign in the tribal areas. Once again, they suffered heavy casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And once again, Mr. Musharraf turned to General Aurakzai to deal with the problem. Having retired from the Pakistani Army, General Aurakzai had become the governor of North-West Frontier Province, and he immediately began negotiating with the militants. On Sept. 5, 2006, General Aurakzai signed a truce with militants in North Waziristan, one in which the militants agreed to surrender to local tribes and carry out no further </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To help sell Washington on the deal, Mr. Musharraf brought General Aurakzai to the Oval Office several weeks later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a presentation to Mr. Bush, General Aurakzai advocated a strategy that would rely even more heavily on cease-fires, and said striking deals with the Taliban inside Afghanistan could allow American forces to withdraw from Afghanistan within seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the cease-fire in Waziristan had disastrous consequences. In the months after the agreement was signed, cross-border incursions from the tribal areas into Afghanistan rose by 300 percent. Some American officials began to refer to General Aurakzai as a ''snake oil salesman.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Rising Terror Threat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the fall of 2006, the top American commander in Afghanistan had had enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence reports were painting an increasingly dark picture of the terrorism threat in the tribal areas. But with senior Bush administration officials consumed for much of that year with the spiraling violence in Iraq, the Qaeda threat in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not at the top of the White House agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush had declared in a White House news conference that fall that Al Qaeda was ''on the run.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To get Washington's attention, the commander, Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, ordered military officers, Special Operations forces and C.I.A. operatives to assemble a dossier showing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> role in allowing militants to establish a haven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Behind the general's order was a broader feeling of outrage within the military -- at a terrorist war that had been outsourced to an unreliable ally, and at the grim fact that America's most deadly enemy had become stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For months, military officers inside a walled-off compound at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, where a branch of the military's classified Joint Special Operations Command is based, had grown increasingly frustrated at what they saw as missed opportunities in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American commanders had been pressing for much of 2006 to get approval from Mr. Rumsfeld for an operation to capture Sheik Saiid al-Masri, a top Qaeda operator and paymaster whom American intelligence had been tracking in the Pakistani mountains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rumsfeld and his staff were reluctant to approve the mission, worried about possible American military casualties and a popular backlash in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, in November 2006, Mr. Rumsfeld approved a plan for Navy Seal and Army Delta Force commandos to move into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and capture Mr. Masri. But the operation was put on hold days later, after Mr. Rumsfeld was pushed out of the Pentagon, a casualty of the Democratic sweep of the 2006 election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When General Eikenberry presented his dossier to several members of Mr. Bush's cabinet, some inside the State Department and the C.I.A. dismissed the briefing as exaggerated and simplistic. But the White House took note of his warnings, and decided to send Vice President Dick Cheney to Islamabad in March 2007, along with Stephen R. Kappes, the deputy C.I.A. director, to register American concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That visit was the beginning of a more aggressive effort by the administration to pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government into stepping up its fight. The decision last year to draw up the Pentagon order authorizing for a Special Operations campaign in the tribal areas was part of that effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the fact that the order remains unsigned reflects the infighting that persists. Administration lawyers and State Department officials are concerned about any new authorities that would allow military missions to be launched without the approval of the American ambassador in Islamabad. With Qaeda operatives now described in intelligence reports as deeply entrenched in the tribal areas and immersed in the civilian population, there is also a view among some military and C.I.A. officials that the opportunity for decisive American action against the militants may have been lost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani military officials, meanwhile, express growing frustration with the American pressure, and point out that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has lost more than 1,000 members of its security forces in the tribal areas since 2001, nearly double the number of Americans killed in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some architects of America's efforts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defend the Bush administration's record in the tribal areas, and vigorously deny that Washington took its eye off the terrorist threat as it focused on Iraq policy. Some also question whether Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri, Al Qaeda's top two leaders, are really still able to orchestrate large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I do wonder if it's in fact the case that Al Qaeda has really reconstituted itself to a pre-9/11 capability, and in fact I would say I seriously doubt that,'' said Mr. Crocker, the American ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> between 2004 and 2006 and currently the ambassador to Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Their top-level leadership is still out there, but they're not communicating and they're not moving around. I think they're symbolic more than operationally effective,'' Mr. Crocker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while Mr. Bush vowed early on that Mr. bin Laden would be captured ''dead or alive,'' the moment in late 2001 when Mr. bin Laden and his followers escaped at Tora Bora was almost certainly the last time the Qaeda leader was in American sights, current and former intelligence officials say. Leading terrorism experts have warned that it is only a matter of time before a major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned in the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is carried out on American soil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The United States faces a threat from Al Qaeda today that is comparable to what it faced on Sept. 11, 2001,'' said Seth Jones, a Pentagon consultant and a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The base of operations has moved only a short distance, roughly the difference from New York to Philadelphia.''  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's getting harder and harder to remain deluded. With each day comes new facts to drag our heads out of the sand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two weeks ago, The Times reported that four Western oil giants were on the verge of signing no-bid contracts that would return them to Iraq, the third-most bountiful petroleum playground on the planet.  The deals, expected to be finalized in the next 30 days, were the kind of news that big oil lives for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Giddy executives singing ''Oh Happy Day'' could be heard in the corporate offices of Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total and BP, which had been shut out of Iraq for three and a half decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We also learned this week that a group of American advisers, led by a team from the State Department, played a key role in drawing up the contracts between the companies and the Iraqi government. Chevron and several smaller oil companies are also on the verge of signing  contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Bush and Vice President Cheney, both former oil-company executives, have long tried to tell us this war was about terrorism, about weapons of mass destruction, about bringing freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people, about anything but oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Said Mr. Bush: ''We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He didn't wait. It didn't matter that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the U.S. Or that Iraq had nothing to do with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, 2001. The troops were sent into battle in early 2003 and there is still, after more than five years and more than 4,000 American deaths, no end to the war in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the starkest examples of U.S. priorities came during the eruption of looting that followed the fall of Baghdad. With violence and chaos all about, American troops were ordered to protect one particularly treasured target -- the Iraqi Oil Ministry. As David Rieff wrote in The Times Magazine in November 2003:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This decision to protect only the Oil Ministry -- not the National Museum, not the National Library, not the Health Ministry -- probably did more than anything else to convince Iraqis uneasy with the occupation that the United States was in Iraq only for the oil.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How convenient that the peculiar perspective of the oil-obsessed Bush administration can now be put to use advising the Iraqi government on its  contracts with big oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contracts themselves are not huge. They are like the keys on a coveted ring that will begin opening the doors to Iraq's vast oil reserves. As The Times reported Monday, ''At a time of spiraling oil prices, the no-bid contracts, in a country with some of the world's largest untapped fields and potential for vast profits, are a rare prize to the industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A prize, yes. But at what cost?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the terrible toll of Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded, the war in Iraq has diverted attention and resources from critical problems here in the U.S., where the housing market has been crippled, the stock market has tanked, gasoline has soared past $4 per gallon, unemployment is increasing and an extraordinary number of debt-ridden working families are staring into a financial abyss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as oil companies are enjoying staggering profits, many Americans -- in July! -- are already worried sick about the potentially ruinous cost of heating their homes next winter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then there's the so-called war on terror. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest news is that Al Qaeda, the terror network that actually did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the U.S., has successfully regrouped in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has reconstituted its ability to institute terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For an administration joined at the hip to the oil industry, the lure of Iraq's enormous reserves was stronger even than the impulse to conquer an enemy that murdered more than 2,700 civilians on Sept. 11, a toll greater than the number of Americans killed by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Referring to Al Qaeda members who regrouped in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, The Times reported on Monday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Current and former military and intelligence officials said that the war in Iraq consistently diverted resources and high-level attention from the tribal areas. When American military and intelligence officials requested additional Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to survey the tribal areas, they were told no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were available because they had been sent to Iraq.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who knows how long it will be before the U.S. disengages in any significant way from Iraq. What you can take to the bank is that this country will not make any major advances in energy policy, in health coverage, in rebuilding its infrastructure, in improving its public schools or in curtailing runaway public and private debt until our open-ended commitment to this catastrophic multitrillion-dollar war comes to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How long will it take before that finally sinks in? </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE know what a criminal White House looks like from ''The Final Days,'' Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's classic account of Richard Nixon's unraveling. The cauldron of lies, paranoia and illegal surveillance boiled over, until  it was finally every man for himself as desperate courtiers scrambled to save their reputations and, in a few patriotic instances, their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Final Days'' was published in 1976, two years after Nixon abdicated in disgrace. With the Bush presidency, no journalist (or turncoat White House memoirist) is waiting for the corpse to be carted away. The latest and perhaps most chilling example arrives this week from Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, long a relentless journalist on the war-on-terror torture beat. Her book ''The Dark Side'' connects the dots of her own past reporting and that of her top-tier colleagues (including James Risen and Scott Shane of The New York Times) to portray a White House that, like its prototype, savaged its enemies within almost as ferociously as it did the Constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of ''The Dark Side'' seems right out of ''The Final Days,'' minus Nixon's operatic boozing and weeping. We learn, for instance, that in 2004 two conservative Republican Justice Department officials had become ''so paranoid'' that ''they actually thought they might be in physical danger.'' The fear of being wiretapped by their own peers drove them to speak in code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men were John Ashcroft's deputy attorney general, James Comey, and an assistant attorney general, Jack Goldsmith. Their sin was to challenge the White House's don, Dick Cheney, and his consigliere, his chief of staff David Addington, when they circumvented the Geneva Conventions to make torture the covert law of the land. Mr. Comey and Mr. Goldsmith failed to stop the ''torture memos'' and are long gone from the White House. But Vice President Cheney and Mr. Addington remain enabled by a president, attorney general (Michael Mukasey) and C.I.A. director (Michael Hayden) who won't shut the door firmly on torture even now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nixon parallels take us only so far, however. ''The Dark Side'' is scarier than ''The Final Days'' because these final days aren't over yet and because the stakes are much higher. Watergate was all about a paranoid president's narcissistic determination to cling to power at any cost. In Ms. Mayer's portrayal of the Bush White House, the president is a secondary, even passive, figure, and the motives invoked by Mr. Cheney to restore Nixon-style executive powers are theoretically selfless. Possessed by the ticking-bomb scenarios of television's ''24,'' all they want to do is protect America from further terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So what if they cut corners, the administration's last defenders argue. While prissy lawyers insist on habeas corpus and court-issued wiretap warrants, the rest of us are being kept safe by the Cheney posse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But are we safe? As Al Qaeda and the Taliban surge this summer, that single question is even more urgent than the moral and legal issues attending torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On those larger issues, the evidence is in, merely awaiting adjudication. Mr. Bush's 2005 proclamation that ''we do not torture'' was long ago revealed as a lie. Antonio Taguba, the retired major general who investigated detainee abuse for the Army, concluded that ''there is no longer any doubt'' that ''war crimes were committed.'' Ms. Mayer uncovered another damning verdict: Red Cross investigators flatly told the C.I.A. last year that America was practicing torture and vulnerable to war-crimes charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top Bush hands are starting to get sweaty about where they left their fingerprints. Scapegoating the rotten apples at the bottom of the military's barrel may not be a slam-dunk escape route from accountability anymore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No wonder the former Rumsfeld capo, Douglas Feith, is trying to discredit a damaging interview he gave to the British lawyer Philippe Sands for another recent and essential book on what happened, ''Torture Team.'' After Mr. Sands previewed his findings in the May issue of Vanity Fair, Mr. Feith protested he had been misquoted -- apparently forgetting that Mr. Sands had taped the interview. Mr. Feith and Mr. Sands are scheduled to square off in a House hearing this Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So hot is the speculation that war-crimes trials will eventually follow in foreign or international courts that Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell's former chief of staff, has publicly advised Mr. Feith, Mr. Addington and Alberto Gonzales, among others, to ''never travel outside the U.S., except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel.'' But while we wait for the wheels of justice to grind slowly, there are immediate fears to tend. Ms. Mayer's book helps cement the case that America's use of torture has betrayed not just American values but our national security, right to the present day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In her telling, a major incentive for Mr. Cheney's descent into the dark side was to cover up for the Bush White House's failure to heed the Qaeda threat in 2001. Jack Cloonan, a special agent for the F.B.I.'s Osama bin Laden unit until 2002, told Ms. Mayer that Sept. 11 was ''all preventable.'' By March 2000, according to the C.I.A.'s inspector general, ''50 or 60 individuals'' in the agency knew that two Al Qaeda suspects -- soon to be hijackers -- were in America. But there was no urgency at the top. Thomas Pickard, the acting F.B.I. director in the summer of 2001, told Ms. Mayer that when he expressed his fears about the Qaeda threat to Mr. Ashcroft, the attorney general snapped, ''I don't want to hear about that anymore!'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 9/11, our government emphasized ''interrogation over due process,'' Ms. Mayer writes, ''to pre-empt future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before they materialized.'' But in reality torture may well be enabling future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not just because Abu Ghraib snapshots have been used as recruitment tools by jihadists. No less destructive are the false confessions inevitably elicited from tortured detainees. The avalanche of misinformation since 9/11 has compromised prosecutions, allowed other culprits to escape and sent the American military on wild-goose chases. The coerced ''confession'' to the murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to take one horrific example, may have been invented to protect the real murderer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The biggest torture-fueled wild-goose chase, of course, is the war in Iraq. Exhibit A, revisited in ''The Dark Side,'' is Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, an accused Qaeda commander whose torture was outsourced by the C.I.A. to Egypt. His fabricated tales of Saddam's biological and chemical W.M.D. -- and of nonexistent links between Iraq and Al Qaeda -- were cited by President Bush in his fateful Oct. 7, 2002, Cincinnati speech ginning up the war and by Mr. Powell in his subsequent United Nations presentation on Iraqi weaponry. Two F.B.I. officials told Ms. Mayer that Mr. al-Libi later explained his lies by saying: ''They were killing me. I had to tell them something.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That ''something'' was crucial in sending us into the quagmire that, five years later, has empowered Iran and compromised our ability to counter the very terrorists that torture was supposed to thwart. As The Times reported two weeks ago, Iraq has monopolized our military and intelligence resources to the point where we don't have enough predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or expert C.I.A. field agentsto survey the tribal areas where terrorists are amassing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Meanwhile, the threat to America from Al Qaeda is ''comparable to what it faced on Sept. 11, 2001,'' said Seth Jones, a RAND Corporation terrorism expert and Pentagon consultant. The difference between now and then is simply that the base of operations has moved, ''roughly the difference from New York to Philadelphia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet once again terrorism has fallen off America's map, landing at or near the bottom of voters' concerns in recent polls. There were major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in rapid succession last week in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Afghanistan (the deadliest in Kabul since we ''defeated'' the Taliban in 2001) and at the American consulate in Turkey. Who listened to this ticking time bomb? It's reminiscent of July 2001, when few noticed that the Algerian convicted of trying to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on the eve of the millennium testified that he had been trained in bin Laden's Afghanistan camps as part of a larger plot against America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In last Sunday's Washington Post, the national security expert Daniel Benjamin sounded an alarm about the ''chronic'' indecisiveness and poor execution of Bush national security policy as well as the continuinginadequacies of the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Benjamin must feel a sinking sense of deja vu. Exactly seven years ago in the same newspaper, just two months before 9/11, he co-wrote an article headlined ''Defusing a Time Bomb'' imploring the Bush administration in vain to pay attention to Afghanistan because that country's terrorists ''continue to pose the most dangerous threat to American lives.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so we're back where we started in the summer of 2001, with even shark </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Chandra Levy's murder (courtesy of a new Washington Post investigation) returning to the news. We are once again distracted and unprepared while the Taliban and bin Laden's minions multiply in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. This, no less than the defiling of the Constitution, is the legacy of an administration that not merely rationalized the immorality of torture but shackled our national security to the absurdity that torture could easily fix the terrorist threat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why the Bush White House's corruption in the end surpasses Nixon's. We can no longer take cold comfort in the Watergate maxim that the cover-up was worse than the crime. This time the crime is worse than the cover-up, and the punishment could rain down on us all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- As they complete their training at ''The Farm,'' the Central Intelligence Agency's base in the Virginia tidewater, young agency recruits are taught a lesson they are expected never to forget during assignments overseas: there is no such thing as a friendly intelligence service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign spy services, even those of America's closest allies, will try to manipulate you. So you had better learn how to manipulate them back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But most C.I.A. veterans agree that no relationship between the spy agency and a foreign intelligence service is quite as byzantine, or as maddening, as that between the C.I.A. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or I.S.I.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is like a bad marriage in which  both spouses have long stopped trusting each other, but would never think of breaking up because they have become so mutually dependent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without the I.S.I.'s help, American spies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be incapable of carrying out their primary mission in the country: hunting Islamic militants, including top members of Al Qaeda. Without the millions of covert American dollars sent annually to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the I.S.I. would have trouble competing with the spy service of its archrival, India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the relationship is complicated by a web of competing interests. First off, the top American goal in the region is to shore up Afghanistan's government and security services to better fight the I.S.I.'s traditional proxies, the Taliban, there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, America's  primary  interest is to dismantle a Taliban and Qaeda safe haven in the  mountainous tribal lands. Throughout the 1990s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and especially the I.S.I., used the Taliban and militants from those  areas to exert power in Afghanistan and block India from gaining influence there.  The I.S.I. has also supported other militant groups that launched operations against Indian troops in Kashmir, something that complicates Washington's efforts to stabilize the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, there  are few examples in history of spy services really trusting one another. After all, people who earn their salaries by lying and assuming false identities probably don't make the most reliable business partners. Moreover, spies know that the best way to steal secrets is to penetrate the ranks of another spy service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But circumstances have for years forced successful, if ephemeral, partnerships among spies. The Office of Strategic Services, the C.I.A.'s predecessor, worked with the K.G.B.'s predecessors to hunt Nazis during World War II, even as the United States and the Soviet Union were quickly becoming adversaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These days, the relationship between Moscow and Washington is turning frosty  again, over a number of issues. But, quietly, American and Russian spies continue to collaborate to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, and to secure nuclear arsenals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The relationship between the C.I.A. and the I.S.I. was far less complicated when the United and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were intently focused on one common  goal: kicking the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. For years in the 1980s, the C.I.A. used the I.S.I. as the conduit to funnel arms and money to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even in those good old days, the two spy services were far from trusting of each other -- in particular over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quest for nuclear weapons. In his book ''Ghost Wars,'' the journalist Steve Coll recounts how the I.S.I. chief in the early 1980s, Gen. Akhtar Abdur Rahman, banned all social contact between his I.S.I. officers and C.I.A. operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He was also convinced that the C.I.A. had set up an elaborate bugging network, so he had his officers speak in code on the telephone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the general and his aides were invited by the C.I.A. to visit agency training sites in the United States, the Pakistanis were forced to wear blindfolds on the flights into the facilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C.I.A. officers have arrived in Islamabad knowing they will probably depend on the I.S.I. at least as much as they have depended on any liaison spy service in the past.  Unlike spying in the capitals of Europe, where agency operatives can blend in to develop a network of informants, only a tiny fraction of C.I.A. officers can walk the streets of Peshawar unnoticed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And an even smaller fraction could move freely through the tribal areas to scoop up useful information about militant networks there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even the powerful I.S.I., which is dominated by Punjabis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest ethnic group, has  difficulties collecting information in the tribal lands, the home of fiercely independent Pashtun tribes. For this reason, the I.S.I. has long been forced to rely on Pashtun tribal leaders -- and in some cases Pashtun militants -- as key informants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the natural disadvantages, C.I.A. officers try to get any edge they can through technology, the one advantage they have over the local spies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, the Pakistani government has long restricted where the C.I.A. can fly Predator surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, limiting flight paths to approved ''boxes'' on a grid map. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A.'s answer to that restriction? It  deliberately  flies  Predators beyond the approved areas, just to test Pakistani radars. According to one former agency officer, the Pakistanis usually notice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As American and allied casualty rates in Afghanistan have grown in the last two years, the I.S.I. has become a subject of fierce debate within the C.I.A. Many in the spy agency -- particularly those stationed in Afghanistan -- accuse their agency colleagues at the Islamabad station of actually being too cozy with their I.S.I. counterparts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been bitter fights between the C.I.A. station chiefs in Kabul and Islamabad, particularly about the significance of the militant threat in the tribal areas. At times, the view from Kabul has been not only that the I.S.I. is actively aiding the militants, but that C.I.A. officers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refuse to confront the I.S.I. over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Veterans of the C.I.A. station in Islamabad point to the capture of a number of senior Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years as proof that the Pakistani intelligence service has often shown a serious commitment to roll up terror networks. It was the I.S.I., they say, that did much of the legwork leading to the capture of operatives like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, they point out, the I.S.I. has just as much reason to distrust the Americans as the C.I.A. has to distrust the I.S.I. The C.I.A. largely pulled up stakes in the region after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, rather than staying to resist the chaos and bloody civil war that led ultimately to the Taliban ascendance in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the withdrawal, the American tools to understand the complexity of relationships in Central and South Asia became rusty. The I.S.I. operates in a neighborhood of constantly shifting alliances, where double dealing is an accepted rule of the game, and the phenomenon is one that many in Washington still have problems accepting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until late last year, when he was elevated to the command of the entire army, the Pakistani spymaster who had been running  the I.S.I.  was Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. American officials describe this smart and urbane general as at once engaging and inscrutable, an avid golfer with occasionally odd affectations. During meetings, he will often spend several minutes carefully hand-rolling a cigarette. Then, after taking one puff, he stubs it out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grumbling at the C.I.A. about dealing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I.S.I. comes with a certain grudging reverence for the spy service's Machiavellianqualities. Some former spies even talk about the Pakistani agency with a mix of awe and professional jealousy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One senior C.I.A. official, recently retired, said that of all the foreign spymasters  the C.I.A. had dealt with, General Kayani was the most formidable and may have earned the most respect at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. The soft-spoken general, he said, is a master manipulator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We admire those traits,'' he said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Qaeda's success in forging close ties to Pakistani militant groups has given it   an increasingly secure haven in the mountainous tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the American government's senior terrorism analyst said Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda is more capable of attacking inside the United States than it was last year, and its cadre of senior leaders has recruited and trained ''dozens'' of militants capable of blending into Western society to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the analyst said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The remarks Tuesday by the intelligence analyst, Ted Gistaro, were the most comprehensive assessment of the Qaeda threat by an American official since the National Intelligence Estimate issued last summer, which concluded that Al Qaeda had largely rebuilt its haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A year later, Mr. Gistaro said, the problem has only grown worse, in part because of a symbiotic relationship between Qaeda operatives and Pakistani militant groups based in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is a stronger, more comfortable safe haven than it was for them a year ago,'' said Mr. Gistaro, who supervises all intelligence reports on terrorism at the National Intelligence Council. He made his remarks in a speech here to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda's growing strength inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has in recent months prompted new discussions in the Bush administration about using special-operations troops for raids in the tribal areas -- an option the White House has long resisted because of the risks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is also a growing recognition among senior officials that the Bush administration for years did not take the Qaeda threat in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seriously enough and relied on President Pervez Musharraf to dismantle networks of militants there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Musharraf was in control of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army and intelligence services until elections in February put a civilian government led by his opponents in charge in Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, senior Bush administration officials said much of Al Qaeda's resurgence was made possible by a disastrous cease-fire that Mr. Musharraf  brokered with tribal leaders in September 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the grim intelligence assessment Mr. Gistaro presented on Tuesday indicated that American spy agencies believed that the Qaeda threat metastasized long after that cease-fire ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past several days, militants have forced Pakistani troops to beat a hasty retreat from a Taliban stronghold in the tribal areas. Pakistani forces had tried to recapture a strategic military post in Bajaur, an area where Al Qaeda has forged particularly close ties with local militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military and intelligence officials believe that Pakistani militant networks are engaged in an increasingly violent campaign inside Afghanistan, attacking American and coalition troops as well as civilian targets like the Indian Embassy in Kabul, which a suicide bomber attacked last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American spy agencies have also concluded that officers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, which has long maintained ties to militants in the tribal areas, helped carry out the embassy bombing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gistaro did not address the ISI's relationship with Pakistani militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He did, however, cite a number of senior Qaeda leaders who had been killed in recent months as evidence of progress in the American-led campaign against Osama bin Laden's network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last month, American officials said a missile fired from a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the Central Intelligence Agency had killed Abu Khabab al-Masri, an Egyptian explosives expert who was operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, Mr. Gistaro said that Al Qaeda had ''replenished its bench'' with a more diverse group of operatives, many from North Africa and the Levant, as opposed to the cadre of Egyptians and Saudis who have historically dominated the group's upper ranks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gistaro said that Al Qaeda had trained several dozen operatives in Pakistani camps who would be capable of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Western targets; but he said that American intelligence agencies were not aware of any ''specific, credible plots'' to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the election and inauguration of a new president coming up, Mr. Gistaro said, intelligence officials expect a surge in threat reporting about possible domestic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> timed to the election would be aimed at wreaking havoc, rather than influencing the balloting in a particular direction, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no intelligence that suggests to me that Al Qaeda has a preferred candidate in our upcoming election,'' Mr. Gistaro said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I: The Border Incident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late in the afternoon of June 10, during a firefight with Taliban militants along the Afghan-Pakistani border, American soldiers called in airstrikes to beat back the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The firefight was taking place right on the border itself, known in military jargon as the ''zero line.'' Afghanistan was on one side, and the remote Pakistani region known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or FATA, was on the other. The stretch of border was guarded by three Pakistani military posts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American bombers did the job, and then some. By the time the fighting ended, the Taliban militants had slipped away, the American unit was safe and 11 Pakistani border guards lay dead. The airstrikes on the Pakistani positions sparked a diplomatic row between the two allies: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the incident ''unprovoked and cowardly''; American officials regretted what they called a tragic mistake. But even after a joint inquiry by the United States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, it remained unclear why American soldiers had reached the point of calling in airstrikes on soldiers from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a critical ally in the war in Afghanistan and the campaign against terrorism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mystery, at least part of it, was solved in July by four residents of Suran Dara, a Pakistani village a few hundred yards from the site of the fight. According to two of these villagers, whom I interviewed together with a local reporter, the Americans started calling in airstrikes on the Pakistanis after the latter started shooting at the Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When the Americans started bombing the Taliban, the Frontier Corps started shooting at the Americans,'' we were told by one of Suran Dara's villagers, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being persecuted or killed by the Pakistani government or the Taliban. ''They were trying to help the Taliban. And then the American planes bombed the Pakistani post.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years, the villagers said, Suran Dara served as a safe haven for jihadist fighters -- whether from Afghanistan or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or other countries -- giving them aid and shelter and a place to stash their weapons. With the firefight under way, one of Suran Dara's villagers dashed across the border into Afghanistan carrying a field radio with a long antenna (the villager called it ''a Motorola'') to deliver to the Taliban fighters. He never made it. The man with the Motorola was hit by an American bomb. After the fight, wounded Taliban members were carried into Suran Dara for treatment. ''Everyone supports the Taliban on both sides of the border,'' one of the villagers we spoke with said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, an American analyst briefed by officials in Washington confirmed the villagers' account. ''There have been dozens of incidents where there have been exchanges of fire,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That American and Pakistani soldiers are fighting one another along what was meant to be a border between allies highlights the extraordinarily chaotic situation unfolding inside the Pakistani tribal areas, where hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Taliban, along with Al Qaeda and other foreign fighters, enjoy freedom from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the incident also raises one of the more fundamental questions of the long war against Islamic militancy, and one that looms larger as the American position inside Afghanistan deteriorates: Whose side is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> really on? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">PAKISTAN'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WILD, LARGELY ungoverned tribal areas have become an untouchable base for Islamic militants to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans and Afghans across the border. Inside the tribal areas, Taliban warlords have taken near-total control, pushing aside the Pakistani government and imposing their draconian form of Islam. And for more than a year now, they have been sending suicide bombers against government and military targets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, killing hundreds of people. American and Pakistani investigators say they believe it was Baitullah Mehsud, the strongest of FATA's Taliban leaders, who dispatched assassins last December to kill Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister. With much of the North-West Frontier Province, which borders the tribal areas, also now under their control, the Taliban are increasingly in a position to threaten the integrity of the Pakistani state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is Al Qaeda. According to American officials and counterterrorism experts, the organization has rebuilt itself and is using its sanctuaries inside the tribal areas to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States and Europe. Since 2004, six major terrorist plots against Europe or the United States -- including the successful suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in London that killed 52 people in July 2005 -- have been traced back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, according to Bruce Hoffman, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University. Hoffman says he fears that Al Qaeda could be preparing a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before the American presidential election. ''I'm convinced they are planning something,'' he told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the center of all this stands the question of whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> really wants to control the Talibs and their Qaeda allies ensconced in the tribal areas -- and whether it really can. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was not supposed to be a major worry. After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, President Pervez Musharraf threw his lot in with the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has helped track down Al Qaeda suspects, launched a series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants inside the tribal areas -- a new offensive got under way just weeks ago -- and given many assurances of devotion to the antiterrorist cause. For such efforts, Musharraf and the Pakistani government have been paid handsomely, receiving more than $10 billion in American money since 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the incident on the Afghan border suggests, little in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is what it appears. For years, the survival of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and civilian leaders has depended on a double game: assuring the United States that they were vigorously repressing Islamic militants -- and in some cases actually doing so -- while simultaneously tolerating and assisting the same militants. From the anti-Soviet fighters of the 1980s and the Taliban of the 1990s to the homegrown militants of today, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders have been both public enemies and private friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the game works, it reaps great rewards: billions in aid to boost the Pakistani economy and military and Islamist proxies to extend the government's reach into Afghanistan and India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> double game has rested on two premises: that the country's leaders could keep the militants under control and that they could keep the United States sufficiently placated to keep the money and weapons flowing. But what happens when the game spins out of control? What happens when the militants you have been encouraging grow too strong and set their sights on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself? What happens when the bluff no longer works? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II. Being a Warlord</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late in June, to great fanfare, the Pakistani military began what it described as a decisive offensive to rout the Taliban from Khyber agency, one of seven tribal areas that make up the FATA. ''Forces Move In on Militants,'' declared a headline in Dawn, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most influential newspapers. Reporters were kept away, but footage on Pakistani television showed troops advancing behind trucks and troop carriers. The Americans were pleased. ''We think that's a positive development and certainly hope and expect that this government will continue,'' Tom Casey, the deputy spokesman at the State Department, said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The situation was serious indeed: Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province and just east of Khyber agency, was almost entirely surrounded by Taliban militias, which had begun making forays into the city. The encirclement of Peshawar was the culmination of the Taliban's advance: first they conquered the tribal areas, then much of the North-West Frontier Province, and now they were aiming for the province's capital itself. The Talibs were cutting their well-known medieval path: shutting girls' schools, banishing women from the streets, blowing up CD kiosks and beating barbers for shaving beards. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few days into the military operation, the photographer Lynsey Addario and I, dressed in traditional clothes and with a posse of gunmen protecting us, rode into Khyber agency ourselves. ''Entry by Foreigners Prohibited Beyond This Point,'' the sign said on the way in. As we drove past the dun-colored buildings and corrugated-tin shops, every trace of government authority vanished. No policemen, no checkpoints, no guards. Nothing to keep us from our appointment with the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a Friday afternoon, and our guides suggested we pull off the main road until prayers were over; local Taliban enforcers, they said, would not take kindly to anyone skipping prayers. For a couple of hours we waited inside the home of an uncle of one of our guides, listening to the muezzin call the locals to battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What is the need of the day?'' a man implored in Pashto over a loudspeaker. ''Holy war -- holy war is the need of the day!'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a couple of hours, we resumed our journey, traveling down a mostly empty road. And that is when it struck me: there was no evidence, anywhere, of the military operation that had made the news. There were no Pakistani soldiers, no trucks, no tanks. Nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a couple of miles, we turned off the road and headed down a sandy path toward a high-walled compound guarded by young men with guns. I had come to my destination: Takya, the home village of Haji Namdar, a Taliban commander who had taken control of a large swath of Khyber agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pulling into Namdar's compound, I felt transported back in time to the Kabul of the 1990s, when the Taliban were at their zenith. A group of men and boys -- jittery, clutching rifles and rocket-propelled grenades -- sat in the bed of a Toyota Hi-Lux, the same model of truck the Taliban used to ride to victory in Afghanistan. A flag nearly identical to that of the Afghan movement -- a pair of swords crossed against a white background -- fluttered in the heavy air. Even the name of Namdar's group, the Vice and Virtue brigade, came straight from the Taliban playbook: in the 1990s, bands of young men under the same name terrorized Afghanistan, flogging men for shaving their beards, caning women for walking alone and thrashing children for flying kites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The young fighters were chattering excitedly about a missile that had recently destroyed one of their ammunition dumps. An American missile, the kids said. ''It was a plane without a pilot,'' one of the boys explained through an interpreter. His eyes darted back and forth among his fellows. ''We saw a flash. And then the building exploded.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His description matched that of a Predator, an airborne </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that America uses to hunt militants in the tribal areas. Publicly, at least, the Predator is the only American presence the Pakistani government has so far allowed inside its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We walked into the compound's main building. In a corner, Namdar sat on the floor, wearing a traditional salwar kameez, but also a vest that looked as if it had been plucked from a three-piece suit. He stood to shake my hand, and he gave a small bow. To break the ice, I handed him a map of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and asked him to show me where we were. Namdar peered at the chart for several seconds, his eyes registering nothing. He handed it to one of his deputies. He resumed his stare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trying again, I asked about the Pakistani military operation -- the one that was supposed to be unfolding right now, chasing the Taliban from Khyber. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why, I asked Namdar, aren't the Pakistani forces coming after you? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The government cannot do anything to us, because we are fighting the holy war,'' he said. ''We are fighting the foreigners -- it is our obligation. They are killing innocent people.'' Namdar's aides, one of whom spoke fluent English, looked at him and shook their heads to make him speak more cautiously. Namdar carried on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When the Americans kill innocent people, we must take revenge,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tell me about that, I asked Namdar, and his aides again shook their heads. Finally Namdar changed his line. ''Well, we can't stop anyone from going across'' into Afghanistan, he said. ''I'm not saying we send them ourselves.'' And with that, Namdar raised his hand, declining to offer any more details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By many accounts -- on the streets, among Western analysts, even according to his own deputies -- Namdar was regularly training and dispatching young men to fight and blow themselves up in Afghanistan. An aide, Munsif Khan, told me that his group had sent ''hundreds of people'' to fight the Americans. At one point, he described for me how the Vice and Virtue brigade had recently set a minimum-age requirement for suicide bombers. ''We are opposed to children carrying out suicide bombings,'' Khan said. ''We get so many young people coming to us -- 15, 16 years old -- wanting to go on martyrdom operations. This is not the age to be a suicide bomber. Any man who wants to be a suicide bomber should be at least 20 or 25.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Khan himself, a former magazine reporter in Peshawar, had been gravely wounded in a car-bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year. His feet were mangled, and he could walk only with crutches. A bloody struggle for power rages among the many Taliban warlords of the FATA; Khan said his assailants had likely been dispatched by Baitullah Mehsud, the powerful warlord in South Waziristan, because Namdar had refused to submit to Mehsud's authority. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another of Namdar's aides had spoken enthusiastically of his commander's prowess in battle. ''He is a great fighter!'' the aide told me. ''He goes to Afghanistan every month to fight the Americans.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So here was Namdar -- Taliban chieftain, enforcer of Islamic law, usurper of the Pakistani government and trainer and facilitator of suicide bombers in Afghanistan -- sitting at home, not three miles from Peshawar, untouched by the Pakistani military operation that was supposedly unfolding around us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's going on? I asked the warlord. Why aren't they coming for you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I cannot lie to you,'' Namdar said, smiling at last. ''The army comes in, and they fire at empty buildings. It is a drama -- it is just to entertain.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Entertain whom? I asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  III. Playing the Game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The idea that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence agencies could simultaneously be aiding the Taliban and like-minded militants while taking money from the United States is not as far-fetched as it may seem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The relationship dates to the 1980s, when, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became the conduit for billions of dollars of American and Saudi money for the Afghan rebels. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader, the fundamentalist Gen. Zia ul-Haq, funneled the bulk of the cash to the most religiously extreme guerrilla leaders. After the Soviet Union withdrew in 1989, Pakistani military and intelligence services kept on supporting Islamist militants, notably in the Muslim-majority Indian state of Kashmir, where they threw their support behind a local uprising. Through time, with the Pakistanis closely involved, the Kashmiri movement was taken over by Islamist extremists and foreign fighters who moved easily between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Kashmir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, in 1994, Pakistani leaders made their most fateful move. Alarmed by the civil war that engulfed Afghanistan following the Soviet retreat, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her government intervened on behalf of a small group of former anti-Soviet fighters known for their religious fanaticism. They called themselves ''the students'': the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> providing support and the United States looking the other way, the Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996. ''We created the Taliban,'' Nasrullah Babar, the interior minister under Benazir Bhutto, told me in an interview at his home in Peshawar in 1999. ''Mrs. Bhutto had a vision: that through a peaceful Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could extend its influence into the resource-rich territories of Central Asia.'' That never happened -- the Taliban, even with Pakistani support, never completed the conquest of Afghanistan. But the training camps they ran, sometimes with the help of Pakistani intelligence officers, were beacons to Islamic militants from around the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By all accounts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spymasters were never terribly discriminating about who showed up in their training camps. In 1998, when President Bill Clinton ordered missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against camps in Afghanistan following Al Qaeda's bombings of American embassies in East Africa, several trainers from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, were killed. Osama bin Laden was supposed to be there when the missiles struck but apparently had already left. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 9/11, President George W. Bush and other senior American officials declared in the strongest terms that Pakistani leaders had to end their support for the Taliban and other Islamic militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, promised to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the game did not end; it merely changed. In the years after 9/11, Musharraf often made great shows of going after militants inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while at the same time supporting and protecting them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2002, for instance, Musharraf ordered the arrest of some 2,000 suspected militants, many of whom had trained in Pakistani-sponsored camps. And then, quietly, he released nearly all of them. Another revealing moment came in 2005, when Fazlur Rehman, the leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, one of the most radical Islamist parties, denounced Musharraf for denying the existence of jihadi groups. Everyone knows, Rehman said in a speech before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Assembly, that the government supports the holy warriors. ''We will have to openly tell the world whether we want to support jihadis or crack down on them,'' Rehman declared. ''We cannot afford to be hypocritical any more.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2006, a senior ISI official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told a New York Times reporter that he regarded Serajuddin Haqqani as one of the ISI's intelligence assets. ''We are not apologetic about this,'' the ISI official said. For a presumed ally of the United States, that was a stunning admission: Haqqani, an Afghan, is currently one of the Taliban's most senior commanders battling the Americans in eastern Afghanistan. His father, Jalaluddin, is a longtime associate of bin Laden's. The Haqqanis are believed to be overseeing operations from a hiding place in the Pakistani tribal agency of North Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But such evidence, however intriguing, fails to answer the critical questions: Exactly who in the Pakistani government is helping the militants and why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE MOST COMMON THEORY offered to explain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued contact with Islamic militants is the country's obsession with India. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fought three major wars with India, from which it split violently upon independence from Britain in 1947. To the east, the Pakistani military and intelligence services have long tolerated and sometimes directed militants moving into Indian Kashmir. To the west, Afghanistan has long been seen as a potentially critical arena of competition with India. After the U.S.-led invasion in the fall of 2001, for example, India lost no time in setting up consulates throughout Afghanistan and beginning an extensive aid program. According to Pakistani and Western officials, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officer corps remains obsessed by the prospect of Indian domination of Afghanistan should the Americans leave. The Taliban are seen as a counterweight to Indian influence. ''We are saving the Taliban for a rainy day,'' one former Pakistani official put it to me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another explanation is growing popular hatred of the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders -- whether Musharraf or the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, or the country's leading civilian politicians -- are finding it more and more difficult to mobilize their own army and intelligence services to act against the Taliban and other militants inside the country. And while the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army used to be a predominantly secular institution, increasingly it is being led by Islamist-minded officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pro-Islamist and anti-American sentiments pervading the armed forces might help explain why a group of ill-trained, underpaid Pakistani Frontier Corps soldiers would open fire on American troops fighting the Taliban. Those same sentiments buttress the notion, offered by some American and Pakistani officials, that rogue officers inside the army and ISI are supporting the militants against the wishes of their superiors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, there is the problem of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army's competence. For all the myths that officers like Musharraf have spread about the institution, the simple fact is that it isn't very good. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army has lost every war it has ever fought. And it isn't trained to battle an insurgency. Each of the half-dozen offensives the army has launched into the tribal areas since 2004 has left it bloodied and humbled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all these reasons, when it comes to the militants in their midst, it's easier for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do as little as possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a growing Islamist feeling in the military, and it's inseparable from anti-Americanism,'' I was told by a Western military officer with several years' experience in the region. ''The vast majority of Pakistani officers feel they are fighting our war. There is a lot of sympathy for the Taliban. The result is that the Pakistanis do as little as they possibly can to combat the militants.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are reasonable explanations, offered by reasonable people. But are such explanations enough? The more Pakistanis I talked to, the more I came to believe that the most reasonable explanations were not necessarily the most plausible ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ONE SWELTERING AFTERNOON in July, I ventured into the elegant home of a former Pakistani official who recently retired after several years of serving in senior government posts. We sat in his book-lined study. A servant brought us tea and biscuits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Was it the obsession with India that led the Pakistani military to support the Taliban? I asked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or is it the anti-Americanism and pro-Islamic feelings in the army? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes,'' he said, that too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then the retired Pakistani official offered another explanation -- one that he said could never be discussed in public. The reason the Pakistani security services support the Taliban, he said, is for money: after the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Pakistani military concluded that keeping the Taliban alive was the surest way to win billions of dollars in aid that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needed to survive. The military's complicated relationship with the Taliban is part of what the official called the Pakistani military's ''strategic games.'' Like other Pakistanis, this former senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of what he was telling me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dependent on the American money that these games with the Taliban generate,'' the official told me. ''The Pakistani economy would collapse without it. This is how the game works.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As an example, he cited the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army's first invasion of the tribal areas -- of South Waziristan in 2004. Called Operation Shakai, the offensive was ostensibly aimed at ridding the area of Taliban militants. From an American perspective, the operation was a total failure. The army invaded, fought and then made a deal with one of the militant commanders, Nek Mohammed. The agreement was capped by a dramatic meeting between Mohammed and Safdar Hussein, one of the most senior officers in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The corps commander was flown in on a helicopter,'' the former official said. ''They had this big ceremony, and they embraced. They called each other mujahids. '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mujahid'' is the Arabic word for ''holy warrior.'' The ceremony, in fact, was captured on videotape, and the tape has been widely distributed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The army agreed to compensate the locals for collateral damage,'' the official said. ''Where do you think that money went? It went to the Taliban. Who do you think paid the bill? The Americans. This is the way the game works. The Taliban is attacked, but it is never destroyed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a game,'' the official said, wrapping up our conversation. ''The U.S. is being taken for a ride.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IV. A New Government, A New Tack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February, nationwide elections lifted to power </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first full-fledged civilian government in nine years. The elections followed the tumultuous events of Benazir Bhutto's return from exile and her assassination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If there was any reason to hope that the government's games with the Taliban would end, this was it: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new leaders declared they had a popular mandate to steer the country in a new direction. That meant, implicitly, reining in the military and the spy agencies. At the same time, the country's new civilian leaders, led by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, made it clear that they would not be taking orders from officials in the Bush administration, whom they resented for having supported Musharraf for so long. (Musharraf, facing impeachment, finally resigned from the presidency last month.) Instead of launching military operations into the tribal areas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new leaders promised to embark on negotiations to neutralize the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The leader of this new civilian effort in the tribal areas is Owais Ahmed Ghani, governor of the North-West Frontier Province. Since February, Ghani is said to have embarked on a series of negotiations in tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I went to see Ghani earlier this summer at the governor's mansion in Peshawar, inside a lovely compound built by the British at the height of their imperial power. Ghani seemed as if he might have stepped from the Raj himself: he gave off an air of faint amusement, a British affectation common in the upper tiers of Pakistani society. On his wall hung a British-made Enfield rifle, preserved from colonial days. Outside, peacocks strolled across the manicured lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You know the joke about the Pathans,'' Ghani began, using the old British name for the Pashtuns, the ethnic group that dominates the tribal areas and the Taliban. ''A Pathan's heart hammers harder when he has a gun than a woman!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suddenly turning serious, Ghani spelled out a state-of-the-art counterinsurgency campaign to defeat the militants in control of the FATA. He emphasized that the purely military approach to the tribal areas had failed -- not merely because the army has been unable to succeed militarily but also because it no longer could count on popular support. ''No government can afford to make war on its own people for very long,'' Ghani said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new approach, Ghani said, would entail negotiations and economic development. Under the plan, the government would pour billions into the region over the next five years to build schools, roads and health clinics. (The United States has agreed to pitch in $750 million.) The political negotiations, Ghani said, would be conducted by civilian members of the government and the region's tribal leaders, not, as in the past, by military officers and Taliban militants. Ghani called this new strategy ''Jang and Jirga'' -- the Pashto words for ''war'' and ''tribal council.'' Carrot and stick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The idea is to drive a wedge between the militants and the people,'' Ghani said. ''There will be no negotiations with the militants themselves.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ghani's previous post had been as governor of Baluchistan Province, to the south, where he had weakened an ethnically based insurgency that had churned on for decades. He said he was confident he could do the same here. ''Don't underestimate the Pakistani desire to confront the militants,'' he insisted. ''Ninety percent of the country is behind us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was sundown when Ghani and I finished talking. As I strolled across the grounds of the governor's compound, a group of soldiers had just begun lowering the Pakistani flag. Another man blew into a bugle, playing ''A Hundred Pipers,'' a Scottish air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FOR GHANI AND </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">PAKISTAN'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government, the crucial players in achieving peace are traditional tribal leaders whose power is independent of the Taliban or other militants. This method of governing the tribal areas -- indirect rule through local chiefs -- dates back to the British imperial period. The British put tribal leaders -- known as maliks -- on the payroll to stand in for the central government, which imposed no taxes or customs duties and, in turn, did very little. At the same time, imperial administrators reserved for themselves extraordinary powers of arrest and punishment that extended to collective reprisals against entire tribes. The purpose of the malik system was to keep the tribal areas quiet and at least nominally under the thumb of the imperial government. This preserved a feudal political structure, and feudal levels of economic development, into the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The British system, with a little tinkering, has survived to this day: the FATA stands apart from the rest of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with little or no government presence and little or no development. Not 1 person in 5 can read or write. Pakistani political parties are banned. Universal suffrage wasn't allowed until 1997. Until recently, tribesmen could claim no protection by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Constitution or its courts. Inside the FATA, the locals do not even change the time on their clocks, as other Pakistanis do, when daylight savings begins. ''English time,'' it is called. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few days after my talk with Ghani, I met an elder of one of the two main tribes of South Waziristan. He refused to give his name and insisted that I refer to him as Jan. South Waziristan is believed to contain the largest number of militant Arabs and other foreign fighters, possibly even bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. To be more specific about Jan -- to use his name, to identify the tribe he leads, to name the town where he lives -- would almost certainly, he said, result in his death at the hands of the militants and Taliban fighters who control South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are many Arab fighters living in South Waziristan,'' Jan told me. ''Sometimes you see them in the town; you hear them speaking Arabic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But the important Arabs are not in the city,'' he continued. ''They are in the mountains.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Important Arabs? I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They ride horses, Arabian horses; we don't have horses like this in Waziristan,'' Jan said. ''The people from the town take food to the Arabs' horses in the mountains. They have seen the horses. They have seen the Arabs. These horses eat better than the common people in the town.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How do you know? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am a leader of my tribe. People come to me -- everyone comes to me. They tell me everything.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What about Osama? I asked. Is he in South Waziristan? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Osama?'' Jan said. ''I don't know. But they'' -- the Arabs in the mountains -- ''are important.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The labor it took to persuade Jan to speak to me is a measure of what has become of the area over which his family still officially presides. Since it was not possible for me to go to South Waziristan -- ''Baitullah Mehsud would cut off your head,'' the Taliban leader, Namdar, told me -- I had to persuade Jan to come to Peshawar. For several days, military checkpoints and roadblocks made it impossible for Jan to travel. Finally, after two weeks, Jan left his home at midnight in a taxi so no one would notice either him or his car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan had reason to worry. Seven members of his family -- his father, two brothers, two uncles and two cousins -- have been murdered by militants who inhabit the area. Jan said he believed his father was killed by Uzbek and Tajik gunmen who fled to South Waziristan after the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. His father had opposed them. Jan's cousins, he said, were killed by men working for Baitullah Mehsud. Jan's father was a malik, and thousands of Waziri tribesmen came to his funeral: ''the largest funeral in the history of Waziristan,'' Jan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rise of the Taliban and Al Qaeda has come at the expense of the maliks, who have been systematically murdered and marginalized in a campaign to destroy the old order. In South Waziristan, where Mehsud presides, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have killed more than 150 maliks since 2005, all but destroying the tribal system. And there are continual reminders of what happens to the survivors who do not understand this -- who, for example, attempt to talk with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government and assert their authority. In June, Mehsud's men gunned down 28 tribal leaders who had formed a ''peace committee'' in South Waziristan. Their bodies were dumped on the side of a road. ''This shows what happens when the tribal elders try to challenge Baitullah Mehsud,'' Jan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like Taliban militias in other parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mehsud's men have been strong-arming families into turning over their young sons to join. ''They have taken my own son to be a suicide bomber,'' Jan said. ''He is gone.'' The Talibs, he said, now control the disbursement of all government money that comes into the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban have not achieved this by violence alone. They have capitalized on the resentment many Pakistanis feel toward the hereditary maliks and the government they represent. Taliban leaders and their foot soldiers come mostly from the lower classes. Mehsud, the Taliban chieftain, was an unemployed man who spent his time lifting weights before he picked up a gun. Manghal Bagh, the warlord in Khyber agency whom the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military went after in June, swept public buses. ''They are illiterate people, and now they have power,'' Jan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EVERYWHERE I TRAVELED during my stay in the tribal areas and in Peshawar, I met impoverished Pakistanis who told me Robin Hood-like stories about how the Taliban had challenged the wealthy and powerful people on behalf of the little guys. Hamidullah, for instance, was an illiterate wheat farmer living in Khyber agency when, in 2002, a wealthy landowner seized his home and six acres of fields. Hamidullah and his family were forced to eke out a living from a nearby shanty. Neither the local malik nor the government agent, Hamidullah told me, would intervene on his behalf. Then came Namdar, the Taliban commander. He hauled the rich man before a Vice and Virtue council and ordered him to give back Hamidullah's home and farm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now Hamidullah is one of Namdar's loyal militiamen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are so many guys like me,'' he said, cradling a Kalashnikov. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The social revolution that has swept the tribal areas does not bode well for the plans, laid out by Governor Ghani, to oust the Taliban by boosting the tribal elders. Nor does it hold out much promise for the Americans, who have expressed hope that they could do in the FATA what they were able to do with the Sunni tribes in Iraq. There, local tribesmen rose up against, and have substantially weakened, Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, in some cases the distinction between tribe and Taliban has vanished altogether. Baitullah Mehsud, for instance, comes from the Mehsud tribe, one of the two largest clans of South Waziristan. (''The Taliban is the Mehsud tribe,'' Jan said. ''They are one and the same now.'' )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mehsud is the most powerful of dozens of Taliban chieftains who control the tribal areas. Some of them answer to Mehsud; some do not. The others are no less brutal: in July, for instance, in Bajaur tribal agency, the Taliban leader Faqir Mohammed staged a public execution of two men ''convicted'' of spying for the United States. One was shot; the other beheaded. A photograph of the men's last moments was displayed on the front page of The News, a Pakistani newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chieftains' rivalries are intense, too. Six weeks after I met Namdar, he was gunned down by one of his bodyguards, in the very house where I met him. It isn't entirely clear who ordered the killing of Namdar, but many of his followers suspect it was Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  V. The Game Changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While most of the Taliban chieftains do share a basic ideology, they appear to be divided into two distinct groups: those who send fighters into Afghanistan to fight the Americans and those who do not. And that is an important distinction for the Pakistanis, as well as for the Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the rout of the Taliban government in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, many militants fled across the border, and the Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grew. At first, they largely confined their activities to the tribal areas themselves, from where they could send fighters into Afghanistan. That started to change last year. Militants began moving out of the FATA and into the rest of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, taking control of the towns and villages in the neighboring North-West Frontier Province. Militants began attacking Pakistani police and soldiers. Inside the FATA, Mehsud was forming Tehrik-e-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an umbrella party of some 40 Taliban groups that claimed as its goal the domination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Suddenly, the Taliban was not merely a group of militants who were useful in extending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> influence into Afghanistan. They were a threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The turning point came in July last year, when the government laid siege to a mosque in Islamabad called Lal Masjid, where dozens of militants had taken shelter. The presence of the militants inside Islamabad itself, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stately, secular-minded capital, was shock enough to the country's ruling class. Then, after eight days, on orders from Musharraf, security forces stormed the mosque, sparking a battle that left 87 dead. The massacre at Lal Masjid became a rallying cry for Islamic militants across the country. Mehsud and other Islamists declared war on the government and launched a campaign of suicide bombings; there were 60 in 2007 alone. In an act of astonishing humiliation, Mehsud's men captured 300 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army soldiers that came into South Waziristan; Mehsud eventually let them go. And then, in December, a suicide bomber, possibly dispatched by Mehsud, killed Bhutto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bloody siege of Lal Masjid, Western and Pakistani officials say, finally convinced senior Pakistani military and ISI leaders that the Taliban fighters they had been nurturing for so many years had grown too strong. ''Now, the militants are autonomous,'' one retired Pakistani official told me. ''No one can control them anymore.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened an offensive into South Waziristan that was far fiercer than any that had come before. It inflicted hundreds of casualties on Mehsud's forces and caused at least 15,000 families to flee. Then, after just three weeks, the operation ended. As they had before, Pakistani commanders and Mehsud struck a deal. But this time, remarkably, the deal seemed to stick. The army dismantled its checkpoints and pulled back its troops, and the suicide bombings all but stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What happened? A draft of the peace agreement struck between the army and Mehsud may help explain. The agreement itself, which has not been officially released, provides a look into the Pakistani government's new strategy toward the militants. According to the agreement, members of the Mehsud tribe agreed to refrain from attacking the Pakistani state and from setting up a parallel government. They agreed to accept the rule of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But sending fighters into Afghanistan? About that, the agreement says nothing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that appears to be the essence of the new Pakistani game. As long as the militants refrain from attacking the state, they are free to do what they want inside the tribal areas -- and across the border in Afghanistan. While peace has largely prevailed between the government and the militants inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since earlier this year, the infiltration of Taliban fighters from the tribal areas into Afghanistan has risen sharply. Even the current Pakistani offensive, according to Maj. Gen. Jeffrey J. Schloesser, the top American commander in eastern Afghanistan, has failed to slow the influx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, the chaos has been redirected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This must have been why Namdar told me with such confidence that ''fighting the jihad'' insulated him from the Pakistani government. The real purpose of the government's Khyber operation became clear: to tame Manghal Bagh, the warlord who does not send men into Afghanistan and who was encroaching on Peshawar. Indeed, after more than a week of enduring the brunt of the army's assault, Bagh agreed to respect the Pakistani state. Namdar had been left alone by government troops all the while. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If channeling the Taliban into Afghanistan and against NATO and the Americans is indeed the new Pakistani game, then one more thing is also clear: the leaders of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army and the ISI must still be confident they can manage the militants. And it is certainly the military and ISI officers who are doing the managing -- not the country's elected leaders. When I asked Jan, the tribal elder, about the negotiations that Ghani had described for me -- talks between the country's new civilian leaders and FATA's tribal elders -- Jan laughed. ''The only negotiations are between the army and the Taliban, between the army and Baitullah Mehsud,'' he said. ''There are no government officials taking part in any negotiations. There are no tribal elders taking part. I'm a tribal elder. I think I would know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western officials agreed that the influence of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new civilian leaders over strategy in the tribal areas was close to nil. ''Until the civilians get their act together, the military will play the dominant role,'' a Western analyst in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told me. The parliamentary coalition cobbled together earlier this year is already falling apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a very close relationship,'' Jan said, describing the meetings between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army and the Taliban. ''The army and the Taliban are friends. Whenever a Taliban fighter is killed, army officers go to his funeral. They bring money to the family.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, American officials said in July that the ISI helped Jalaluddin Haqqani's fighters bomb the Indian Embassy in Kabul. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 54, including an Indian defense attache. American officials said the evidence of the ISI's involvement was overwhelming. ''It was sort of this 'aha' moment,'' one of them said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VI. The Path of Jihad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After I met Namdar, the Taliban commander, he ordered some of his young fighters to take me to the Afghan border. The mountains that ran along the border shimmered in the monsoon rains, and a new stream was running down from the peaks. It was this range, called the White Mountains, through which Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora in December 2001. The Afghan frontier, the fighters told me, was a day's walk over the hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was along a similar route, two years ago, that an 18-year-old Pakistani named Mudasar trekked into Afghanistan to blow himself up. His family, who live in the town of Shakhas in Khyber agency, told me they learned of his fate in a telephone call. ''Your son has carried out a suicide operation inside of Afghanistan,'' a man said without identifying himself. There was no corpse to send home to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, so Mudasar's family and the rest of the villagers of Shakhas gathered for a ghaibana, a funeral without a body. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is very respectable to die this way,'' Abu Omar, Mudasar's brother, told me one day at a cafe in Peshawar. Mudasar and Abu Omar were both part of the tide of young Pakistani men that has been surging across the Afghan border to fight the Americans. Abu Omar described his brother as intensely religious, without hobbies -- unlike Abu Omar himself, whose passion was playing fullback on the soccer field. ''Mudasar would lie awake at night crying for the martyred people in Afghanistan,'' Abu Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What finally drove Mudasar to want to kill Americans was a single spectacular event. In January 2006, the Americans maneuvered a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and fired a missile at a building they thought contained Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's deputy leader. The missile reportedly missed Zawahiri by a couple of hours, but it killed his son-in-law and several other senior Al Qaeda members. A number of civilians died as well, including women and children. Television footage from the scene, showing corpses lying amid the rubble, sparked protests across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My brother saw that and resolved to become a martyr,'' Abu Omar told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Confiding in only his mother and brother, Mudasar enrolled in a local camp for suicide bombers. Abu Omar declined to tell me who ran the camp or where it was, saying such things were military secrets. ''There are many such camps,'' he said and shrugged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was during our second meeting, in Peshawar's main shopping area, that Abu Omar agreed to talk about his own mission across the border. We sat in a shabby second-floor office in the Saddar bazaar. Last October, following the death of his brother, Abu Omar enrolled in one of the Taliban training camps inside Khyber agency operated by Mehsud's organization. The camp, Abu Omar said, was split into three sections: one for bomb making, one for reconnaissance and ambushes and one for firing large weapons. Abu Omar's section was given a heavy machine gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Big enough to shoot down helicopters,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Omar spoke listlessly but in great detail. The militant camp sat within a few miles of the Afghan border, he said, and only a few miles from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military base. Most of the volunteers were Pakistani, he said, although foreigners trained, too, including a Muslim convert from Great Britain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He had blond hair, but a very long beard,'' Abu Omar said, breaking into his only smile of the afternoon. ''A good Muslim.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the time finally came, Abu Omar said, he and about 20 of his comrades moved at night to a safe house near the Afghan frontier, in Mohmand tribal agency. They were just across the border from Kunar, one of the most violent of Afghanistan's provinces. There, he said, he and his comrades waited for two days until the way was clear. Then, when the signal came, they moved across. None of the men, Abu Omar said, were particularly worried about what would happen if they were spotted by Pakistani troops. ''They are Muslims,'' he told me. ''They support what we are doing.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fighting in Afghanistan, Abu Omar said, was a hit-and-miss, sometimes tedious affair: once across the border, he and the other fighters sat inside another safe house for two days, waiting for word to launch their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, Abu Omar's commander told them that there were too many American and Afghan soldiers about and that they would have to return to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second time, the mission worked. Crossing into Kunar once more, Abu Omar and the other fighters attacked a line of Afghan army check posts just inside the border. Omar put his heavy machine gun to good use, he said, and four of the posts were overrun. ''We killed seven Afghan soldiers,'' he claimed. ''Unfortunately, there were no Americans.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> successful, Abu Omar and his comrades trekked back across the Pakistani border. The sun was just rising. The fighters saw a Pakistani checkpoint and headed straight for it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They gave us some water,'' he said of the Pakistani border guards. ''And then we continued on our way.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VII. The Rose Garden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the Rose Garden of the White House, you could just make out the profile of the Pakistani prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, sitting across from President Bush inside the Oval Office. It was Gilani's first official visit and, by all accounts, not a typical one. That same day, July 28, as Gilani's plane neared the United States, a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had fired a missile into a compound in South Waziristan, killing Abu Khabab al-Masri, an Al Qaeda poison and bombing expert. The hit was a significant one, and Al Qaeda posted a eulogy to al-Masri on the Internet a couple of days later. Gilani, according to the American analyst who was briefed by officials, knew nothing of the incident when he arrived in Washington. ''They just did it,'' the analyst said. The Americans pressed Gilani, telling him that his military and security services were out of his control and that they posed a threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to American forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Rose Garden, though, appearances were kept up in grand style. Bush and Gilani strode from the Oval Office side by side. Gilani laughed as the two leaders stopped to face the assembled reporters. Over to the side, to the right of the reporters, the senior members of Bush's foreign-policy team had gathered, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her deputy, John Negroponte. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a strong ally and a vibrant democracy,'' Bush said. ''We talked about the common threat we face: extremists who are very dangerous people. We talked about the need for us to make sure that the Afghan border is secure as best as possible: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made a very strong commitment to that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Thank you,'' Gilani said, hesitating, looking at Bush. ''Now?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Please, yes, absolutely,'' the president said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gilani played his part. ''We are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe,'' Gilani said. ''There are few militants -- they are hand-picked people, militants, who are disturbing this peace,'' he concluded. ''And I assured Mr. President we'll work together for democracy and for the prosperity and peace of the world.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then the two men walked together back into the White House, with Rice and Negroponte trailing after them. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unusually strong statement criticizing the United States for sending commandos into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the chief of the Pakistani Army said Wednesday that his forces would not tolerate such incursions and would defend the country's sovereignty ''at all costs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No external force is allowed to conduct operations inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said in what amounted to a direct rebuff to the United States by the Pakistanis, who are regarded by the Bush administration as an ally in the campaign against terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When General Kayani took over as chief of the army in November,  American officials spoke highly of him and were counting on him to be their ally in much the same way, perhaps even to a greater degree, as President Pervez Musharraf had been. Mr. Musharraf was president and army chief for almost all of his nearly nine-year rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Kayani's statement on Wednesday seemed to call into question the extent of his cooperation and that of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The warning came the day after the swearing in of the new Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, and was interpreted here as a swift repudiation of Mr. Zardari, who is widely viewed as being pro-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was widespread criticism in the Pakistani press on Wednesday of Mr. Zardari's performance at his first presidential news conference, during which he refused to condemn the raid by American Special Operations forces into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas on Sept. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That raid involved commandos, based in Afghanistan, attacking a compound in South Waziristan where Taliban and Qaeda forces were believed to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American officials said it was the first of what was likely to be a stepped-up campaign by the United States against the Taliban fighters who have been using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to stage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and NATO soldiers in southern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani official with responsibility for national security said the Pakistani Army was told of the commando raid only after it happened. The official said the army was fully aware of a new American policy to inform the Pakistanis about American plans but not to seek their approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a rejection of those plans, General Kayani said, ''There is no question of any agreement or understanding with the coalition forces whereby they are allowed to conduct operations on our side of the border.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Kayani met last month with top American military commanders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, who will soon take over as head of the United States military's Central Command, on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. Alluding to that session, General Kayani said he had told the Americans of the ''complexity'' of the situation with the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another jibe at the Americans, General Kayani said public support was necessary in finding a solution. He called the commando action ''reckless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The no-nonsense tone by General Kayani brought into the open the increasing mistrust between the Americans and the Pakistanis over how to handle the Taliban and Qaeda forces in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officers have said for months that they could no longer tolerate the increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against their forces in Afghanistan by the Taliban from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They said they had concluded that the Pakistani military was unable or unwilling to deal with the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Zardari has said he understands the scourge of terrorism and wants to defeat it, most Pakistanis are opposed to American raids in their territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, General Kayani's statement made clear the tentativeness of his relations with Mr. Zardari, whose political party has traditionally had a difficult relationship with the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of getting in the middle of a divisive political battle, said General Kayani's statement amounted to an opening salvo against Mr. Zardari. The general was also responding to unease in the ranks of the Pakistani military after the session on the American carrier, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is reflecting massive internal pressure,'' the politician said of General Kayani's statement. ''He had a jarring meeting with the Yanks who told him that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are going to increase manifold. He doesn't want to take the blame for these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement is saying, 'Watch out, trouble ahead, and I am not part of it.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Describing the anger in the Pakistani Army over the American raid, a senior Pakistani official with responsibility for national security said in an interview on Wednesday that the raid was particularly ''stupid'' because it lacked a serious target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four ''foot soldiers'' in the nexus of Taliban and Qaeda forces and an estimated 16 civilians, including women and children were killed, said the official, who declined to be named because of the delicate relationship between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The political impact of the ground raid was compounded by airstrikes by American remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal area on three subsequent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, there have not been huge demonstrations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is in part, political analysts said, because the main Islamic religious party, Jamia Ulema-e-Islam, led by Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman, was no longer in the opposition but was now part of the governing coalition with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party. Further, Pakistanis are observing Ramadan, a time of few rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Pakistani elite have begun to object.  An influential figure in the North-West Frontier Province, Khalid Aziz, wrote in the newspaper The News on Wednesday that ''there is something quite bizarre about what is happening between two nations which consider themselves friends.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Aziz, who is considered pro-American, was among a select group of Pakistanis invited to meet Adm. Eric T. Olson, head of Special Operations Command, when he visited last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Aziz, a former chief secretary of the province, said it was time for the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to ''re-examine'' what had become a ''brittle alliance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, Mr. Aziz said the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal belt were counterproductive because they could end up pushing out most of the civilians and leaving the area a free zone for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the questions at Mr. Zardari's news conference dealt with the American-Pakistani relationship. ''Isn't America a terrorist, will you declare America a terrorist?'' one reporter asked the new president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari avoided answering that and most other questions directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the raid last week, the Pakistani government sent a stiff protest to the Bush administration, saying that the event was damaging to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military because it created morale problems, the Pakistani official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The message was, ''You've taken a retrograde step, and don't do this, it creates problems with our troops,'' the Pakistani official said. The raid was based on ''bad intelligence,'' he said. ''It was not a smart thing.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, there had been no response from Washington to the Pakistani protest, he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without the prior approval of the Pakistani government, according to senior American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The classified orders signal  a watershed for the Bush administration after nearly seven years of trying to work with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and after months of high-level stalemate about how to challenge the militants' increasingly secure base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say that they will notify </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when they conduct limited ground </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like the Special Operations raid last Wednesday in a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border, but that they will not ask for its permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable,'' said a senior American official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the missions. ''We have to be more assertive. Orders have been issued.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new orders reflect concern about safe havens for Al Qaeda and the Taliban inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as an American view that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lacks the will and ability to combat militants. They also illustrate lingering distrust of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies and a belief that some American operations had been compromised once Pakistanis were advised of the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Central Intelligence Agency has for several years fired missiles at militants inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from remotely piloted Predator aircraft. But the new orders for the military's Special Operations forces relax firm restrictions on conducting raids on the soil of an important ally without its permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top army officer said Wednesday that his forces would not tolerate American incursions like the one that took place last week and that the army would defend the country's sovereignty ''at all costs.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear precisely what legal authorities the United States has invoked to conduct even limited ground raids in a friendly country. A second senior American official said that the Pakistani government had privately assented to the general concept of limited ground assaults by Special Operations forces against significant militant targets, but that it did not approve each mission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official did not say which members of the government gave their approval. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any new ground operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raise the prospect of American forces being killed or captured in the restive tribal areas -- and a propaganda coup for Al Qaeda. Last week's raid also presents a major test for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new president, Asif Ali Zardari, who supports more aggressive action by his army against the militants but cannot risk being viewed as an American lap dog, as was his predecessor, Pervez Musharraf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new orders were issued after months of debate inside the Bush administration about whether to authorize a ground campaign inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The debate, first reported by The New York Times in late June, at times pitted some officials at the State Department against parts of the Pentagon that advocated aggressive action against Qaeda and Taliban targets inside the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Details about last week's commando operation have emerged that indicate the mission was more intrusive than  had previously been known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to two American officials briefed on the raid, it involved more than two dozen members of the Navy Seals  who spent several hours on the ground and killed about two dozen suspected Qaeda fighters in what now appeared to have been a planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants who had been conducting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against an American forward operating base across the border in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supported by an AC-130 gunship, the Special Operations forces were whisked away by helicopters after completing the mission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although the senior American official who provided the most detailed description of the new presidential order would discuss it only on condition of anonymity, his account was corroborated by three other senior American officials from several government agencies, all of whom made clear that they supported the more aggressive approach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government has asserted that last week's raid achieved little except killing civilians and stoking anti-Americanism in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Unilateral action by the American forces does not help the war against terror because it only enrages public opinion,'' said Husain Haqqani, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to Washington, during a speech on Friday. ''In this particular incident, nothing was gained by the action of the troops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As an alternative to American ground operations, some Pakistani officials have made clear that they prefer the C.I.A.'s Predator aircraft, operating from the skies, as a method of killing Qaeda operatives. The C.I.A. for the most part has coordinated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government before and after it has launched missiles from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Waziristan killed several Arab Qaeda operatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A new American command structure was put in place this year to better coordinate missions by the C.I.A. and members of the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command, made up of the Army's Delta Force and the Navy Seals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The move was intended to address frustration on the ground about different agencies operating under different marching orders. Under the arrangement, a senior C.I.A. official based at Bagram air base in Afghanistan was put in charge of coordinating C.I.A. and military activities in the border region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spokesmen for the White House, the Defense Department and the C.I.A. declined to comment on Wednesday about the new orders. Some senior Congressional officials have received briefings on the new authorities. A spokeswoman for Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Armed Services Committee, declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American commanders in Afghanistan have complained bitterly that militants use sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. ''I am convinced we can.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Toward that goal, Admiral Mullen said he had ordered a comprehensive military strategy to address the border region between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commando raid last week and an increasing number of recent missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are part of a more aggressive overall American campaign in the border region aimed at intensifying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the waning months of the Bush administration, with less than two months to go before November elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Department officials, as well as some within the National Security Council, have expressed concern about any Special Operations missions that could be carried out without the approval of the American ambassador in Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The months-long delay in approving ground missions created intense frustration inside the military's Special Operations community, which believed that the Bush administration was holding back as the Qaeda safe haven inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became more secure for militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stepped-up campaign inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes at a time when American-Pakistani relations have been fraying, and when anger is increasing within American intelligence agencies about ties between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, known as the ISI, and militants in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts at the C.I.A. and other American spy and security agencies believe not only that the bombing of India's embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, in July by militants was aided by ISI operatives, but also that the highest levels of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security apparatus -- including the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani -- had knowledge of the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's very difficult to imagine he was not aware,'' a senior American official said of General Kayani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intelligence agencies have said that senior Pakistani national security officials favor the use of militant groups to preserve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> influence in the region, as a hedge against India and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, some American intelligence analysts believe that ISI operatives did not mind when their role in the July bombing in Kabul became known. ''They didn't cover their tracks very well,'' a senior Defense Department official said, ''and I think the embassy bombing was the ISI drawing a line in the sand.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior American military commander in Afghanistan said Tuesday that in an effort to reduce civilian casualties, he had tightened the rules around when NATO troops here may use lethal force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commander, Gen. David D. McKiernan, also said that the military mission in Afghanistan was still short-handed by thousands of troops. General McKiernan was speaking to reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who arrived here after attending the ceremony for the change of American commanders in Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Bush has ordered that an additional Marine Corps battalion and an Army brigade combat team arrive in Afghanistan by early next year. But even then, General McKiernan said, the Afghan mission requires at least three more combat brigades. The total of additional combat and support troops needed could exceed 15,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The additional forces are required to stem violence across Afghanistan, which is up about 30 percent compared with this time last year, the general said  in an interview at his headquarters here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because of the troop shortage, he said, the military was relying more on air power; that has contributed to the rise in civilian casualties, which has outraged Afghans and brought international condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The civilian casualties have also become one of the greatest sources of tension between NATO forces and the Afghan government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hoping to reduce that toll, General McKiernan said, he issued a ''revised tactical order'' to NATO troops on Sept. 2, which emphasized putting Afghan forces out front in searches of homes and requiring multiple sources of information before attacking targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also set rules calibrating how quickly troops may increase their use of force to lethal levels, the general said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the rules were already in place, General McKiernan said, but the revised order also was meant to re-emphasize proper procedures, especially as new forces are scheduled to enter the combat zone in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The revised order was issued after an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Western Afghanistan in August, but fell short of the formal status-of-forces agreement demanded by the Afghan government in the wake of that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan government and the United Nations said that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had killed about 90 civilians. The United States military says only 5 to 7 civilians were killed, along with more than 30 insurgents. But General McKiernan has reopened the military's investigation of the episode. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For civilians and American and NATO forces, this year has been the deadliest since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which released its latest casualty figures on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It said 1,445 civilians were killed in the first eight months of this year, compared with 1,040 for the same period in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of those deaths, 800, or 55 percent, were attributed to the Taliban and other insurgent forces, twice the number from last year, as they press a campaign of intimidation aimed at civilians who support the government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a common refrain of military commanders, General McKiernan said ultimate success in the war depended on competent government and economic development. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also acknowledged that a particularly vexing problem facing the military effort was that the insurgents have found a haven across the border in tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where American commandos carried out an incursion from Afghanistan on Sept. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That incursion, along with a rising number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by unmanned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has severely strained relations between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, made a hastily arranged visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday for talks aimed at easing those tensions. Like Mr. Gates, he arrived after attending the ceremony in Baghdad where Gen. Ray Odierno took over command of American forces in Iraq from Gen. David H. Petraeus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Admiral Mullen's visit also coincided with conflicting accounts about a possible second American raid on Monday, as well as a warning by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military that it would shoot at any foreign forces that crossed the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said the Pakistani Army reserved the right to use force to defend the country and its people, but he said there was ''no change in policy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked what the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military would do if there was a future incursion by American troops, he said: ''There is a big 'if' involved. We will see to it when such a situation arises.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani governor made a televised appearance on Tuesday to insist that American forces had tried to cross the border early Monday and had been repulsed by Pakistani fire, as local residents and a Pakistani government official had said the day before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Pakistani and United States military publicly denied any such incursion, and a Pakistani intelligence official said an American helicopter had mistakenly crossed the border briefly, leading Pakistani ground forces to fire into the air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview on Pakistani television on Tuesday, the governor, Owais Ahmed Ghani of North-West Frontier Province, said that only </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''a right to conduct operations on its soil.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''will jealously guard its right,'' and that incursions will not be tolerated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani leadership, meanwhile, has warned that American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Pakistani soil threaten to undermine the country's democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This situation doesn't help democracy,'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> newly elected president, Asif Ali Zardari, was quoted as saying after meeting in London on Tuesday with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked about future cross-border raids, Mr. Zardari said, ''I don't think there will be any more.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people were killed and three were wounded when a United States Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired missiles into a house in the restive South Waziristan tribal region, local residents said Wednesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, met with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in an effort to ease tensions over an American incursion into the tribal areas and a rising number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Residents of the village of Baghar Cheena, who took the wounded to a hospital in the regional center of Wana, said  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had fired four missiles. Two hit a house, and two others landed in the mountains, they said.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred in the evening, as the villagers were breaking the Ramadan fast, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local militants immediately cordoned off the area, and retrieved and moved the bodies to an undisclosed location. Local residents said none of the wounded were from the area, but came from the Punjab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior security official confirmed the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but said that the identities of those killed were yet to be established. A Pakistani military spokesman, who identified himself as Major Murad, said an investigation was under way. An intelligence source said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place  around 7 p.m. local time, less than three miles from the Afghan border. It killed 13 militants, mostly from Punjab, and wounded at least 9, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his account, five missiles were fired, two of them hitting a compound and the rest falling in the nearby mountains. The target may have been a group of militants based in Wana who seemed poised to cross into Afghanistan for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against NATO forces, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thousands of Wazirs from the area vowed during a meeting on Wednesday to raise a volunteer army to make incursions into Afghanistan against NATO forces if the Americans again carried out a raid inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, local residents said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- War has come to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, not just as terrorist bombings, but as full-scale battles, leaving Pakistanis angry and dismayed as the dead, wounded and displaced turn up right on their doorstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 250,000 people have now fled the helicopters, jets, artillery and mortar fire of the Pakistani Army, and the assaults, intimidation and rough justice of the Taliban who have dug into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20,000 people are so desperate that they have flooded over the border from the Bajaur tribal area to seek safety in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many others are crowding around this northwest Pakistani city, where staff members from the United Nations refugee agency are present at nearly a dozen camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No reliable casualty figures are available. But the International Committee of the Red Cross flew in a special surgical team from abroad last week to work alongside Pakistani doctors and help treat the wounded in two hospitals, so urgent has the need become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is now a war zone,'' said Marco Succi, the spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forged an alliance with the United States after 9/11 has the Pakistani Army fought its own people on such a scale and at such close quarters to a major city. After years of relative passivity, the army is now engaged in heavy fighting with the militants on at least three fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden engagement of the Pakistani Army comes after months in which the United States has heaped criticism, behind the scenes and in public, on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for not doing enough to take on the militants, and increasingly took action into its own hands with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and even a raid by Special Operations forces in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the army campaign has also unfolded as the Taliban have encroached deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proper and carried out far bolder terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like the Marriott Hotel bombing on Sept. 20, which have generated fears among the political, business and diplomatic elite that the country is teetering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting on Three Fronts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early August, goaded by the American complaints and faced with a nexus of the Taliban and Al Qaeda that had become too powerful to ignore, the chief of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, opened the front in Bajaur, a Taliban and Qaeda stronghold along the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this summer, the military became locked in an uphill fight against the militants in Swat, a more settled area of North-West Frontier Province that was once a middle-class ski resort. Today it is a maelstrom of killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Swat is a place of hell,'' said Wajid Ali Khan, a minister in the provincial government who has taken refuge in Peshawar. Mr. Khan said he was so afraid that he had not been to his house in Swat for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a third front, south of Peshawar, around the town of Dera Adam Khel, the army recently recaptured from Taliban control the strategic Kohat tunnel, a road more than a mile long that carries NATO supplies from the port of Karachi to the American and coalition forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Asif Ali Zardari, spoke in New York during a visit to the United Nations General Assembly, about how the fight against terrorism was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war, not America's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as the gruesome effects of the battles slam the national consciousness, there has been scant effort to prepare the public for the impact of the fighting. Public opinion has soured on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alliance with the United States and has strongly opposed military campaigns that inflict heavy civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani law enforcement officials and residents of Bajaur and Swat say there have been many civilian deaths, but so far, no agency or government body has offered an estimate of those killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanging in the balance in the fighting is the allegiance of the civilians who have seen their homes wrecked, their cattle and crops abandoned, and their loved ones killed and wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani Army commanders have said that in order to put down the Taliban, the government must win the hearts and minds of the Bajaur tribesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Losing Hearts and Minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in interviews in the camps, and in villages around Peshawar where the displaced are bunking with relatives, many of the people of Bajaur say they are fed up with both sides of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Red Cross hospital ward, two young brothers, Haseen Ullah, 5, and Shakir Ullah, 8, lay immobile on their hospital beds, their limbs tightly bound in white bandages covering what Dr. Daniel Brechbuhler, a Red Cross surgeon, said were shrapnel wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of the two wounded boys, Hajji Sher Zaman, a relatively well-to-do used-car dealer in Bajaur, said he had no patience with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Zaman said he was furious with the government for not holding anyone responsible for the killing and wounding of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In Bajaur, innocent people are being killed as infidels, the dead cattle are lying on the road, the roads are tainted with the blood of the people who have been killed,'' he said. On return trips in recent weeks, he said, his village was ''full of the rotten smell of dead animals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Why not target the real people, the administration knows where they are,'' Mr. Zaman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another ward, Amin Baacha, 13, lay with only one arm, his right one had been amputated. An army helicopter had circled his family's pickup truck as they were fleeing their village and fired on them, the boy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Insurgent Sanctuary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a briefing at army headquarters in Rawalpindi on Monday, the military said it believed that Fakir Mohammed, the leader of the Taliban in Bajaur, had taken sanctuary in the neighboring Mohmand district. Another important commander, an Afghan Taliban, Qari Ziaur Rehman, had moved back to Afghanistan, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From their side of the fighting in Bajaur, the Taliban have mounted a brutal show of intimidation, aided by money and deep support from across the border in Afghanistan and Mohmand, according to interviews with the displaced and with law enforcement and military officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the Taliban leader, Mr. Mohammed, stormed into a gathering of tribal leaders, arriving in a convoy of 20 vehicles, said Habib-ur Rehman, a trader from Bajaur who now lives in a camp for the displaced in Timergara in the district of Dir, just outside Bajaur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mohammed, who is described by the army as one of the most skilled Taliban tacticians, told the tribesmen, ''I'm here to get you to stop the meeting. If you don't stop, you will have a coffin over your heads,' '' Mr. Rehman recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban were well financed, some of the displaced tribesmen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Koz Cinari, in Mohmand, the Taliban gathered nightly with a fleet of up to 100 double-cabin pickup trucks, according to a resident of Koz Cinari who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicles were carefully caked in mud for camouflage against possible sightings from government planes, with only a patch of clear glass in front for the driver. The convoys then crossed into Bajaur with men and weapons, the resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign languages pierced the nighttime air as the vehicles were prepared, the resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the military officials at the briefing on Monday, many of the Taliban fighters come from Central Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Swat, the Pakistani Army has been fighting the Taliban for more than two months, and still the Taliban hold the upper hand, according to accounts from people who have fled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of Taliban terrorism are widespread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, scores of Taliban fighters confronted Iqbal Ahmed Khan, the brother of Waqar Khan, a member of the provincial assembly. The fighters ordered Mr. Khan, who was with two of his sons, to choose the son he wanted killed, said the president of the Awami National Party, Senator Asfandyar Wali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Khan was humiliated into choosing one son, the Taliban killed both boys, Mr. Khan and seven servants, Mr. Wali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday a suicide bomber attacked Mr. Wali's home, killing four people and narrowly missing Mr. Wali, one of the best-known politicians in North-West Frontier Province and a national figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life in a Battle Zone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents of Swat say they are exasperated by the army-imposed round-the-clock curfew that keeps them indoors listening to the scream of jets and the thud of artillery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To increase the misery, the Taliban blew up the power grid last week, and when protesters gathered in the main street of Mingora, the police fired on them, killing six people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 140 girls schools have been destroyed by the Taliban in the last several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a typical technique to raise funds, the militants ordered the shopkeepers in the mall in the town of Matta to stop paying rent to the landlord and pay the militants instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is no light, no gas, no water, no food,'' Mr. Khan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the distress of the civilians, ''only two Taliban commanders have been killed,'' he said. ''The army has its strategy, but they don't explain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one hope in the gloom of war, said civilians and law enforcement officials, has been the formation of small private armies by tribal leaders, known in the region as lashkars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have traditionally served as a way of dealing with squabbles in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal society, but are now being formed in some cases to stand up to the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forming Tribal Armies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Salarzai, in the northern corner of Bajaur, a local private army has attracted several thousand anti-Taliban fighters, said Jalal-Uddin Khan, a tribal leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether the fervor of the tribesmen and their ancient equipment can be a match for the ideological zeal, modern weaponry and sophisticated tactics of the Taliban is an open question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other places, like Dir, just outside Bajaur, these private armies have pledged to keep both the Pakistani Army and the Taliban from entering their territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Where the army comes, the Taliban come,'' said Sher Bahadar Khan, a tribal leader from Upper Dir. His community had organized a militia and persuaded the army not to put up checkpoints. The army was of little comfort because when the Taliban killed civilians, soldiers stood by as a ''silent spectator,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to Peshawar, in the village of Shabqadar, where the Taliban have held sway for months, the local police organized civilians to join them in a display of force against the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taliban had terrorized women who did not wear the burqa, and killed men they deemed as ''pimps'' and threw their bodies in the river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief of North-West Frontier Province, Malik Naveed Khan, said he had encouraged the new police chief in Shabqadar to organize a ''popular movement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, about 500 people, led by the local police chief, marched toward a fort controlled by the Taliban in Shabqadar, Mr. Khan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 15-hour battle ensued, leaving nine Taliban fighters dead and 28 wounded, the police chief said. On the government side, one man was killed, and five wounded, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In revenge, the Taliban threatened to blow up Warsak Dam, the main water supply for Peshawar. But Mr. Khan said he was not deterred. He would not back down. ''I told the governor: 'Open many fronts. We are more than them.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: October 9, 2008, Thursday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Friday with the continuation of a front-page article about fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal regions misstated the location of a Red Cross hospital where a boy shown in the photograph had been treated for shrapnel wounds. It is in the northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> city of Peshawar -- not Bajaur, a Taliban stronghold near the Afghanistan border where the boy had been wounded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE rising violence in Afghanistan and fractious political situation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have become leading issues in the American presidential campaign and the debates between the candidates. Indeed, after seven years of war in the region, it's time to ask a very impolite set of questions: If we did, by chance, capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, would Afghanistan still matter? Would there be public support for sending more American troops to stabilize a country that has rarely in its history enjoyed strong central government and that abuts a tribal area in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that neither the British nor the Pakistanis have ever been able to control? Is the war in Afghanistan, deep down, anything more than a manhunt for a handful of individuals? And if it is, how do we define victory there? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all, Afghanistan is not the only ungovernable space with an Islamic setting around the world that can provide a base for terrorists who want to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States. The world is full of them: from Somalia to the southern Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago. Better, perhaps, not to be tied down with thousands of troops in one or two places, and instead use sophisticated, high-tech covert means to hunt down hostile groups wherever they crop up. The problem with Osama bin Laden, one could argue, was not that he had a haven in Afghanistan in the 1990s but that he was not pursued there with sufficient vigor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, here's my answer: In fact, Afghanistan is more than a manhunt, and it does matter, for reasons that have not been fully fleshed out by policy makers or the military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just because you can't pacify all the ungovernable Islamic spaces on the map doesn't mean you can't fix the one or two that are the most important, that have strategic weight over wide regions. For Afghanistan looms larger than it appears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Strategically, culturally and historically speaking, Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are inseparable. In the 16th and 17th centuries, both countries, along with northern India, were united under the Mughal Empire. Today </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with 165 million people, is a nuclearized Yugoslavia in the making, and threatens to be torn apart by the Taliban rebellion in its North-West Frontier Province (and, possibly, by the growing Baluchi and Sindhi separatist movements in its southern half). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since its birth 60 years ago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has had darkly Shakespearean politics driven by passion and vendetta in which a small cast of individuals -- Mohammad Zia ul-Haq; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter, Benazir; Nawaz Sharif; Pervez Musharraf -- have in turn executed, replaced and imprisoned one another. The only qualification of the new president, Asif Ali Zardari, is that he is Benazir Bhutto's widower. The soap opera goes on, as Mr. Sharif, a two-time former prime minister, will undoubtedly seek to undermine him by leveraging his native Punjab against Mr. Zardari's Sindhi base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is salvageable: it has an expanding urban middle class, and recent elections have by and large seen the defeat of religious extremists in favor of moderates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> future may hinge on the degree to which the United States can work with the Pakistani military to keep the Taliban rebellion from expanding not only throughout Afghanistan, but into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own cities as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paradoxically, that will mean making deals with some Taliban groups against others. For the Taliban are not a monolithic organization, but bands of ornery Pashtun backwoodsmen who have been cut out of the power base in Afghanistan by an increasingly corrupt and ineffectual government in Kabul. They are not Al Qaeda: they lack a well-defined worldview and some are susceptible to political entreaties. But if our </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not accompanied by nation-building steps like constructing roads and water wells, we will fail and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be further destabilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A failure in Afghanistan that destabilized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do India no favors. Indeed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not go quietly into history. Sindhi and Baluchi separatists talk openly of an alliance with India if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unravels. But India, while its intelligence services now and then stoke Baluchi separatism, is terrified of such a development. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  India's gravest problem -- the one that has bedeviled its rise to great power status and with which its army is obsessed -- is the fact that it shares long borders with dysfunctional states like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Bangladesh and Nepal.  The more responsible Indian nationalists see their country's expansion not in terms of hard conquest, but in terms of soft economic envelopment of its neighbors. And an American failure in Afghanistan would set in motion a string of consequences that threaten such a benign vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, victory in Afghanistan can be defined by achieving the kind of security there that existed in the 1960s, when King Zahir Shah controlled the major cities and the roads connecting them, and a relative peace reigned. Even under a weak central government, Afghanistan could finally achieve economic salvation: the construction of a web of energy pipelines that have been envisioned for years connecting Central Asia with the Indian Ocean. These might run, for example, from the natural gas fields of Turkmenistan down through Afghanistan and into the dense population zones of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India, with terminals at ports like Gwadar in Pakistani Baluchistan and Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, in Afghanistan we are not simply trying to save a country, but to give a whole region a new kind of prosperity and stability, united rather than divided by energy needs, that would be implicitly pro-American. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, a main reason the Pakistanis have been hesitant to work with us in the tribal areas is their fear that a manhunt is all we care about, rather than the region's long-term prospects. The Pakistanis take note of our burgeoning strategic partnership with India, even as they believe that India's recent opening of several consulates in Afghanistan is aimed at helping Baluchi separatists weaken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Consequently, they feel squeezed, and on the brink of being deserted by us once we track down Al Qaeda's leading figures. Afghanistan is a strategic rear base that India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are now fighting over; both countries fear chaos there and desperately want us to calm it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the Pentagon calls the ''long war'' is the defining geopolitical issue of our time, and Afghanistan is at its heart. The fate of Eurasia hangs in the balance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft hit a militant compound in South Waziristan on Sunday night, killing 20 people, including two important local Taliban commanders known for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American soldiers in Afghanistan, a senior government official and a local resident said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the dead commanders, Eida Khan, was wanted by the Americans for his cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from bases in Waziristan, the government official said. The other commander, Wahweed Ullah, worked with Arabs who were part of Al Qaeda, the local resident said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ullah, in his late 20s, was known as an ideologically committed fighter who specialized in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Americans in Afghanistan, the resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a compound in the village of Manduta, close to Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, about 20 miles from the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Khan and Mr. Ullah, as well as two brothers of Mr. Khan, were affiliated with the militant network of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a senior Taliban figure with close connections to Al Qaeda, said the official and the local resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity  of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was part of an escalating campaign by the Bush administration to hit the Taliban and their Qaeda backers at their bases in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to have been the 19th by a remotely piloted Predator aircraft in the tribal areas since the beginning of August. In the first seven months of 2008, there were five such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush administration has intensified the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after backing away from using American commandos for ground raids into the tribal belt. A ground assault on Sept. 3 produced an angry public riposte from the chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who said he would defend </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> borders ''at all costs'' against such intrusions, an unusually strong statement from one ally to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ullah, who was usually in North Waziristan, was believed to have been visiting the compound in Manduta to pay his respects to the families of those killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday on a madrasa in North Waziristan run by Mr. Haqqani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The people killed in the North Waziristan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came from the area around Manduta, in South Waziristan, the government official and the local resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Khan was well known to the Pakistani authorities. He was arrested in 2004 and jailed until last year, when he was released during an exchange of prisoners, the government official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appear to be more acceptable to the Pakistani authorities than ground incursions, government officials have complained about the intensity of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Americans' choice of targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans were concentrating on Taliban and Qaeda forces that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American and coalition troops in Afghanistan but were ignoring militants operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a senior Pakistani official in the administration that oversees the tribal region said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans are not interested in our bad guys,'' the official said. He was referring in particular to Baitullah Mehsud, a Pakistani Taliban leader, who Pakistani authorities say is responsible for planning many of the suicide bombings in the country in the last 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army is fighting the Pakistani Taliban in Bajaur, another part of the tribal region to the east of Waziristan, and that conflict appeared to be on the verge of spreading Monday after a suicide bomber rammed his car into a checkpoint operated by paramilitary forces in the Mohmand region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the first in Mohmand, an area adjacent to Bajaur. It killed nine guards at the checkpoint, the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army has said it plans to launch a campaign against the Taliban in Mohmand once it has completed its mission in Bajaur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conflict in the tribal region was discussed at a government-sponsored gathering of tribal leaders from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan in Islamabad on Monday. The meeting is part of a dialogue initiated last year by President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The emphasis at the meeting was on talks between those Taliban willing to renounce violence and the governments of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  That the gathering took place was seen as a sign that the new Pakistani government was willing to participate in a process that had been largely ignored by the former president, Pervez Musharraf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The foreign minister of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, echoing a parliamentary resolution last week that encouraged dialogue with willing militants, said, ''There is an increasing realization that the use of force alone cannot yield the desired results.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani government lodged a formal protest on Wednesday over American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the nation's tribal areas and told the American ambassador the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be ''stopped immediately,'' the Foreign Ministry said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ambassador Anne Patterson was summoned to the ministry two days after a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in South Waziristan killed 20 people, including several local Taliban commanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last Friday, a similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit a religious school in North Waziristan, killing eight people, all of them militant fighters, according to local residents. There have been at least 19 American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the militants in the tribal region since August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The escalation of the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shaken the Pakistani public, and the new government led by President Asif Ali Zardari has been under pressure to distance itself from what is perceived as an American-led fight against terrorism inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Pakistanis, including representatives of political parties in the government coalition, say they believe the increase in suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on Sept. 20, is in retaliation for the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani government has taken several steps in the last week to show its sensitivity to public hostility over the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-week, on-and-off parliamentary debate on how to tackle terrorism resulted in a broad resolution last Thursday that called for talks with militants who renounced violence. The resolution also said the Pakistani Army, which is fighting the militants in the Bajaur region of the tribal area, should withdraw as soon as possible, and be replaced by civilian law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Afghan and Pakistani leaders pledged to seek talks with Taliban forces who lay down their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the Bush administration stepped up the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Predator remotely piloted aircraft after Taliban forces in the Pakistani tribal belt conducted increasingly lethal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and coalition forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush administration has also expressed concern that Al Qaeda is using the ungoverned tribal areas to prepare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States and Europe. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Mohammed Sadiq, said Ms. Patterson was told that the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were ''counterproductive'' to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts to win the allegiance of the residents of the tribal areas and to reduce their support of the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have negative repercussions when the Pakistani government tries to get the support of the people in the tribal area,'' Mr. Sadiq said. ''They are not helping meet the objectives of the war on terror.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Ms. Patterson left the ministry, the Pakistanis said in a statement, ''It was emphasized that such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were a violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty and should be stopped immediately.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ambassador was last called to the Foreign Ministry to receive a protest after American Special Operations forces carried out a ground raid into South Waziristan on Sept. 3. The Pakistanis said the raid resulted in the deaths of civilians, including women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chief of staff of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said after the ground </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack that Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would defend its border ''at all costs.'' Since then, there has been no known ground incursion by the Americans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new position as head of the United States Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus met top Pakistani officials on Monday for the first time and heard one message wherever he turned: American airstrikes against militants in the tribal areas are unhelpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Petraeus, the former commander of American forces in Iraq, arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas had escalated. There were two separate missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday. In retaliation, a suicide bomber killed eight Pakistani paramilitary soldiers in South Waziristan on  Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the meeting with General Petraeus, President Asif Ali Zardari of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement: ''Continuing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on our territory, which result in loss of precious lives and property, are counterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically elected government. It is creating a credibility gap.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no comment or public appearance by General Petraeus, and it was not clear how he responded to the complaints. Messages left with his press aides were not immediately returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Petraeus, who has been consulting in recent weeks with a wide range of people on the efforts by the Pakistani military to quell the insurgency in the tribal areas and on the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, on Friday took over the Central Command, putting him in overall charge of the American-led military operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His visit comes as the Pentagon and the White House are completing reviews on policies toward Afghanistan, and as Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has made clear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan would be more of a foreign policy focus if he were to win the election. In an interview on CNN broadcast this past weekend, Mr. Obama said he believed it was necessary to convince </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the main threat to its security came from the militants, and not India, its historical enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his round of calls  on Monday, General Petraeus met with the commander of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the defense minister, Ahmad Mukhtar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas were generating ''anti-American sentiments'' and creating ''outrage and uproar among the people,'' Mr. Mukhtar said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani military official said the army wanted to ''bring home the point that the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are counterproductive, and that this is driving a wedge between the government and the tribal people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials have consistently complained about the airstrikes that have been aimed at Arab fighters and Pakistani militants connected to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the statements against the airstrikes have been couched in less dramatic language than General Kayani's declaration after an American ground raid in September in which he said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would defend its borders at ''all costs.'' There have been no known ground raids in the tribal areas since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a more positive note, the senior Pakistani military official, who declined to be identified  because of the sensitivity of the subject, said  the United States had started ''listening to us'' and had moved toward sealing the border between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Bajaur area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army is fighting Taliban militants in Bajaur and has criticized the United States for what it says is the failure of American troops in Afghanistan to stop Afghan militants from crossing into Bajaur and joining the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans  moved some of their forces to the east of the Kunar River last week, and this  helped curb the flow of militants into Bajaur, the Pakistani military official said. ''It is bearing positive results,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an effort to show General Petraeus the hard terrain that the Pakistani forces face against the insurgents in the tribal areas, the military planned to fly him over some of the terrain on Tuesday, the military official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That way, the general would get an idea of the long, porous border between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''We will let him see where the roads end and where the mountains start,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will be a glimpse of the Tora Bora from the other side,'' he said, referring to the area in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border from where Osama bin Laden is believed to have escaped from American troops in late 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a visit Tuesday to Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, General Petraeus planned to meet with Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, the new leader of the Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that is fighting in Bajaur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a long delay,  American and British trainers began instructing Pakistani officers last month, who in turn will train the Frontier Corps in an effort to turn the paramilitary force into a more effective group of indigenous counterinsurgency fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military officials planned to ask General Petraeus for help in increasing the army's ''operational capabilities,'' meaning equipment. But the army was reluctant to accept training. ''Why should they get into our areas?'' the senior military official asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Al Qaeda strengthens its hub in the Pakistani mountains, its leaders are building closer ties to regional militant groups in order to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Africa and Europe and on the Arabian Peninsula, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency said Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The director, Michael V. Hayden, identified North Africa and Somalia as places where Qaeda leaders were using partnerships to establish new bases. Elsewhere, Mr. Hayden said, Al Qaeda was ''strengthening'' in Yemen, and he added that veterans of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan had moved there, possibly to stage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the government of Saudi Arabia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the ''bleed out'' from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan also extended to North Africa, raising concern that the countries there could be used to stage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Europe. Mr. Hayden delivered his report in a speech to the Atlantic Council of the United States in Washington, and it offered a mixed assessment of Al Qaeda's ability to wage a global jihad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He drew a contrast between what he described as growing Islamic radicalism in places like Somalia and what he said had been the ''strategic defeat'' of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia -- the network's affiliate group in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Hayden said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas remained Al Qaeda's most significant operations base because the group's close ties to Pashtun tribes in the region gave Qaeda militants a sanctuary to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Western targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Today, virtually every major terrorist threat my agency is aware of has threads back to the tribal areas,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His remarks were the first public appraisal of Al Qaeda's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sanctuary since the C.I.A. escalated what had been a secret campaign of airstrikes in the tribal areas over the summer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Bush signed orders in July allowing the C.I.A. to broaden the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. used to focus remotely piloted Predator aircraft </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a relatively small number of Arab fighters in the tribal areas, but it has begun striking Pakistani militant leaders as well as convoys bound for Afghanistan to resupply militant fighters there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hayden pointedly refused  to give details about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted aircraft, or even to acknowledge that they occurred. He did say that the recent killing of senior Qaeda operatives had disrupted the group's planning and isolated its leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-October, a missile fired from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed Khalid Habib, the latest senior Qaeda planner to be killed this year in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''To the extent that the United States and its allies deepen that isolation, disturb the safe haven, and target terrorist leaders gathered there, we keep Al Qaeda off balance,'' Mr. Hayden said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The radicalization of Pashtun tribes, and their strengthening ties to Qaeda operatives, date in part to the decision by the Pakistani president at the time, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to raid the radical Red Mosque in Islamabad in July 2007, the C.I.A. director said. That raid, at the end of an eight-day siege of the mosque by government troops, killed scores of Pakistani militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of his remarks, Mr. Hayden deflected questions about whether he would consider remaining at the C.I.A. during the Obama administration and declined to say whether President-elect Barack Obama had asked him to extend his tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is the business of the transition team,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''This is the business of the president-elect.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indian Muslims Seek Solidarity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crowds of Indian Muslims marched through Mumbai and several other cities, denouncing terrorism and proclaiming their loyalty to the Indian state. The protests were the latest in a series of striking public gestures by Muslims, including refusing to allow the bodies of the nine militants killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be buried in Islamic cemeteries. It is part of an effort to dissociate their own grievances as a minority here from sympathy for terrorism in the wake of the deadly assault.  PAGE A6 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Efforts at Openness Are in Peril</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entered into a promising attempt at a detente when they announced an agreement to open up trade between the two countries. But the recent terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, which India blames on a Pakistani extremist group, have put the plans of increased openness on hold indefinitely, and possibly derailed them entirely.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PROSECUTOR TO MEET WITH IRAQIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American prosecutor working on the case against five Blackwater security guards -- they are charged in connection with a 2007 shooting that left at least 17 Iraqis dead -- will meet with victims' families at Iraq's National Police Headquarters in Baghdad. The prosecutor will make a presentation to the families and brief them about how the investigation has been conducted to date, what will happen during the trial and explain how they can make claims against Blackwater Worldwide.  PAGE A12  U.N. AIDE DEFENDS KARZAI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, came to the defense of Hamid Karzai, the country's embattled president, saying that his international partners risk jeopardizing their efforts to stabilize and rebuild the country unless they conduct their military operations with more care and cultural sensitivity. He also defended Mr. Karzai's recent critical remarks about his foreign allies, which diplomats from other countries called a cynical effort to curry favor with Afghan voters in the run-up to national elections.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AN EXPLORER'S EMBATTLED LEGACY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hiram Bingham's name and likeness adorn a luxury train and much of the tourist merchandise near Machu Picchu, the Incan city the explorer is credited with revealing to the outside world almost a century ago. But several events could sow doubt about Mr. Bingham's reputation: Peru has threatened legal action against Yale to recover thousands of artifacts he is accused of removing from the site, new evidence suggests that a German adventurer may have arrived there first and a legal dispute has been grinding on over who owned the site when Mr. Bingham supposedly discovered it.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Refuse to Go Away Quietly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years they worked at the Republic Windows and Door factory on Chicago's North Side, assembling vinyl windows and sliding doors. And when notified on Friday that they were being laid off, the employees voted to stage a sit-in. There are issues like notice and vacation and severance pay, they say. ''We're here, and we're not going anywhere until we get what's fair and what's ours,'' one said.   PAGE A16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BATTLING OVER VIEWS AND VISION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On one side were the off-island owners of Molokai Ranch, whose ideas for development included the building of 200 luxury homes on a gorgeous oceanfront spot called La'au Point on Molokai Island. On the other was the majority of the Molokai community, who consider the property sacred. ''We're just caretakers,'' as one put it. And so began the battle. Our Land, by Dan Barry.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">DRONE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO PATROL CANADIAN BORDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unmanned aircraft have patrolled the nation's border with Mexico since 2005, where they have helped lead to the discovery of more than 18,000 pounds of marijuana and 4,000 illegal immigrants. Now the patrols will move north, with runs along the northern edge of North Dakota using sensors that can provide video and detect heat and changes to landscape.   PAGE A22</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A CONGRESSIONAL UPSET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Few in New Orleans were betting on Anh Cao, a recent convert to the Republican Party, to beat William J. Jefferson, the once-untouchable incumbent Democratic congressman there. The day after he did just that, Mr. Cao was being approached by voters on the street with bewildered awe.   PAGE A18</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MEETING ON PRISON OVERCROWDING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A three-judge panel is meeting in San Francisco to decide whether prison overcrowding results in unconstitutional treatment of California's more than 150,000 inmates. If that is the finding, the judges could order the state to release tens of thousands of prisoners. The state says that would result in increased crime, but lawyers for the inmates said much of the reduction could come from not sending people who have committed minor parole violations back to prison.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBITUARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NINA FOCH, 84</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Dutch-born actress epitomized the cool, aloof blond sophisticate in films and on television for six decades while thriving as an acting teacher. Ms. Foch is probably best remembered by moviegoers as the socialite who tries to buy Gene Kelly's character, as well as his artwork, in  the 1951 musical, ''An American in Paris.''

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Cost-Conscious Luxury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like some other luxury brands facing plunging profits and tarnished stock, the watchmaker Bulgari is looking to become cost-conscious. But the challenge for Francesco Trapani, the chief executive, is delicate: cut too deeply, and he risks harming the brand's image of opulence and exclusivity, carefully honed over decades and reinforced by stars like Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johansson.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RIVAL PLAN FOR SUGAR LAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The board of the United States Sugar Corporation is scheduled to meet on Monday and review a proposal by the state of Florida to buy the company's land and use it to restore the Everglades. And legal questions may prevent shareholders from considering a rival plan that could prove superior for them, taxpayers and maybe for the Everglades itself.   PAGE B1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  REAL MONEY IN A VIRTUAL WORLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, a place where the deepening recession has not slowed the sale of goods: Gaia Online, a youth world with seven million monthly visitors, sells more than $1 million a month of virtual goods and expects a record month in December. This week it is adding Elvis items for the well-dressed avatar. Blue suede shoes, 50 cents.   PAGE B6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How the mighty have fallen: people with pre-cable, three-network memories may well recall when picking up a copy of TV Guide was an indispensable part of the weekly grocery store experience. In 2000, the publication was part of a $9.2 billion merger. Last week, the magazine sold for a dollar -- less than the price of a single copy.   PAGE B8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TAKING AIM AT A TV FRONT-RUNNER</SPAN></P>

Under Tim Russert, who died in June, and his temporary successor, Tom Brokaw, the program had dominated the Sunday morning talk shows. But competitors see a chance to change that. ''I think the post-Russert era begins now,'' said Chris Wallace, the host of ''Fox News Sunday.''   PAGE B8</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the auto industry selling fewer cars and holding its hand out to Congress, advertising agencies are busily downsizing their estimates of auto ad spending for 2009.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not as Easy as in Times Past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Who are the power brokers?'' Mayor John V. Lindsay asked in 1966 when he defiantly challenged their hegemony. ''They know who they are.'' But these days figuring out who the power brokers are is not so easy. This is not good for Richard Ravitch, who is trying to win support for a financial rescue plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and could use some power brokered on his behalf.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ANALYZING CASE AGAINST OFFICERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As three New York City officers prepare to face charges almost two months after a Brooklyn man accused them of beating and sodomizing him with an object, legal experts say the case against the officers hinges on two crucial elements: the extent and nature of the man's injuries, and the intent of the officers who may have caused them. An indictment against the officers is expected to be unsealed on Tuesday, people briefed on the case said.   PAGE A27 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Back Into N.F.L. Forefront</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The quarterback had the type of ligament replacement surgery generally reserved for pitchers, and the star receiver punched a teammate and received a two-game suspension. But at 9-3, the Carolina Panthers are tied for first place in the National Football Conference South and for the second-best record in the conference with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team they face Monday night. Because of the Panthers' balance, they are thought of as one of the more serious threats to the Giants when the playoffs start.   PAGE D1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A FRESH START FOR WIE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a par on the 90th hole, Michelle Wie finished tied for seventh in the L.P.G.A. Tour qualifying tournament in Daytona Beach, Fla., and earned playing privileges for 2009 with seven strokes to spare. For those who remembered the giggly, gangly Wie, who contended in women's majors while barely in her teens, the result might have carried all the impact of an unimaginative sermon delivered in a monotone. But now, at 19, she sees it as a singular moment. ''It feels like a clean slate, a new beginning, and I finally feel like I really earned it.''   PAGE D8 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Carolina, which won 16 of the first 19 N.C.A.A. titles and has won 19 over all, restored the natural order to women's soccer, beating top-seeded and undefeated Notre Dame, 2-1, in the College Cup final in Cary, N.C. Casey Nogueira, a junior forward, scored both goals. She scored the winner with 2 minutes 6 seconds remaining in regulation as North Carolina (25-1-2) rallied after falling behind.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles  needs to raise roughly $25 million to avoid being swallowed by another museum. But art lovers in Southern California need not drive into the Pacific. Rather than go begging from the usual philanthropists, the museum can rescue itself by following the route mapped out by Barack Obama's presidential campaign: seek small donations and rally grassroots organization to raise the cash. And get some rich people to donate too.  PAGE C1 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Britain goes through these sorts of convulsions every few years: an aristocrat decides to sell a piece of art that was on loan to a museum, and the art establishment and news media mount a spirited campaign for the works to be ''saved for the nation.'' Two treasured Titians that were on loan to the National Galleries of Scotland    will be auctioned if the gallery and another museum can't raise half the needed $148 million to buy them by Dec. 31.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The story was told in large block letters on the front pages of New York's newspapers. In July 2006, a grandson of the society doyenne Brooke Astor tried to usurp guardianship of her from his father, Mrs. Astor's only child. A little over a year later, the father faced an 18-count indictment regarding alleged mismanagement of Mrs. Astor's  assets. Now, the print and pages are smaller in Meryl Gordon's ''Mrs. Astor Regrets,'' her tale of a grande dame at the center of battling bluebloods. PAGE C1  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Diademes,'' an audaciously contemporary work for a viola soloist, chamber ensemble and electronic resources, was introduced in 1986, bringing widespread attention to its 24-year-old composer, Marc-Andre Dalbavie. Mr. Dalbavie, now 47 and a leading French composer, had not heard ''Diademes'' for many years before it was played on Friday at Columbia University's Miller Theater. And, as he told the audience, he was a little disconcerted by what he heard.  PAGE C3  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indo-Pak Coalition,  a trio equally grounded in folk tradition and jazz improvisation, proposes a social pact as well a musical ideal. The group's name is partly self-descriptive -- the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa is of Indian descent, while the guitarist Rez Abbasi was born in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- but it also carries an underlying message made all the more painfully relevant by events like the recent terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course it might feel naive or presumptuous for any musician to propose answers to such entrenched and complicated problems. That could be one reason politics never came up once during Indo-Pak Coalition's performance on Tuesday night at Le Poisson Rouge. As the leader and spokesman, Mr. Mahanthappa kept his tone cordial, entrusting the music to make its own case for deeper accord. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indo-Pak Coalition has a rewarding new album, ''Apti'' (Innova), featuring Mr. Mahanthappa's compositions. Here the group opened with ''IIT,'' one of several pieces involving a dartlike melody over a rhythmic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mahanthappa packed his solo with jagged yet fluent phrases, and Mr. Abbasi assumed a central role, dexterously shifting from single notes to arpeggios to full-voiced chords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mahanthappa and Mr. Abbasi both grew up in the United States, as did the group's tabla player, Dan Weiss. To a considerable extent they all approach the music of the subcontinent as self-conscious outsiders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The set's centerpiece was something called ''Looking Out, Looking In,'' and it bore DNA traces of the great Indian jazz-fusion group Shakti. But elsewhere pains were taken to avoid old hybrids. The most jazzlike harmonic sequence arrived in Mr. Mahanthappa's version of ''Vandanaa Trayee,'' by Ravi Shankar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indo-Pak Coalition isn't the only such endeavor for these musicians: Mr. Mahanthappa made one of the year's best jazz albums with a looser group called Kinsmen, and Mr. Weiss recently released an adaptation of tabla repertory for drum set. This weekend Mr. Abbasi will introduce a group he calls R.O.C. -- the letters wonkishly stand for Realities of Chromaticism -- featuring his Indo-Pak colleagues, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What distinguishes this group is its intimate scale, along with the equilateral bond of its members. Well before their closer, a fast-chattering tune called ''You Talk Too Much,'' the musicians had illustrated the sturdy elasticity of their alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rez Abbasi and R.O.C. perform on Friday and Saturday at the Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village; (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to American Power </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By David E. Sanger </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Illustrated. 498 pages. Harmony Books. $26.95. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last Sept. 2, Barack Obama went into the F.B.I. building in Chicago to get a 90-minute secret briefing from  Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, about the world Mr. Obama would face if he won the presidency. As David E. Sanger recounts in ''The Inheritance,'' Mr. McConnell warned Mr. Obama about a sickening range of intractable problems: Al Qaeda's regrouping along the ungoverned border between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, Iran's headlong progress toward getting nuclear weapons, totalitarian North Korea's expanding nuclear arsenal, Russian belligerence, an overheating planet --  and more. The sensible reaction would have been to walk outside and drop out of the race immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rarely will a president enter office so thoroughly challenged on Day 1 as Mr. Obama. This dazzling and mordantly hilarious book is a history of how we got into this particular ditch. Mr. Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, drops the strict detachment of a daily reporter and lets rip, delivering a withering indictment of his longtime subject: President George W. Bush's foreign policy, which he writes ''has left us less admired by our allies, less feared by our enemies and less capable of convincing the rest of the world that our economic and political model is worthy of emulation.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After seven years covering Mr. Bush, Mr. Sanger, a shrewd and insightful strategic thinker, is left stunned by ''the president's inexplicable resistance, until the final quarter of his term in office, to changing course.'' Mr. Bush, he says, saw strategic change and negotiation as signs of weakness. This is a Nixon who never went to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These unvarnished conclusions by Mr. Sanger will of course confirm the perfidy that Karl Rove and Bill O'Reilly presume lies in the black hearts of Times reporters. But Mr. Sanger's criticism, the product of extraordinarily diligent reporting, is too hawkish to be easily dismissed by conservatives. He believes in putting brute military power behind diplomacy, wants to win the war in Afghanistan and hates the thought of a nuclear-armed Iran and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike other accounts of Mr. Bush's foreign policy, ''The Inheritance'' is not about Iraq but about the crushing opportunity costs paid elsewhere for that quagmire. With America bogged down in Iraq, a rising China has expanded its global influence. Mr. Sanger reports of the peril from unsecured nuclear arsenals:  ''As the situation in Iraq worsened, the post-9/11 efforts to create a multilayered defense against a domestic W.M.D. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waned.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ripples from Iraq go as far as Darfur, Sudan's ravaged western region.  According to Mr. Sanger's interviews with senior administration officials, Condoleezza Rice told Mr. Bush, ''I don't think you can invade another Muslim country during this administration, even for the best of reasons.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Iraq war hobbled America's ability to threaten North Korea and Iran credibly. Mr. Sanger points out that in 2003, as North Korea kicked out international weapons inspectors and raced to complete the fuel for perhaps six nuclear weapons, the Bush administration was gunning to invade nuclear-free Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Had a few other things on our mind,'' said a senior Bush administration official, when Mr. Sanger reminded him that the North Korean crisis was unfolding at the same time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most directly, Mr. Sanger bats back at the argument made forcefully to him in 2007 by Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, that the administration never shortchanged Afghanistan because of Iraq. Mr. Sanger writes, ''Time and again, Afghanistan  --  the country where the 9/11 plot was hatched  --  was overshadowed by the war in Iraq.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commanding NATO forces in Afghanistan, called the White House in the winter of 2008 to ask for about 37,000 more American troops, he was rebuffed. According to Mr. Sanger, crucial Special Forces units, seasoned combat troops and C.I.A. personnel were shuffled over to Iraq, taking pressure off Al Qaeda and the Taliban. New Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were sent to Iraq, not Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're simply in a world of limited resources, and those resources are in Iraq,'' a senior administration official told Mr. Sanger. ''Anyone who tells you differently is blowing smoke.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sanger's book is a Woodwardian trove of inside dope. He draws upon his own interviews with Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice, Robert M. Gates, Colin L. Powell, Pervez Musharraf and many more. He offers astonishing details on how the C.I.A. penetrated A. Q. Khan's network of nuclear technology for sale and sabotaged some of Iran's efforts to get nuclear technology. And he has a terrifying chapter in which he describes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unsteady efforts to keep Islamist radicals from infiltrating or stealing from its burgeoning nuclear weapons program, bolstered with $100 million of secret American aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Inheritance'' offers up a painfully long catalog of squandered opportunities. Mr. Sanger slams Mr. Bush for not exploring the post-Sept. 11 possibilities of an alliance of convenience with Iran against Sunni Arab extremists until the end of his second term and notes that in 2005, at a potentially opportune diplomatic moment when Iran had only a few centrifuges to enrich uranium, Mr. Bush was preoccupied with Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sanger quotes Christopher R. Hill, the skillful veteran diplomat spearheading the joint American and Asian effort to denuclearize North Korea, on administration hard-liners: ''These''  --  here an epithet unprintable in The New York Times  -- ''don't know how to negotiate. Everything is Appomattox. It's just 'Come out with your hands up.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Looking forward, Mr. Sanger delivers a series of hard truths. He states bluntly that it may take decades before American troops can leave Afghanistan without risking a Taliban return to power. He reports about a July 2007 American intelligence assessment that Al Qaeda, sheltered in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, had, in Mr. Sanger's words, ''reorganized its command structure and was once again planning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States.'' Unless something big changes, he writes, Iran will get nuclear weapons, which will most likely start Egyptian and Saudi nuclear programs in response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, some of the problems that bedeviled Mr. Bush also confounded other presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Bill Clinton, who failed to stop China, Israel, India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from getting nuclear weapons. And Mr. Bush has some achievements to point to: soberly handling China, helping create the six-party talks as a promising framework for future Asian security and upgrading America's commitment to fighting the AIDS pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Bush has taken to citing Harry S. Truman, implying that history will vindicate his legacy in Iraq and beyond. ''The Inheritance'' is a devastatingly effective pre-emptive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  South Africa's Unlikely Rebel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Edwin Cameron, above, a revered high court judge, disclosed that he was H.I.V. positive in 1999, he became the first -- and remains the only -- senior officeholder anywhere in southern Africa, and perhaps in all of Africa, to announce he had H.I.V. And he used his status to challenge openly President Thabo Mbeki -- who held the power to decide whether to name him to the nation's highest tribunal -- on his ideas about AIDS.  PAGE A6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  REPORT FAULTS RUSSIA AND GEORGIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A human rights group accused both Russia and Georgia of using indiscriminate force on civilians during the brief war in Georgia in August, and said Russia had failed to prevent South Ossetian forces from carrying out ''execution-style killings, rape, abductions and countless beatings.''

The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, operated by the C.I.A., have carried out more than 30 missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since last summer against members of Al Qaeda and other terrorism suspects in the region.  Page A6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CHINA WORRIED ON TOUGHER STANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Experts in China said there were several signs that the Obama administration could take a harder line toward Beijing, including Mr. Obama's emphasis on climate change and the environment in trade negotiations and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's focus on human rights. PAGE A7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GUNMEN KILL 8 IN IRAQ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eight people were killed by gunmen in Diyala Province, northeast of Baghdad, according to provincial police officials. The killers' motives were unclear, but an official said a preliminary investigation had indicated that some of the victims might have been prostitutes.  PAGE A7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EBOLA CASE IN PHILIPPINES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the first known case of what may be transmission of the Ebola virus from a pig to a human, a pig handler in the Philippines has tested positive for a strain of the virus, world health officials and the Philippine government announced on Friday. But the strain -- Ebola Reston -- is not known to be dangerous to humans, and the worker, who was infected at least six months ago, is healthy, officials said.  PAGE A8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  KIM MEETS WITH CHINESE OFFICIAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, met a senior Chinese Communist Party official, according to Chinese and North Korean media. The meeting in Pyongyang was Mr. Kim's first public meeting with a foreign visitor since August, when he is believed to have suffered a stroke, and is thought to be an attempt to show that Mr. Kim is in control of his government.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahead of Impeachment Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, whose impeachment trial is set to begin on Monday, went on the offensive, saying that state lawmakers were trying to unseat him so they could raise income and sales taxes. He again proclaimed his innocence after being charged with, among other things,  trying to sell President Obama's former seat in the United States Senate to the highest bidder. PAGE A9 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DOWNTURN STIFLES NONPROFITS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonprofit organizations around the country have seen banks reduce their lines of credit or cut them off entirely, and states have delayed vital financing to nonprofits at a time when the need for their services is climbing sharply.  PAGE A9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Portland Journal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scandal Leaves Mayor Embattled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sam Adams, above, became the mayor of Portland, Ore., only three weeks ago, but his tenure is already in jeopardy following his admission that he had a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old male intern when he was a city commissioner. Mr. Adams, who is the city's first openly gay mayor, is facing a state investigation, and the local police union has asked him to resign.  PAGE A9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6 CHARGED IN MONEY FRAUD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Six people, all from the New Orleans area, accused of fraudulently obtaining more than $700,000 from Louisiana's Hurricane Katrina homeowner grant program were charged in federal court.  Page A10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  REPEALING ABORTION RESTRICTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama repealed rules on Friday that restricted federal money for international organizations that promote or provide abortions overseas, sweeping aside a crucial pillar of the social policy architecture of George W. Bush's presidency.  PAGE A11</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EFFORTS AGAINST EVOLUTION DEFEATED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An effort by conservative members of the Texas State Board of Education to undermine the teaching of evolution was defeated after the board voted to drop a mandate that science teachers explore the ''strengths and weaknesses'' of theories. But the conservative faction managed to pass amendments that critics say could open the door to teaching objections to evolution.  PAGE A12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  HOPING SHIP KEEPS TOWN AFLOAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Rhode Island struggles with one of the nation's highest unemployment rates, officials in Newport,  and elsewhere in the state hope that turning a giant steel hull in the city's harbor into a tall ship will create jobs, attract tourists and spur interest in the state's maritime history.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Engine Under Water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After US Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River last week, its left engine settled on the bottom. The team trying to recover the engine for evidence was aided by a project undertaken by scientists in recent years, in which they used sonar to scan and map every square foot of the Hudson River more than six feet deep. PAGE A13 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PUSHING FOR HUMANE TREATMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  James P. Cullen left Sunnyside, Queens, in 1969, after driving tractor-trailers to put himself through the School of Law at St. John's  University. He climbed the Army ranks, becoming a brigadier general before retiring and becoming an advocate for the use of humane procedures in the detention of suspected terrorists. When President Obama signed executive orders that declared that the United States would not use torture in pursuit of intelligence, Gen. Cullen was there with him. Jim Dwyer, About New York.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT THE FIRST DRAFT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of Bailout Got Right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The aim of the original legislation for the Troubled Asset Relief Program was to get bad assets off the books of troubled banks, and there's near unanimity among lawmakers that such a plan is the best way to help resolve the banking crisis. So how do we go about it? Joe Nocera, Talking Business. PAGE B1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  G.E.'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Electric had an up-and-down fourth quarter, with profits down 43 percent from last  year. That's caused analysts to wonder how long G.E., the largest nonbank company in the United States, can continue paying out its generous dividends and maintain its stellar credit rating.  PAGE B3 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TEMPTED TO SKIRT THE NANNY TAX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Timothy F. Geithner's nomination for Treasury secretary hit a snag relating to a housekeeper, it struck fear in hundreds of thousands of people who are also breaking the law by not disclosing household employees on their tax returns. So why not simply file them? Because the paperwork is a headache and the chances of getting caught are slim. Ron Lieber, Your Money.  PAGE B1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MORE DISCLOSURE FOR DEVICE MAKERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The medical device industry has been buffeted by bad publicity in the wake of federal investigations over undisclosed financial ties between companies and physicians. Senators reintroduced legislation that would require greater transparency of financial links between doctors and device companies, and one firm has gone as far to bar its salespeople from lobbying doctors outside of ''business hours'' at a major industry convention.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More Woes for Britain and Spain  B2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IT'S NOT TV, IT'S UH, DIRECTV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last fall, DirecTV began broadcasting first-run episodes of ''Friday Night Lights,'' which recently began their network run  on NBC. That was the beginning of a repositioning for the satellite television provider, which is trying to transform one of its channels into an HBO-like network that would run television series that previously ran on premium cable networks.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Europe Isn't Rosier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, Brandon Jennings was regarded as the best high school point guard prospect in the nation, but he made an unprecedented move when he passed up college basketball to play professionally in Italy. But life overseas hasn't been what he expected. His playing time has been sporadic. He is rarely paid on time. Now, instead of being the pioneer for an alternate route to professional basketball, he is warning others against it.  PAGE D3 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CARRYING A CHILD AND A LEAGUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Candace Parker, the star forward for the Los Angeles Sparks, is expecting her first child in the spring, but she still wants to play when the W.N.B.A. starts in June. And while there are other mothers in the league, none of them are expected to carry women's basketball like Parker, the face of the league's marketing campaign.  PAGE D1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NAGGING QUESTION FOR U.S. SOCCER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has been trying to find someone to play left back in international soccer competition for more than 10 years. As the 2010 World Cup draws ever closer, the hole has still not been filled.  PAGE D6 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ETHNIC CLASH AT TENNIS MATCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though an Australian Open match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Amer Delic, a Bosnian-born American, was mostly civil, their fans taunted one another, and clashed afterward. The police arrested two men and ejected 30 people from Melbourne Park after the rival supporters traded punches and kicks and a woman was injured by a chair thrown in the melee. PAGE D5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BUILDING BIG MEN FOR THE STEELERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Mitchell, above, the Steelers' defensive line coach, was the first African-American to play football at the University of Alabama, though he plays down his role as a hero of the civil rights era. ''He had to be pretty strong just to walk in not knowing what was going to happen when he got there,'' said a former college teammate.  PAGE D5 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BILL WERBER, 100</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was the leadoff hitter in the first major league baseball game ever televised and was the oldest former big leaguer. He played with the Yankees' storied Murderers' Row team of 1927, which included Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.  PAGE A14</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  China Gets Home-Grown Rap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite its growing popularity among the country's urban youth, Chinese hip-hop is not sanctioned by broadcast media producers or state censors but it has managed to attract a grassroots fan base. Since the group Yin Ts'ang, one of the pioneers of Chinese rap, dropped ''In Beijing'' in 2003, the hip-hop scene in China has quickly grown.   PAGE C1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DELVING INTO THE REALM OF LUST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel Bergner's new book ''The Other Side of Desire: Four Journeys into the Far Realms of Lust and Longing,'' is about people whom most of us would call perverts or weirdos. With main characters including a man with a foot fetish, a woman who runs an S&amp;M dungeon and a man with a fixation on his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Mr. Berg ner digs for how people come to have the sexual desires that they do.

Edward Rothstein calls it a chronicle of chronicles on how information in 16th-  and 17th-century England gradually made its way from private journals to publicly sold broadsheets and pamphlets.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WOMEN'S HEALTH, UNGAGGED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama began dismantling his predecessor's broad and damaging assault on women's reproductive health and freedom. He lifted the odious gag, which bars any health care provider receiving American family-planning aid  from counseling women on abortion, engaging in political speech on abortion or providing abortions, even with its own money.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched from remotely piloted American aircraft killed at least 15 people in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that the use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill militants within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> borders would continue under President Obama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remotely piloted Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the Central Intelligence Agency have carried out more than 30 missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since last summer against members of Al Qaeda and other terrorism suspects deep in their redoubts on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have also killed civilians, enraging Pakistanis and making it harder for the country's shaky government to win support for its own military operations against Taliban guerrillas in the country's lawless border region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials in Washington said there were no immediate signs that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday had killed any senior Qaeda leaders. They said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had dispelled for the moment any notion that Mr. Obama would rein in the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama and his top national security aides are likely in the coming days to review other counterterrorism measures put in place by the Bush administration, American officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These include orders President Bush secretly approved in July that for the first time allowed American Special Operations forces to carry out ground raids in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without the approval of the Pakistani government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Friday's missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit Waziristan, a remote and mountainous region controlled by the Taliban, in the semiautonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first struck a village known as Mir Ali in North Waziristan late in the afternoon. In a statement, Pakistani government officials said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> destroyed the house of a man identified as Khalil Dawar and killed eight people. The statement said militants had surrounded the area and retrieved the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani security official said four of those killed were Arabs. Pakistani intelligence officials often take the presence of foreign fighters as an indication of Qaeda involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missiles struck a house near the village of Wana in South Waziristan, killing seven people, according to local accounts and Pakistani news reports. The reports said three of the dead were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials believe that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed a number of suspected militants along the frontier since last year, including a senior Qaeda operative who was killed Jan. 1 and was suspected in the 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad four months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the civilian toll has angered Pakistanis. A senior Pakistani official estimated that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might have killed as many as 100 civilians; it was not possible to verify the estimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials are known to share some intelligence about militants, but it is unclear whether Pakistani officials have in any way acquiesced to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or helped provide intelligence for them while opposing them in public. Openly supporting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be untenable for a government perceived as being too close to the American government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the envoy Richard C. Holbrooke arrives here Monday looking for ways to stop a runaway Islamist insurgency that is destabilizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he will find a pro-American but weak civilian government, and a powerful army unaccustomed and averse to  fighting a domestic enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a nuclear-armed nation regarded as an ally of the United States and considered pivotal by the Obama administration to ending the war in neighboring Afghanistan, Mr. Holbrooke  will face a surge of anti-American sentiment on clear display by private citizens, public officials and increasingly potent television talk shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some remedies offered by his hosts are likely to be unappealing. On almost every front, Pakistani leaders are calling for less American involvement, or at least the appearance of it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The main reason for the swell in resentment here is the very strategy that the United States government considers its prime success against Al Qaeda: missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delivered by remotely piloted aircraft against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the surprise of many Pakistanis, who had been promised by  their leaders that the new administration in Washington would be different, American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft fired missiles at two areas in the tribal belt just three days after President Obama's inauguration. According to the Pakistanis, as many as 21 civilians were killed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North and South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fury at the continued airstrikes is considered  one of the reasons for the poor showing of President Asif Ali Zardari in public opinion surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Pakistanis view Mr. Zardari  as too close to his American patrons. He is widely believed to have agreed to a request from President Bush for a widening of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which had been conducted far more sparingly before Mr. Zardari  came to power last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an effort on Saturday to assuage an angry public, Mr. Zardari told an audience in Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, that he would argue against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during Mr. Holbrooke's visit. According to the Pakistani state press agency, Mr. Zardari said that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were ''counterproductive'' and that the ''day was not far away when these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be stopped.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari's sudden appearance in Peshawar, a city virtually under siege from the Taliban, just two days before Mr. Holbrooke's arrival  was his first  there since he became president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was reported to have said that the visit by Mr. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, would give him the opportunity to educate the  administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will tell them fighting was no solution to the imbroglio,'' Mr. Zardari was quoted as having said, ''and let us handle it in our own way, as we know better than them as to how best the issue could be tackled.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said they agreed with the American assessment that the airstrikes had killed some of the senior leadership of Al Qaeda. But the civilian casualties that have accompanied the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have accelerated anti-American feelings and made the Pakistani military appear feeble, they said. They argued that short-term tactical gains were likely to be outstripped by long-term strategic losses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even when the real militants get killed, there is also a high probability that unarmed civilians get killed,'' said Farhatullah Babar, the spokesman for Mr. Zardari. ''People get galvanized and become sympathetic to the militants.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The best alternative, Mr. Babar and former and current military officials said, was for the Americans to share intelligence with the Pakistanis, and for the Pakistanis to carry out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks. If Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conducted the air raids, they said, the militants could not contend that the battle against them was ''America's war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the very least, the Pakistanis say, they will drive home to Mr. Holbrooke the need for American military aid to help fight the insurgents -- in particular, helicopters and  night-vision gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a startling example of its shortcomings in counterterrorism, the Pakistani Army has been unable to thwart the FM radio signal of the leading Islamic militant in the Swat Valley, an area just 100 miles from this capital city. There, an army division of about 12,000 men has lost ground to the roughly 3,000 Taliban. The radio programs of the militant leader, Maulana Fazlullah, have proved a virulent weapon, forcing landowners to flee, terrorizing the police and spreading hatred of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the army, Gen. Athar Abbas, said the militant's radio broadcasts were difficult to track because they ''shifted from one place to another.'' The army is trying to get the technology to jam the transmissions but has  been unable to do so, he said. In a recent briefing of Pakistani journalists, the army said it had acquired a strong transmitter from China but had not yet installed it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those kinds of failures, and the fact that none of the top leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed, have prompted sharp criticism of the army from politicians aligned with Mr. Zardari. In a televised interview, one such politician, Hasham Baber, a member of the Awami National Party -- which controls the North-West Frontier Province -- accused the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency and the army of being allies of the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if the United States increases military assistance for fighting the insurgency, it will be difficult to coax a better counterterrorism performance from the Pakistani Army, in part because of its deep suspicion about the United States' intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama said last week that a central goal would be to prevent nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from destabilizing Afghanistan. By that, he is widely understood to have meant that the jihadists who use the tribal area as a base to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American troops in Afghanistan, and to sweep down elsewhere in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, must be conquered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Pakistani strategic planners, however, interpret Mr. Obama's plan to send more troops to Afghanistan as a direct threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and in particular to its nuclear arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The belief, according to a senior Pakistani military officer, is that additional forces in Afghanistan would spill over into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''Afghanistan is irrelevant,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''The American troops are designed to create a mess in the tribal areas and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and take the nukes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another major irritant in the bilateral relationship that could hamper cooperation from the Pakistani military stems from the decision by the Bush administration to complete a nuclear deal with India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archenemy. The deal permits civilian nuclear trade between India and the United States, even though India has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This enhanced relationship was interpreted as a serious snub to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Maleeha Lodhi, who served twice as Pakistani ambassador to the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Indo-U.S. deal,'' she said, ''signified to the Pakistani military that while Washington saw its ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in tactical terms, the strategic relationship was forged with India.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To overcome qualms in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the United States, Mr. Holbrooke is likely to emphasize Washington's plans for a drastic increase in aid to the country's educational, health and judicial systems, all areas that the United States has   supported in the past, but to little effect because of deep corruption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In line with legislation for the assistance written by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he was in the Senate, Mr. Holbrooke will insist that the flow of aid depends on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determination to act against terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistanis see that condition, too, as demeaning. ''An approach that treats </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the paradigm of 'hired help,' rather than valued ally,'' Ms. Lodhi wrote in a Pakistani daily paper, The News, ''should be unacceptable to Islamabad.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, wound down his whistle-stop tour of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday with a brief visit to the lawless tribal areas, and then dinner with liberal intellectuals at a rooftop restaurant here in Lahore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had come to listen, not to lecture, Mr. Holbrooke said. What he heard was a familiar list of requests for more money and arms from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top leadership, as well as a litany of complaints about American airstrikes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas using Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke's trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and his four-day tour of Afghanistan, which is scheduled to begin Thursday, are  part of a top-to-bottom review of American policy in the region ordered by President Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The challenge for the new administration is how to persuade a Pakistani military fixated on its archenemy India to reorient its troops to fight the insurgency of Al Qaeda and the Taliban  that is engulfing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington also wants to convince the poorly organized and almost bankrupt civilian government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, that it must support the military in its counterinsurgency efforts by providing proper governance and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of his tour in the capital, Islamabad, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Zardari; the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani; and the head of Inter-Services Intelligence, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials familiar with the conversations say Mr. Holbrooke was faced with universal opposition to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which American officials say have helped disrupt the Qaeda network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistanis insist that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed civilians, have further turned public feeling against the United States, and represent an infringement of their sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What, if anything, the Obama administration plans to do about the protests over the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not clear, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A retired Pakistani general, Talat Masood, who attended a dinner in honor of Mr. Holbrooke at the American Embassy on Tuesday night, said he got the impression that there may be some effort by the Americans to make the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more palatable by conducting them as a joint operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''counterproductive'' and said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States would form a joint team of officials to review policy differences, including the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As well as voice opposition to the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Kayani asked for more equipment for the army's counterinsurgency efforts, which the Pakistanis have long asserted they have been denied by Washington. ''We are crying hoarsely,'' General Kayani's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said of the request that was made to Mr. Holbrooke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari, who is presiding over a crumbling economy on life support from the International Monetary Fund, made a major pitch for immediate American economic assistance, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday morning, Mr. Holbrooke flew in a helicopter over the mountainous border between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where supplies for American and NATO troops in Afghanistan have come under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from militants in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was then flown over the Bajaur and Mohmand areas of the tribal belt, where the Pakistani Army is fighting the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He landed at Ghalanai, the small town that serves as the capital of Mohmand, and heard from the government's chief representative, Amjad Ali Khan, how the civilian authorities were using the persuasion of local tribes to bring young men who had joined the Taliban back into the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the government was showing Mr. Holbrooke its best efforts against the insurgents, a car bomb killed a popular provincial legislator in Peshawar, the chaotic capital of the North-West Frontier Province. The politician, Alam Zeb Khan, was driving to inspect a development project in the city, his supporters said, when a remote-controlled bomb blew up his car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a sense of how the insurgency is affecting people, Mr. Holbrooke met in Peshawar with a group of women from nongovernment organizations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A young woman who lived in Swat, an area where the army has virtually lost control to the Taliban, told Mr. Holbrooke how the Taliban had killed her husband. The women of Swat, she told him, were confined to their houses, were not allowed to go shopping, and lived in fear of the Taliban, who spread their message through FM radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though Mr. Holbrooke was accompanied by the deputy commander of the United States Central Command, Maj. General John R. Allen, the high-profile visit by a civilian envoy could change the tone of the conversation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Ahmed Rashid, the author of a recent book on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, called ''Descent into Chaos,'' who attended the dinner with Mr. Holbrooke in the old town in Lahore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a complete sea change in what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is used to,'' said Mr. Rashid, who was invited to Washington just before the inauguration to attend a small foreign policy dinner with Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a suspicion in the American establishment that the Pakistani Army has found it easier to pull the wool over the eyes of the American military. It will be harder to do that with the civilians.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, before leaving for Afghanistan, Mr. Holbrooke is scheduled to meet Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N who served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharif holds some sympathies with the Islamic parties, and, as a rival of Mr. Zardari's, he is considered an important figure for the Americans because he would like to maneuver his way to power in the coming year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one in three cases of stalking is reported, according to a Justice Department study. Even when such cases reach court, they are difficult to compile because there is often no clear physical evidence linking a stalker to the victim. PAGE 22</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia's budget just got a lot more cooks. Residents have their first chance to present ideas for the budget before it is presented to the City Council on March 19. The direness of the city's finances prompted Mayor Michael A. Nutter to arrange public workshops in an effort to win support for what he says will be painful spending cuts or tax increases, or both. PAGE 26</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Las Vegas has long been one of the standard destinations for conventions, but the city's anything-goes image is not jibing with the new era of fiscal restraint, and a rash of conference cancellations has unnerved local politicians and resort executives.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, proponents of Indian Point, the nuclear plant 35 miles north of New York City, talked of jobs and energy, and critics talked of safety and the environment. So, with fear of the pink slip running rampant, the decision to be made next year on whether to relicense the plant for 20 more years feels like something close to a foregone conclusion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Two missiles fired from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft killed more than 30 people, including Qaeda and Taliban fighters, near the Pakistani border with Afghanistan on Saturday, according to a Pakistani intelligence official and residents of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missiles struck three compounds, including one where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, and foreign and local fighters loyal to him sometimes gather, the official and residents said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehsud, one of the most feared leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas, was not among those killed, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehsud, a Pakistani, has fought the government openly in the past, and government and intelligence officials say forces loyal to him continue to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pakistani troops in the Swat Valley and the Bajaur and Mohmand tribal areas. The previous government, led by Pervez Musharraf, accused Mr. Mehsud in the killing of Benazir Bhutto, a former Pakistani prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Mehsud was the target of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in South Waziristan, it would be the first time that American missiles were aimed at him, the intelligence official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency have generally been aimed at foreign Qaeda fighters and Taliban guerrillas from Afghanistan, who take shelter in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> between raids into their country to fight American and NATO soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A C.I.A. spokesman, Mark Mansfield, declined to comment on the reports of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday, as is the agency's standing policy. A spokesman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arab and Uzbek fighters were among those killed Saturday, according to the intelligence official and residents of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week by Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, that was part of a review of American policy in the region ordered by President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his visit, Mr. Holbrooke heard a litany of complaints about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> some of which have inadvertently killed civilians, making it harder for the country's shaky government to win support for its own military operations against the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear if any civilians where killed in Saturday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which residents say also hit a madrasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also comes after a statement on Thursday by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the aircraft take off from a base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As I understand it, these are flown out of a Pakistani base,'' Ms. Feinstein said during a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially in the last six months, have increased anti-American sentiment in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to very high levels, and Ms. Feinstein's statement is likely to further inflame the protests over them. Her statement was prominently covered by the Pakistani press on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many Pakistanis have accused their government of giving quiet approval for the United States to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas, they also assumed that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out more than 30 missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda and Taliban targets in the tribal areas, according to a report by the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington. Two missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just days after Mr. Obama was inaugurated indicated that his administration, at least for now, planned to continue the policy of the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compounds that were hit Saturday were in the village of Shwangai, near the town of Makeen. The village is about 60 miles from the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of the area said that bodies were still being recovered from the debris hours after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the fourth in the area controlled by Mr. Mehsud, but none of the others were believed to have had him as a target. Most of these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have occurred since September, when President Asif Ali Zardari took power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE MONTHS AFTER 9/11, American forces in Afghanistan bombed the Taliban and, in vain, hunted for Osama bin Laden, while in Washington counterterrorism experts worried about ''the next Afghanistan,'' a safe haven where terrorists would train, test their weapons and organize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States. These discussions produced a double-barreled national-security strategy that dominated President George W. Bush's tenure. The first element of the strategy was to identify and eliminate terrorist networks that already existed. The second was to prevent new networks from flourishing by promoting open, democratic societies that, the thinking went, would be less susceptible to Al Qaeda's message than closed ones. Hard and soft power would be brought to bear on all the potential Afghanistans, while Afghanistan itself would be kept from regressing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The list of candidates for the next Afghanistan was long. Just about every Muslim-majority country, or even those with sizable Muslim minorities, was considered suspect. Intelligence analysts fixed their attention on remote islands and jungles in the Philippines and Indonesia and on the rugged mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. Africa emerged as one of the greatest areas of concern, and the Sahel, a scrubby band of ungoverned terrain straddling Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa, proved especially troublesome. An Islamist government in Sudan was host to bin Laden for five years during the 1990s. In Algeria, an Islamist insurgency ultimately commanded by the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, better known by its French acronym, G.S.P.C., was entering its second bloody decade. And in Mauritania only 3.5 million people occupied an area the size of Texas and New Mexico combined, making it -- despite decades of oppressive military rule -- one of the least-controlled parts of the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Sahel soon became a laboratory for the United States to test its policies in the ''global war on terror.'' In 2002, the State Department started the Pan-Sahel Initiative, a counterterrorism program that involved working with local militaries in Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania. In 2005, the program, in partnership with the United States Agency for International Development and the Pentagon, expanded under a new name to Nigeria, Senegal, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Special Forces operatives remain in some of the countries year-round to train local armies at battling insurgencies and rebellions and to prevent bin Laden and his allies from expanding into the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Things haven't quite gone according to plan. Rebels still threaten to overrun the capital of Chad, and in Sudan the violence in Darfur became worse. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda established sanctuaries in the Sahel, and in 2006 it acquired a North African franchise. Terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region increased in both number and lethality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost since the war on terror began, the Bush administration has been criticized for lecturing the Iraqis and the Iranians about democracy while supporting authoritarian regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite an avowed national-security strategy that prized both democratic values and killing terrorists, the emphasis almost always fell on the latter. But in some places at least, the administration's approach to counterterrorism has undergone significant changes. As the terrorist threat appeared to change its nature, certain administration policy makers responded with a level of nuance rarely associated with George W. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nowhere was this shift more evident than in Mauritania, where, last summer, a military coup toppled a democratically elected government. The generals justified the coup on security grounds. The United States responded by suspending its military aid even as the junta highlighted the threat it faced from Al Qaeda. A month after the coup, militants claiming to be associated with Al Qaeda ambushed a military convoy in northern Mauritania and killed 12 soldiers. Was the United States putting its commitment to democracy ahead of its commitment to fighting terrorists? Or was the war on terror changing, with the United States no longer seeing every jihadist franchise as an existential threat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   I. The Democracy Agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have always thought that democracy was our best antiterror weapon,'' Mark Boulware, the American ambassador to Mauritania, told me when I met him in Washington last fall. Boulware arrived in Mauritania at an opportune time. In April 2007, Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi became president after the country's first transparent election. Cooperation with the United States on security issues immediately resumed, ending a two-year hiatus that followed a coup in 2005. With Abdallahi's presidency, the Bush administration's two dominant priorities, fighting terrorism and promoting democracy, appeared to dovetail perfectly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte flew to Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, for Abdallahi's inauguration ceremony. Months later, Bush invited Abdallahi to an intimate discussion among emerging democracies during the United NationsGeneral Assembly meeting. Washington welcomed Mauritania into its Threshold Program, an anteroom to full membership in the Millennium Challenge Account -- the flagship of the Bush administration's approach to development aid, where funds became available only after countries achieved a certain score on a range of good-government indexes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The democratic movement in Mauritania did not last long. Last August, Abdallahi's generals overthrew him after he tried to fire them. The American partnership with Mauritania promptly collapsed. A high-tech American surveillance plane, which had been based in Mauritania to fly over the northern part of the country, searching for Al Qaeda training camps, was removed, as were the 80 or so Army and Marine Special Forces troops that were training a counterterrorism unit. The Threshold Program funds dried up, and Mauritania's chances for membership in the Millennium Challenge Account disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were using Mauritania as an example of how countries should move forward with elections,'' Dell Dailey, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, told me. Dailey served more than three decades in the army's shadowy world of Special Operations, eventually leading such operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the State Department in the summer of 2007. Dailey said the American message was simple: ''When you hold elections, there are certain benefits, like assistance in security and law enforcement and economic development. The three pillars of trying to defeat terrorism and build a good society are development, good governance and security. In Mauritania, they were moving in that direction. The coup was extremely disappointing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The junta tried to convince the world otherwise, claiming that Abdallahi had been weak on terrorism. The new leaders said that, by legalizing an Islamist party and meeting with moderate Islamists to request help in challenging the growing militant Salafist movement in the country, Abdallahi paved the way for a string of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mauritania over the past two years. The military's charges were ignored by Washington, however. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To this day, Washington considers Abdallahi the legitimate president of Mauritania. Two capitals coexist: one in Nouakchott, where Gen. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz occupies the presidential palace; and one in Abdallahi's hometown, Lemden, where he lives in internal exile. (On the anniversary of Mauritania's independence day, Bush sent Abdallahi a congratulatory letter there.) Even the vocabularies used in the two capitals are different: Abdallahi and his supporters slip the words ''democracy'' and ''election'' into every sentence, while the junta talks about ''terrorism'' and ''Al Qaeda'' at every turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, the junta waits for President Barack Obama to give the country a fresh look. ''We hope that your new president, a young man with the interests of Africa in mind, will be more understanding of our situation,'' Mohamed Ould Moine, the minister of communication, told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II. The Franchise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When not pushing democracy, the Bush administration focused on finding and killing terrorists. Missiles from Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were fired at militants in Iraq, Afghanistan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia and Yemen. In the Sahel, counterterrorism officials faced people like Sidi Ould Sidna, a young Mauritanian who had a strange career as a foot soldier in an Al Qaeda affiliate. Sidna's story demonstrates both how America's jihadist adversaries have become more complicated than the Bush administration first envisioned and how, in the end, some figures on the administration's counterterrorism team fashioned an unexpected response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late last year, I spoke to a number of sources in Mauritania and the United States, both inside and outside of government, about counterterrorism operations in the region and the activities of Al Qaeda associates there like Sidna. Many could not identify themselves in print because of the nature of their work, but from these interviews I was able to piece together a picture of jihadism in this part of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sidna grew up in a poor neighborhood of Nouakchott called Toujanine. When I went there one evening in December, I found kids playing soccer at dusk in a wide dirt road. Goats rummaged through trash that filled a ditch about five feet from the front door of Sidna's home. According to friends, neighbors and relatives, Sidna had a reputation as a scrappy kid. ''Sidi wasn't a thief, because thieves rob you and run,'' one childhood friend told me. ''Sidi took your watch or your T-shirt right in front of you.'' By his midteens, Sidna was smoking hashish, drinking wine and hanging out with an older crowd. He liked to dance and earned the nickname Lambada. Besides robbing people, he also stole cars. Friends and law-enforcement authorities claim that he was involved in multiple rapes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his conscience apparently caught up with him by his late teens. He joined a friend at a mahadra -- an Islamic seminary -- outside Nouakchott. He spent several months there and, like many restless young men in the region, grew fond of listening to jihadist audio recordings, particularly those of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Iraq's Al Qaeda franchise, that circulated around the mahadra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why Zarqawi?'' I asked the friend who took Sidna to the mahadra. ''What made his sermons appealing?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everyone in the Muslim world wants to see American tanks blown up and their troops killed,'' he said. ''But bin Laden and Zarqawi were the only ones actually doing it. Sidna admired them for that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sidna returned home to Toujanine a changed, yet no mellower, person. As part of his Zarqawi-fueled indoctrination, he adopted the ideology of takfir, or excommunication, which some extremists use to justify violence against nonbelievers. He began converting some of his fellow gang members into militant Salafists. Sidna ordered his sisters to cover their heads, patrolled the neighborhood for unmarried couples walking together and spent long hours arguing with his father, a Sufi, during which times he called him an infidel. He told his younger brother that he wanted to wage jihad against the Americans. Then Sidna headed off to a training camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring of 2006, Sidna traveled to a camp in northern Mali run by the G.S.P.C., the notorious Algerian-Salafi group. He prayed that those running the camp would send him to Iraq to fight against Americans. The invasion of Afghanistan, followed by the one in Iraq, attracted young men from all over North Africa eager to wage jihad against the United States. Fernando Reinares, the director of a program on global terrorism at Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, says G.S.P.C. camps served as one of the main conduits of foreign fighters into Iraq. ''They recruited individuals at the local level, trained them and then sent them to Iraq,'' he said. European police reported a growing number of G.S.P.C. cells in major cities. In 2002, authorities in Italy claimed to have disrupted a G.S.P.C. plot in Bologna to bomb the Basilica of San Petronio, which has a 15th-century fresco of the Prophet Muhammad being tormented by demons in hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sidna was disappointed when he reached the camp. The G.S.P.C. was in the midst of an overhaul. He found that the group was no longer looking for able-bodied young men to dispatch to Iraq, in part because of American pressure on North African leaders to clamp down on the migration of jihadists to Iraq. But it was also by choice. Now the G.S.P.C. had a new mission, to recruit non-Algerian militants to spread jihad south of Algeria. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sidna fit into the group's plans perfectly. The G.S.P.C.'s finances couldn't keep pace with its ambitions, however. So G.S.P.C. leaders reached out to Zarqawi, who, until he was killed by American forces in Iraq in June 2006, enjoyed not only name recognition but also a seemingly endless pile of money. With Zarqawi as matchmaker, the G.S.P.C. courted Al Qaeda itself. After lengthy negotiations, bin Laden's deputy, the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri, announced the ''blessed union'' between the G.S.P.C. and Al Qaeda on Sept. 11, 2006. He declared that the merger would be ''a bone in the throat of American and French crusaders.'' Months later, the G.S.P.C. proclaimed its new name: Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or A.Q.I.M.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A.Q.I.M. immediately set its sights on Mauritania. Not only was the country mostly vacant space and therefore a potential site for training camps, but as a close ally of the United States and one of only three Arab League states to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel, it presented an easy propaganda target. The G.S.P.C. had already sent Khaddim Ould Semane, a Mauritanian militant, back to Nouakchott with instructions to establish a cell. Semane named his group Al-Ansar Allah al-Murabitun, the Army of Allah in the Lands of Murabitun. (Murabitun was the 11th-century Islamic empire in North Africa.) He would eventually become a leader of A.Q.I.M. in Mauritania. Sidna was sent back to Nouakchott with orders to stay on the lookout for possible targets. Sidna returned to Mauritania feeling frustrated, according to his younger brother, whom I spoke to in December. Sidna knew how to shoot a gun (having served a year in the Mauritanian army), had an extensive background in theft and showed the vigor of a fundamentalist. But if he wanted to be part of Al Qaeda, he would have to earn the privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eight months after Abdallahi's election established Mauritania's democratic credentials and won it new support in the West, Sidna struck. On Christmas Eve 2007, Sidna, now 21, and two accomplices decided to stalk five French tourists just outside the town of Aleg, 150 miles east of Nouakchott. The French were picnicking in the shade of a tree around lunchtime when, authorities charge, Sidna or one of his accomplices opened fire with a Kalashnikov and killed four of them. The militants hopped into hired cars and escaped. After a three-week manhunt, through Senegal, Gambia and finally Guinea-Bissau, French intelligence agents arrested them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the day of his extradition to Mauritania, Sidna looked more like a club kid than a terrorist: blue jeans, brown leather jacket, clean-shaven. As he strutted past a battery of cameramen while walking toward the tan DC-3 waiting to fly him back to Nouakchott, he stared into one camera and said, ''Guinea-Bissau will pay dearly for mistreating God's warriors.'' The tape played on Mauritanian television and radio for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sidna escaped from prison three months later. He hid in a two-story villa that had been rented by Semane in an upscale neighborhood of Nouakchott. It was painted yellow with a white railing that wrapped around the upstairs porch. Inside, a handful of terrorists had amassed weapons, explosives and suicide belts. The day before Sidna arrived, they stole a car and parked it in the garage. (They didn't know it, but the car was being used by Mauritania's ambassador to the United States.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Days after Sidna's jailbreak, the police responded to a tip and encircled the yellow house. The militants shot and killed one policeman, sparking an intense gun battle that pockmarked the villa. The sound of automatic weapons resounded through Nouakchott's usually placid streets. After 15 minutes, the terrorists piled into the ambassador's car. Sidna filled ammunition clips in the backseat while Semane drove and others sat on the ledges of the open windows. As the garage door opened, the car burst out, broke through the police cordon and raced down the dirt roads. A terrorist was shot and fell out of a car window. But Sidna, once again, had disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police arrested him three weeks later. On the day he was brought before the court, Sidna taunted the judge, shouting, ''Our martyrs are in heaven, yours are in hell.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Algerian leader of A.Q.I.M. later said that Sidna and his companions were ''connected'' with his group, although the murder in Aleg, at least, seemed to bear Sidna's personal stamp more than that of Al Qaeda or its North African franchise. ''This is the shape of the future for Al Qaeda -- free agents laying claim to the mantle of ideological coherence, all of which goes under the name of Al Qaeda,'' said Mike McGovern, a professor at Yale University and former West Africa director for the International Crisis Group, an independent research and advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  III. End of the War As We Know It?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Are legions of these ''free agent'' jihadis, operating loosely in the name of Al Qaeda, more worrying or less worrying than a centralized Al Qaeda? Western intelligence agencies no longer agree on the nature of the threat. The Europeans generally consider A.Q.I.M. a far greater danger than do the Americans. This past fall, Germany's intelligence service stated publicly that A.Q.I.M. had established training camps in the desert of northeastern Mauritania, in addition to those already present in Algeria and Mali. But when I asked one American counterterrorism official about the claim, he sniggered. ''What are we calling a training camp?'' he said. ''Guys shooting small firearms? That happens at the local skeet range. A training camp suggests a level of organizational structure that I don't think is there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the early years after 9/11, scare-mongering about Al Qaeda dominated counterterrorism analysis in the United States. Almost anyone who partook in violence within the general confines of the Islamic world was tagged as a potential member of Al Qaeda, regardless of whom or what they were fighting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But political and religious violence in the Sahel usually had nothing to do with militias fighting for Shariah or bidding to join Al Qaeda. More often than not, the fighting involved long-running territorial disputes; ethnic, clan or tribal quibbles like those constantly plaguing Chad; and Muslims fighting Muslims, seen most vividly in Darfur. It is difficult to isolate and identify the extent to which Islam does or doesn't play into each instance of violence in the Muslim world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is little question that A.Q.I.M. is composed of anti-American Islamic militants, but some regional experts stress that this doesn't mean they take orders or receive money from bin Laden -- or pose a serious threat to American security. What, if any, are the entitlements of membership in the Al Qaeda franchise? I asked Dell Dailey, the counterterrorism coordinator at the State Department, what the G.S.P.C. gained by changing its name to A.Q.I.M. He told me that when A.Q.I.M. members joined with Al Qaeda they received a ''burst of money, maybe a couple of hundred thousand dollars, that allowed them to knock out a few early suicide bombings with a strong Al Qaeda flavor.'' The string of lethal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> included explosions aimed at government buildings and naval barracks, and the bombing of a United Nations building in Algeria that killed more than 40 people, including, for the first time, a large number of foreigners. Dailey added, ''Once they jumped on the A.Q. name, they showed an internationalist choice of targets that G.S.P.C. just hadn't done before.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once they had spent the initial infusion of money, however, A.Q.I.M. reverted to its former ways. These methods included car theft, credit-card fraud, smuggling and kidnapping. Jean-Luc Marret, a fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris who is also affiliated with Johns Hopkins University's Center for Transatlantic Relations, said that A.Q.I.M.'s fund-raising ''is not about Saudi banking and global Islamic N.G.O.'s, but small, encrusted cells, trabendo (contraband) and petty smuggling.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dell Dailey said that A.Q.I.M.'s impulse to indulge in criminal activities is partly born out of the fact that they ''can't connect to the central branch anymore,'' which affects personnel and finances. Not only are ''raw recruits'' like Sidna less able to get to Iraq or Afghanistan, but as an organization, Dailey told me, Al Qaeda is more constrained now. ''They can't move, communicate, recruit and post money as successfully as they could in the early days after 9/11,'' he said. ''We have given Al Qaeda too much credit from 9/11 onwards. We have embellished them more than they deserve.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But just because aspiring militants in Algeria, Morocco or Mauritania might find it tougher to buy a plane ticket to Amman and slip across the border into Iraq doesn't mean their grievances have disappeared. With, in the words of one American military official, ''the demand signal [for jihadists] way down in Iraq,'' there appears to be a reverse migration of North African fighters coming home to join A.Q.I.M. A result has been an injection of free-agent militants into the Sahel with crisscrossing loyalties, and no one is sure who is in command. There are even rumors of splits among the A.Q.I.M. leadership. ''The A.Q.I.M. folks in northern Mali are not a monolithic group,'' the official, who is a specialist in North Africa, told me. ''Are the Mauritanians part of A.Q.I.M.? The debate remains unresolved. Some of them are taking orders directly from A.Q.I.M. Some have gone to the camps and then went back to Mauritania to start their own franchise. And there's some home-grown factor. In Mauritania you see all of it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IV. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In early September, a month after the coup, top Mauritanian army officials learned that five vehicles carrying A.Q.I.M. fighters had crossed from northern Mali into Mauritania and were racing across the desert toward Zouerate, an iron-mining town about 500 miles north of Nouakchott. Zouerate is the heart of Mauritania's economy. Iron accounts for almost half of the nation's exports. Any disruption in Zouerate's daily routine could cripple the country. A hastily organized government patrol -- composed of 4 light-brown Land Cruisers, 19 soldiers, an officer, a civilian guide and 2 .50-caliber mounted machine guns -- headed into the desert to take on the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al Qaeda wants to destabilize our country,'' Col. Mohamed Ould El Hadi, Mauritania's director of national security, told me last month in his office in Nouakchott. It has had considerable success already. Even though A.Q.I.M.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been less grand in scale than the bombing of the United Nations building in Algiers in December 2007, its Mauritanian operations have proved more debilitating. The murder of the four French tourists in late 2007, followed by a gun assault on the Israeli Embassy in Nouakchott in early 2008, dealt a devastating blow to the tourism industry. Not two weeks after the French tourists were killed, organizers of the annual Paris-Dakar Rally, whose route normally covers a considerable stretch of Mauritania, canceled the race. (The 2009 rally relocated to South America.) Some estimate that the number of tourists who visit Mauritania is down by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one in the patrol sent from Zouerate had received American counter-terrorism training, and they soon went from hunters to hunted. Shortly after dark, they discovered a line of fresh tire tracks in the sand -- made by A.Q.I.M. fighters, who had camped on a dune in the distance. The patrol motored up the tracks while the militants watched the headlights bounce over the dunes. The militants waited as the lights grew brighter and the whine of the engines of the Land Cruisers grew louder. The lead vehicle had just climbed into view when A.Q.I.M. opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initial reports suggested that A.Q.I.M. had kidnapped the soldiers. Hoping to stop the terrorists before they returned to their sanctuary in northern Mali, the Mauritanian military asked the United States for help. The Americans refused, reaffirming the position that the junta should restore Abdallahi first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two days after the ambush, while the U.S. Embassy was still refusing to assist the ruling junta and the search for the missing soldiers continued, A.Q.I.M. issued a communique. The group boasted of a ''new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the city of Zouerate in northern Mauritania against those who obey the Jews.'' The communique went on, ''By God's grace, the brigades of Mujahideen set an ambush for the army of unbelief and apostasy that managed to take 12 soldiers prisoner, including a commander by the rank of captain . . . while the rest of Allah's enemies escaped, fleeing their failure and defeat.'' The next day, a Mauritanian official told me, a search-and-rescue team moved to an area where vultures were circling overhead and found 12 bloated, naked corpses, lined up side by side. Three of them were booby-trapped with dynamite. All but one was beheaded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of its second term, the Bush administration's strategy for the war on terror remained within the framework in which the war was first conceived -- destroy terrorist networks and promote democracy -- but the manner in which those principles were put into effect had clearly changed. Even someone like Dell Dailey, who was deeply involved for years in fighting terrorists with traditional military tactics, had come to reject the idea of embracing a military government in Mauritania just because of the presence of an Al Qaeda affiliate inside the country. In its final year, the Bush administration seemed to understand that, in places like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it had created legions of enemies with its unflinching support for President Pervez Musharraf. It hoped to avoid doing the same thing in Mauritania, even as the junta, like Musharraf, decried the former civilian leaders as corrupt and weak on terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration is continuing the recalibration of counterterrorism. President Obama has promised to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently cautioned against the militarization of foreign policy. ''Armed forces may not always be the best choice to take the lead,'' he said during a speech in Washington in January, adding later that ''we need to reallocate roles and resources in a way that places our military as an equal among many in government.'' Similar themes have been echoed lately by the secretary of defense, Robert Gates, and others engaged in counterterrorism policy. The coup by the Mauritanian junta may have been badly timed. Part of the new strategic thinking in Washington involves being less optimistic about the power of militaries to solve political problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The war against Al Qaeda will undoubtedly continue, but a more nuanced analysis of Al Qaeda has led to a more nuanced approach to combating terrorism and a reconsideration of how the strategy that guided the war on terror in its early years should be put into effect. This is partly a result of new thinking in Washington and, according to security officials, partially a result of bin Laden's questionable business model: the franchise. ''Where G.S.P.C. was, to where A.Q.I.M. is today, I just don't see the merger as a force multiplier for them,'' a senior defense official familiar with Special Operations told me. The war on terror is being reconceived, and the result may not look very much like a war at all. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government announced Monday that it would accept a system of Islamic law in the Swat valley and agreed to a truce, effectively conceding the area as a Taliban sanctuary and suspending a faltering effort by the army to crush the insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The concessions to the militants, who now control about 70 percent of the region just 100 miles from the capital, were criticized by Pakistani analysts as a capitulation by a government desperate to stop Taliban abuses and a military embarrassed at losing ground after more than a year of intermittent fighting. About 3,000 Taliban militants have kept 12,000 government troops at bay and terrorized the local population with floggings and the burning of schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accord came less than a week before the first official visit to Washington of the Pakistani army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, to meet Obama administration officials and discuss how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could improve its tactics against what the American military is now calling an industrial-strength insurgency there of Al Qaeda and the Taliban militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants have also made deep gains in neighboring Afghanistan, where the United States is sending more troops. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani government officials insisted the truce with the Taliban and the switch to the Shariah, the Islamic legal code, were consistent with the Constitution and presented no threat to the integrity of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the truce offered by the Taliban, and accepted by the authorities, rebuffed American demands for the Pakistani civilian and military authorities to stick with the fight against the militants, not make deals with them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the terms of the accord, the chief minister of the province, Amir Haider Khan Hoti, said that Pakistani troops would now go on ''reactive mode'' and fight only in retaliation for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Announced by the government of the North-West Frontier Province after consultation with President Asif Ali Zardari, the pact echoed previous government accords with the militants across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> semi-autonomous tribal areas in North and South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those regions have since become a mini-state for Qaeda and Taliban militants, who are now the focus of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted American aircraft. On Monday, what was thought to be a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kurram, a separate area close to the Afghan border, killed 31 people, Pakistani intelligence officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts are now suggesting that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be pushing the Taliban, and even some Qaeda elements, out of the tribal belt and into Swat, making the valley more important to the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking in India on the last leg of his trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Afghanistan and India, the Obama administration's special envoy to the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, did not address the truce directly but said the turmoil in Swat served as a reminder that the United States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India faced an ''enemy which poses direct threats to our leadership, our capitals, and our people.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani legal experts and other analysts warned that the decision by the authorities would embolden militants in other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This means you have surrendered to a handful of extremists,'' said Athar Minallah, a leader of a lawyers' movement that has campaigned for an independent judiciary. ''The state is under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instead of dealing with them as aggressors, the government has abdicated.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shuja Nawaz, the author of ''Crossed Swords,'' a book on the Pakistani military, said that with the accord, ''the government is ceding a great deal of space'' to the militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some Pakistani officials have recently argued that a truce was necessary in Swat because the army was unable to fight a guerrilla insurgency and civilians were suffering in the conflict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A former interior minister, Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, told the parliamentary committee on national security this month that Shariah ordinances should be introduced to ''calm the situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sherry Rehman, the government information minister, said the deal should not be seen as a concession. ''It is in no way a sign of the state's weakness,'' she said. ''The public will of the population of the Swat region is at the center of all efforts, and it should be taken into account while debating the merits of this agreement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In legislative elections a year ago, the people of Swat, a region that is about the size of Delaware and has 1.3 million residents, voted overwhelmingly for the secular Awami National Party. Since then, the Taliban have singled out elected politicians with suicide bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and chased virtually all of them from the valley. Several hundred thousand residents have also fled the fighting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of the poor who have stayed in Swat, which until the late 1960s was ruled by a prince, were calling for the Shariah courts as a way of achieving quick justice and dispensing with the long delays and corruption of the civil courts. The authorities in the North-West Frontier Province, which includes Swat, argued that the Shariah courts were not the same as strict Islamic law. The new laws, for instance, would not ban education of females or impose other strict tenets espoused by the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new accord, they said, would simply activate laws already agreed to by Benazir Bhutto in the early 1990s when she was prime minister. Similarly, the principle of Shariah courts in Swat was also agreed to by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999. In both cases, the courts, though approved, were never put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official did not have permission to speak publicly, said that the government's acceptance of the courts was an attempt to blunt efforts of the Taliban to woo Swat residents frustrated by the ineffective judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban was trying to take advantage of the local movement and desire for a judicial system,'' the official said. The official insisted that the Obama administration, informed of the accord, ''showed understanding of our strategy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said only, ''We have seen the press reports and are in touch with the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the ongoing situation in Swat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Provincial officials said the accord in Swat was struck with Maulana Sufi Muhammad. He is the father-in-law of Maulana Fazlullah, a deputy to Baitullah Mehsud, who is the head of the umbrella group for the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Muhammad is often described as more benign than his son-in-law, but the ranks of their followers and their lines of authority are fluid and overlapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2001, he took thousands of young men across the border into Afghanistan to fight jihad against the Americans. After his return he was imprisoned by Pakistani authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was released last April after agreeing to denounce violence and work to bring peace to the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the insistence that the new legal system in Swat was consistent with existing civil law, some feared that the accord was an ominous sign of the power of the militants to spread into the heartland of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the most populous and wealthiest province, the Punjab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The hardest task for the government will be to protect the Punjab against inroads by militants,'' wrote I. A. Rehman, a member of the Human Rights Commission, in the daily newspaper, Dawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Already, religious extremists have strong bases across the province and sympathizers in all arenas: political parties, services, the judiciary, the middle class, and even the media,'' he wrote. ''For its part, the government is handicapped because of its failure to offer good governance, guarantee livelihoods, and restore people's faith in the frayed judicial system.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past week, the Obama administration has expanded the covert war run by the Central Intelligence Agency inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, attacking a militant network seeking to topple the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud represent a broadening of the American campaign inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which has been largely carried out by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. Under President Bush, the United States frequently attacked militants from Al Qaeda and the Taliban involved in cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan, but had stopped short of raids aimed at Mr. Mehsud and his followers, who have played less of a direct role in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are another sign that President Obama is continuing, and in some cases extending, Bush administration policy in using American spy agencies against terrorism suspects in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as he had promised to do during his presidential campaign. At the same time, Mr. Obama has begun to scale back some of the Bush policies on the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects, which he has criticized as counterproductive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud was identified early last year by both American and Pakistani officials as the man who had orchestrated the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister and the wife of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> current president, Asif Ali Zardari. Mr. Bush included Mr. Mehsud's name in a classified list of militant leaders whom the C.I.A. and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear why the Obama administration decided to carry out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which American and Pakistani officials said occurred last Saturday and again on Monday, hitting camps run by Mr. Mehsud's network. The Saturday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was aimed specifically at Mr. Mehsud, but he was not killed, according to Pakistani and American officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Monday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials say, was aimed at a camp run by Hakeem Ullah Mehsud, a top aide to the militant. By striking at the Mehsud network, the United States may be seeking to demonstrate to Mr. Zardari that the new administration is willing to go after the insurgents of greatest concern to the Pakistani leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But American officials may also be prompted by growing concern that the militant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are increasingly putting the civilian government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a nation with nuclear weapons, at risk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For months, Pakistani military and intelligence officials have complained about Washington's refusal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Baitullah Mehsud, even while C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struck at Qaeda figures and leaders of the network run by Jalaluddin Haqqani, a militant leader believed responsible for a campaign of violence against American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to one senior Pakistani official, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence service on two occasions in recent months gave the United States detailed intelligence about Mr. Mehsud's whereabouts, but said the United States had not acted on the information. Bush administration officials had charged that it was the Pakistanis who were reluctant to take on Mr. Mehsud and his network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came after a visit to Islamabad last week by Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Holbrooke declined to talk about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Mr. Mehsud. The White House also declined to speak about Mr. Mehsud or the decisions that led up to the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A C.I.A. spokesman also declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior Pakistani officials are scheduled to arrive in Washington next week at a time of rising tension over a declared truce between the Pakistani government and militants in the Swat region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the administration has not publicly criticized the Pakistanis, several American officials said in interviews in recent days that they believe appeasing the militants would only weaken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government. Mr. Holbrooke said in the interview that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and others would make clear in private, and in detail, why they were so concerned about what was happening in Swat, the need to send more Pakistani forces to the west, and why the deteriorating situation in the tribal areas added to instability in Afghanistan and threats to American forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Past efforts to cut deals with the insurgents failed, and many administration officials believe that they ultimately weakened the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Obama administration officials face the same intractable problems that the Bush administration did in trying to prod </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> toward a different course. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still deploys the overwhelming majority of its troops along the Indian border, not the border with Afghanistan, and its intelligence agencies maintain shadowy links to the Taliban even as they take American funds to fight them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under standard policy for covert operations, the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have not been publicly acknowledged either by the Obama administration or the Bush administration. Using Predators and the more heavily armed Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the C.I.A. has carried out more than 30 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since last September, according to American and Pakistani officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed a number of senior Qaeda figures, including Abu Jihad al-Masri and Usama al-Kini,  who is believed to have helped plan the 1998 American Embassy bombings in East Africa and last year's bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American Special Operations troops based in Afghanistan have also carried out a number of operations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas since early September, when a commando raid that killed a number of militants was publicly condemned by Pakistani officials. According to a senior American military official, the commando missions since September have been primarily to gather intelligence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meetings hosted by the Obama administration next week will include senior officials from both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan; Mrs. Clinton is to hold a rare joint meeting on Thursday with foreign ministers from the two countries. Also, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief, will meet with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lt. Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military spy service, will accompany General Kayani. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bomber Kills More Than 30</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police on Friday blamed a suicide bomber for a powerful explosion that killed more than 30 people and wounded at least 50 in the Pakistani city of Dera Ismail Khan, according to residents and Pakistani television reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bombing, aimed at the funeral of a Shiite man who had been shot, set off chaos in the city of a million people on the edge of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. Mobs attacked security forces, ransacked shops and surrounded hospitals  said the mayor, Abdur Rauf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have reduced Al Qaeda's global reach but heightened the threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the group disperses its cells here and fights to maintain its sanctuaries, Pakistani intelligence officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials acknowledge that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and raids by the Pakistani military are proving effective, having killed as many as 80 Qaeda fighters in the past year. But they express growing alarm that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in particular are having an increasingly destabilizing effect on their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They also voiced fears that the expected arrival of 17,000 American troops in Afghanistan this spring and summer would add to the stresses by pushing more Taliban fighters into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assessment was provided during a two-hour briefing by senior analysts and officials of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the agency's policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The analysis reflected the increasing public pressure on the Pakistani government to oppose the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which are deeply unpopular here for the civilian casualties they have inflicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it also underscored ominous signs of Al Qaeda's resilience and pointed to new and unintended dangers for American policy in the region -- a rapidly destabilized, nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a state with a weak civilian government and a military struggling to fight an expanding insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sobering Pakistani assessment was in contrast to the optimism voiced earlier this month by the new American director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the Pakistani analysis agreed with Mr. Blair's conclusion that Al Qaeda's ability to conduct large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States was most likely degraded, it also signaled no cessation to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban aimed at undermining </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani officials suggested that Al Qaeda was replenishing killed fighters and midlevel leaders with less experienced but more hard-core militants, who are considered more dangerous because they have fewer allegiances to local Pakistani tribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda was using sophisticated Web sites and sleeper cells across the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia to enlist young fighters who were less patient or inclined to plan and carry out far-reaching global </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and who had instead redirected their energies on more immediate targets and on fomenting insurgency in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Qaeda leaders have also increased their financing and logistical support for the Taliban and other militant groups, having come to see the survival of Qaeda sanctuaries as dependent on the ability of the Taliban in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hold territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's morphing into a monster and growing uglier,'' said one senior Pakistani intelligence official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has indicated that the impact on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of more American troops in Afghanistan will be among the most important topics at his meetings in Washington this week, Pakistani officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani intelligence and military officials say there is no argument that Qaeda fighters must be hunted down; they provide targeting information to the C.I.A., which remotely pilots the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But they complain that the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cause too many civilian casualties and that they hand the militants a propaganda windfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials defended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> although they acknowledge that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone will not rout Al Qaeda and the Taliban from the safe havens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al-Qaeda and its allies are resilient,'' said a United States counterterrorism official.  ''But there's real value in keeping them off balance in the tribal areas. They come to doubt their security, their hosts, even each other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it has captured some 630 Qaeda fighters and senior leaders since 2001. But the assessment underscored the difficulties still faced by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces; in that time, nearly 1,600 of its troops were killed and more than 3,700 were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani intelligence assessment found that Al Qaeda had adapted to the blows to its command structure by shifting ''to conduct decentralized operations under small but well-organized regional groups'' within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American counterterrorism officials have long complained that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protects some militant groups like the Taliban as a proxy force, a charge that Pakistani officials say is no longer true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say the longstanding ties are coming back to haunt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the jihadist Frankenstein monster that was created by the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani intelligence service is now increasingly turning on its creators,'' Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst, said in an interview on the Council on Foreign Relations' Web site on Jan. 28, two weeks before he was named a chairman of President Obama's strategic review of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are other signs that Al Qaeda is under stress but adapting. Al Qaeda has given up training sites and shifted to mobile training teams, which Pakistani intelligence officials say are still effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They often consist of just a few bomb-making or tactical experts schooling a handful of fighters in a private house, according to a mid-level ISI agent who works in the tribal belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The flow of new recruits comes largely from countries like Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Somalia and Uzbekistan, Pakistani intelligence officials said. They often travel through Iran, enter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through Baluchistan Province and then move onto Waziristan for training, the agent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The impact of the new Qaeda emphasis on operations inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was on full view in Swat, an area about 100 miles north of the capital, Islamabad, where the Pakistani Army agreed to a truce last week with the Pakistani Taliban, who control 70 percent of the territory, the agent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Uzbeks affiliated with Al Qaeda carried out the brunt of the militants' operations against civilians and the army in Swat, the agent and Pakistani military analysts said. The Uzbeks, who were driven across the border from Afghanistan with the Taliban and Qaeda after 2001, have been particularly ruthless as they helped their allies secure sanctuary in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They have now been unleashed on Pakistani soldiers in Swat, the agent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of the Taliban in Swat, was backed by about a half-dozen Arab fighters from Al Qaeda who served as the ''main motivators,'' the agent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Arabs who traveled from the Qaeda bases in Waziristan across the tribal belt to Swat are held in high esteem by Pakistani Taliban fighters, the agent said. ''The Arabs motivate the local guys, who see them as people who have forsaken all their money for jihad,'' the agent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have killed senior Qaeda figures had disrupted the lives of militants in North and South Waziristan, according to a fighter who goes by the name of Abdullah and who was interviewed in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We now often sleep in the river beds or under the eucalyptus trees,'' he said, adding that people were constantly on alert for the sound of the aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was little doubt that the killing of Usama al-Kini, a Qaeda operative who was the senior commander for operations inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, represented a setback to morale and operations, the fighter said. ''He was very popular and very sociable with the ordinary people,'' the fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kini, a Kenyan, was killed in January near Wana, the capital of South Waziristan. He was described by Pakistani law enforcement officials as the mastermind of the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Arab leaders of Al Qaeda were intent on promoting their fighters up through the ranks to overcome the loss of leaders like Mr. Kini, the fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Arabs have a strategy to elevate people to a higher position,'' he said. ''If someone is killed there is always a replacement. The training goes on.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon E. Panetta, the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Wednesday that the agency's campaign against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas was the ''most effective weapon'' the Obama administration had to combat Al Qaeda's top leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. in recent months has intensified its covert campaign of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas, carrying out more than 30 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda and Taliban leaders from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. Mr. Panetta stopped short of directly acknowledging the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but he said that ''operational efforts'' focusing on Qaeda leaders had been successful. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is for that reason that the president and the vice president and everyone else supports continuing that effort,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta's comments were the most candid to date about the Obama administration's decision to continue -- and in some cases expand on -- the Bush administration's covert operations against Al Qaeda. Privately, American officials have said that the C.I.A. missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed a large cadre of Qaeda leaders since last summer, although Pakistani intelligence officials say they fear the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are further destabilizing their already fragile country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta's comments came during a discussion with reporters two weeks after he took over at C.I.A. headquarters. He also said that the spy agency had begun producing a daily report to the White House about the world financial crisis -- another sign that American intelligence agencies are increasingly nervous about how it could affect global security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani concerns about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came up during meetings this week in Washington between Obama administration officials and Pakistani military and civilian leaders. Despite hours of discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday, the American and Pakistani sides remained somewhat wary of each other's motives and strategies to fight militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials have told their American counterparts that they are doing everything they can to fight extremists in the mountainous border region. The delegation also sought to reassure administration officials that their recent deal to allow Islamic law in the Swat Valley was not surrendering to the Taliban, but rather an attempt to drive a wedge between hard-core Taliban leaders and local pro-Taliban Islamists who might be wooed back to the government's camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I guess I remain skeptical,'' Mr. Panetta said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Responding to the American concerns, one Pakistani diplomat said the decision in Swat was ''a local solution, and the United States should not be worried about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Relations between the C.I.A. and the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful military spy agency, have frayed in recent years amid American accusations that the agency has maintained ties to militant groups planning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the ISI's chief, told White House and State Department officials that the agency had purged itself of ''rogue elements,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke anonymously because he was describing delicate discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meetings are part of a broad Obama administration review currently under way about Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona,  warned Wednesday that the additional 17,000 troops being sent to Afghanistan by President Obama needed to be followed by an overhaul of American strategy. ''When you aren't winning in this kind of war, you are losing,'' Mr. McCain said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He called for more than doubling the Afghan Army to as many as 200,000 troops, and for more nonmilitary assistance to Kabul to strengthen civil institutions and economy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensifying political battle between the pro-American president and the main opposition leader is  shaping up as a potential crisis for the Obama administration  as it tries to focus the government on fighting the Qaeda and Taliban insurgency here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The domestic struggle will almost certainly deflect attention from that fight as President Asif Ali Zardari and his archrival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, duke it out and as street protests persist, politicians and analysts said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It could also result in shifting political alliances, including new opportunities for the religious right that would be inimical to Washington's interests, and even  serve to make the Pakistani military restive for power again if the situation continued to worsen, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crisis was set off by a  Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday that bars Mr. Sharif, and his brother, Shahbaz, from elected office. The decision was  widely interpreted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a raw political maneuver  engineered by Mr. Zardari to diminish the power of the two popular opposition figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani described the ruling as damaging to democracy. A daily newspaper published by a major supporter of Mr. Zardari's said the resulting political battle could be so debilitating that nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could end up in the ranks of failed nations alongside Somalia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The two parties are going for the kill,'' said The Daily Times. ''As in the past they might both come a cropper,'' it added, suggesting that each would lose out if the military stepped in again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spokesmen for Mr. Zardari  denied the ruling  had been politically driven, and said that Mr. Zardari deplored the Sharifs' disqualification from public office. But they said Mr. Sharif's intemperate statements after the ruling  and the street protests made it imperative for the president to impose executive rule in Punjab, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous and most important province, where Shahbaz Sharif served as chief minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''After the demonstrations it became obvious the province could not be run in accordance with the Constitution,'' said Farhatullah Babar, the presidential spokesman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the military has ruled for more than half of the 61 years since independence and civilian governments have rarely completed a full term, combat between senior politicians is quite familiar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1990s, Mr. Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, the wife of Mr. Zardari who was assassinated in December 2007, dislodged each other as prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the 1990s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was under a broad swath of American sanctions. This time, American interests are more intensely intertwined with the outcome of domestic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration, which this week hosted the Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez  Kayani, in Washington, has had little to say about the unfolding political drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Washington was certainly surprised by the court move and very concerned, both in political and military circles,'' said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has backed Mr. Zardari as president, arguing that as a man whose wife was killed by terrorists he understands the importance of the fight against what the American military is now calling an industrial-strength insurgency in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in the tribal areas increased significantly  after Mr. Zardari came to power in September. Mr. Zardari has given the Americans his support for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> although the Pakistani government publicly complains about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But his reputation in Washington would be likely to suffer as a consequence of his moves against the Sharif brothers, said Talat Masood, a retired army general, who frequently meets with American officials when they come to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is deflecting the attention of the whole country to something that is so irrelevant,'' said Mr. Masood. ''He is banking on the United States, but America will only support him up to a point.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The moves against the Sharif brothers are likely to have  upset the army, even though Nawaz Sharif was ousted from his second term as prime minister by an army coup.  The army ''must be boiling inside,'' Mr. Masood said. ''How can they tolerate this state of affairs?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bulk of army soldiers  come from Punjab, are nationalistic in their outlook, and have a natural inclination toward Mr. Sharif's party, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General  Kayani has vowed to keep the army out of politics, and was serious about his pledge, Pakistani officials said. But there could come a point where political instability became so great, the army would feel to compelled to step in, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By ordering one of his main political allies, the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, to take over governance of the province, Mr. Zardari was hitting directly at the power center of the Sharif brothers, and, in effect, humiliating them, politicians said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some said Nawaz Sharif was now likely to  work assiduously to bolster his popularity against Mr. Zardari. The president's pro-American stance is anathema to large segments of the population, and  Mr. Sharif could seek Islamist religious parties that have opposed American policy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to come to his side, some politicians said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or the religious forces could gravitate to Mr. Sharif without his open encouragement, said Ishaq Khan Khakwani, a member of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-Q, and a former minister in the Musharraf government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The religious forces will come with Nawaz Sharif,'' Mr. Khawani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since Wednesday's court ruling, Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party that advocates Islamic law in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has declared that its supporters will join the lawyers' movement in a long march planned for March 12 to mark the dismissal two years ago of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nawaz Sharif said he and his brother would spearhead the lawyers' march, and join  in a sit-in planned at the conclusion of the march in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The size of the crowd during the lawyers' protest from Lahore to Islamabad, and the composition of the march could be a defining moment in the contest between Mr. Zardari and the Sharif forces, politicians said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emerging outlines of President Obama's plan for Afghanistan include proposals to shift more American efforts toward problems in neighboring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to seek some kind of political reconciliation with the vast majority of insurgents in the region, according to administration officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plan reflects in part a conclusion within the administration that most of the insurgent foot soldiers in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are ''reconcilable'' and can be pried away from the hard-core organizations of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At least 70 percent of the insurgents, and possibly more, can be encouraged to lay down their arms with the proper incentives, administration officials have said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A strategic review nearing completion is being carried out by a team of high-ranking administration officials whose recommendations will be subject to Mr. Obama's approval. After seven years of a United States-led war effort in Afghanistan, officials involved in the review say that the military to date has succeeded primarily in driving the most hard-core Taliban and other extremist militants out of Afghanistan and into western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the mountainous tribal areas and the city of Quetta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To put more pressure on those Pakistani sanctuaries, United States and Pakistani officials said they expected the plan to recommend at least a continuation of what amounts to a covert war carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft for missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on insurgent hide-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plan will also call for an increase in military and financial aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, though there was still a debate on just how much additional aid should be provided, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One senior Obama official said the military aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be aimed at trying to get its army to focus more on counterinsurgency and less on its long-running feud with India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., speaking to NATO allies this week in Brussels, called 5 percent of the Taliban ''incorrigible -- not susceptible to anything other than being defeated.'' A senior European diplomat involved in Afghanistan said officials believed that number to be 100 to 1,000 Qaeda and Taliban members. Mr. Biden said he believed that ''another 25 percent or so'' were uncertain about their commitment to the insurgency, while about 70 percent were involved because it meant ''getting paid.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But how exactly the Afghan government and the United States will pry away those insurgents remained unclear. Whatever is decided must be presented by the Afghan government, Mr. Biden said. ''I do think it is worth engaging and determining whether or not there are those who are willing to participate in a secure and stable Afghan state,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden's comments echoed those made by Mr. Obama during an interview last week with The New York Times, in which he said reconciliation in Afghanistan could be comparable to the successful American effort to reconcile with Sunni militias in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior military officials have submitted three separate reviews to the White House: those from Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of American forces in the region; and Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, of the National Security Council. That work has contributed to the final package being assembled by Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst who is chairman of the administration's strategic review. Others involved in the review include Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and Michele A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials said Mr. Obama would probably announce the findings late next week or the week after, in advance of an international conference on Afghanistan that is scheduled for the end of the month in The Hague. Drafts of the final strategy are expected to be reviewed by a cabinet-level panel of Mr. Obama's national security team next week. A senior Pentagon official said the review would set out specific goals over the next three to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While officials said no decision had been reached on the level of nonmilitary financial assistance to be offered to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, senior Congressional aides pointed out that before leaving the Senate for the White House, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden sponsored legislation to triple nonmilitary aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the next five years, to $1.5 billion a year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke and General Petraeus briefed senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday about the review. Congressional aides said a similar bill providing for increased aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would soon be reintroduced by the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John  Kerry of Massachusetts, and the ranking Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aid proposal, there is agreement that the Afghan National Army, which has proved to be an effective force for internal security and has earned popular respect, should be expanded -- but no decision has been made on its ultimate size, according to senior Pentagon officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several European officials said that the overarching theme behind the Afghanistan review was that NATO was looking for a way out of Afghanistan, and that everything done now was toward that end. ''The goal now is simply to get to a point to prevent Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from becoming a place from which you can launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the West,'' a senior European official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has sounded a similar theme, although not quite so starkly. ''The mission is to prevent the Taliban from retaking power against a democratically elected government in Afghanistan and thus turning Afghanistan, potentially again, into a haven for Al Qaeda and other extremist groups,'' Mr. Gates said on National Public Radio this week, setting ambitions for the military that are far more limited than the stated goals under the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We need to have goals, at least in the near- to midterm, that are achievable,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not clear whether the Obama administration intends to extend the secret authorizations signed last summer by President George W. Bush that allow American commandos to carry out limited raids inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In carrying out missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the C.I.A. has steadily developed its own network of sources in the tribal areas, and combined with improved information-sharing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main intelligence agency in recent months, as well as some technical advances like installing more mobile towers to intercept cellphone calls, the agency has been getting much better intelligence on its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets than it did just a few months ago, officials said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONLY if our troop levels hit 100,000 and fighting floods over into Taliban havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will Washington be likely to look hard at the alternative policy for Afghanistan -- withdrawing most American forces and refocusing our power on containing, deterring and diplomatically encircling the terrorist threat. But by then it will be too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama is now confronting the classic problem from hell: either do more to stave off defeat and hope to get lucky, or withdraw and face charges of defeatism and perhaps new terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Obama's goal is to ''ensure'' that Afghanistan is not a sanctuary for terrorists, which effectively restates his campaign call for victory there. Thus, he recently decided to add 17,000 American troops to the more than 35,000 already in Afghanistan. But his goal of eliminating the Taliban threat is not achievable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama needs to consider another path. Our strategy in Afghanistan should emphasize what we do best (containing and deterring, and forging coalitions) and downgrade what we do worst (nation-building in open-ended wars). It should cut our growing costs and secure our interests by employing our power more creatively and practically. It must also permit us -- and this is critical -- to focus more American resources and influence on the far more dire situation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We can't defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan, as the last seven years have shown. Numbers are part of the problem: most Taliban are members of Afghanistan's majority tribe, the Pashtuns. More confounding, the Taliban and their Qaeda allies have found in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a refuge that has proved almost impregnable. These factors make overcoming the enemy in Afghanistan infinitely harder than it was in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What we can do is effectively reduce the risk of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Afghanistan against its neighbors, the United States and its allies. We can do this in a way that would allow for the withdrawal of American forces, though economic and military aid would continue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first step is to provide significantly increased economic support, arms and training to friendly Afghans as United States combat forces gradually depart over, say, three years. We could use the intervening time to increase present counterinsurgency operations to better protect Afghans and give them a boost to fight on their own, if they have the will. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second step is to try to separate less extremist elements of the Taliban from their leadership and from Al Qaeda. Mr. Obama is already considering reaching out to Taliban moderates, and he could do this through the Afghan government and covert contacts. No group is monolithic once tested with carrots and sticks, as we saw in Northern Ireland and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban are no exception. While most of them want to drive America out, they have no inherent interest in exporting terrorism. As nasty as the Taliban are, America's vital interests do not require their exclusion from power in Afghanistan, so long as they don't support international terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Third, while we should talk to the Taliban, Washington can't rely on their word and so must fashion a credible deterrent. The more the Taliban set up shop inside Afghanistan, the more vulnerable they will be to American punishment. Taliban leaders must have good reason to fear America's military reach. Their leaders could be hit by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same goes for their poppy fields, from which they derive considerable income. Most important, Mr. Obama must do what the Bush team inexplicably never seemed to succeed in doing -- stop the flow of funds to the Taliban that comes mainly through the Arab Gulf states. At the same time, he could let some money trickle in to reward good behavior. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fourth, President Obama has to ring Afghanistan with a coalition of neighbors to show the Taliban they have no place to seek succor, even after an American departure. The group would include China, India, Russia, NATO allies, and yes, Iran. They all share a considerable interest in stemming the spread of Afghan drugs and Islamic extremism. China and Russia should be more willing to help in this anti-Taliban effort as the American military presence recedes from their sensitive borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, both the heart of the problem and the key to its solution. The peaceful future of the region depends on the resolve and ability of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secular and moderate religious leaders to provide decent government to their people. China, India, Iran and Russia might cooperate with Washington simply because there's no motivation greater than the nightmare of extremists controlling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  India in particular wants to combat extremism in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It could do that by reducing its forces on the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for example, thereby allowing Pakistani moderates to focus their attention more on the growing and already formidable extremist threat within. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Withdrawal need not mean defeat for America and victory for terrorists, if the full range of American power is used effectively. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger proved that by countering the nasty aftereffects of Vietnam's fall to communism in a virtuoso display of American power. They did this by engaging in triangular diplomacy with China and the Soviet Union; brokering a de facto peace between Israel and Egypt; and re-establishing American prowess in Asia as a counterweight to emerging Chinese power. By 1978, three years after Saigon's fall, America's position in the area was stronger than at any time since the end of World War II. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I don't know whether the power extrication strategy sketched out here would be less or more risky than our present course. But trying to eliminate the Taliban and Qaeda threat in Afghanistan is unattainable, while finding a way to live with, contain and deter the Taliban is an achievable goal. After all, we don't insist on eliminating terrorist threats from Somalia, Yemen and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Furthermore, this strategy of containing and deterring is far better suited to American power than the current approach of counterinsurgency and nation-building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama and Congress owe it to both Afghans and Americans to explore a strategy of power extrication before they make another major decision to expand the war.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KANDAHAR, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber on foot struck a police convoy  about to head out on a poppy eradication mission in southern Afghanistan on Monday morning, killing 11 people and wounding 28, the police said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was one of several in recent days connected to the overall battle against the Taliban insurgency backed by Al Qaeda. NATO and American troops are fighting the insurgency along the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and in the southern provinces near Kandahar, particularly Zabul and Helmand, the world's largest heroin-producing region. Drug profits fuel the insurgency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dawood Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand, said the success of recent efforts by security forces to destroy opium-poppy fields had prompted the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the counternarcotics convoy, which was in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. ''This was a work by Taliban and drug smugglers,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than three-quarters of the supplies for the NATO and American troops flow through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at choking off supply routes also have become more frequent and more brazen. On Monday, in the northwestern city of Peshawar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, about 100 militants attacked a NATO supply hub, Al Faisal terminal, using rifles, gasoline bombs and rocket-propelled grenades to damage tankers, container trucks and Humvees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A firefight took place when the police responded, a security guard at the terminal said, but the attackers escaped after blasting a hole in a wall of the compound. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sixteen trucks were destroyed Sunday during an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a container terminal in Peshawar, a witness said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In December, militants attacked supply depots used by NATO in Peshawar and destroyed 300 cargo trucks and Humvees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban and Qaeda-backed insurgents are deeply entrenched in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and the C.I.A. has pursued them there in what amounts to a limited covert war, using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft for missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late Sunday, such a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out on the house of a local militant commander in Bannu, a region in restive North-West Frontier Province about 120 miles south of Peshawar and along the border with North Waziristan. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed four people, including two Arabs, residents and intelligence officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local and Western intelligence officials say the area serves as a transit route into and out of Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed a deadly weekend for the coalition forces. Three British soldiers were killed in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Helmand on Sunday, and a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan killed four American soldiers. A French soldier was killed Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three weeks ago, a roadside bomb, also in southern Afghanistan, killed four American soldiers in the deadliest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year on the coalition, which is led by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taliban insurgents now control large swaths of the south, and Gen. David D. McKiernan, the top American commander in Afghanistan, last month described the southern part of Afghanistan as ''at best, stalemated.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are currently about 36,000 American troops in Afghanistan, and President Obama announced last month the deployment of 17,000 more. They are expected to be in place by the summer, with many expected to be stationed in the south. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A missile fired by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed at least four people late Sunday at the house of a militant commander in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the latest use of what intelligence officials have called their most effective weapon against Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Pentagon officials say the remotely piloted planes, which can beam back live video for up to 22 hours, have done more than any other weapons system to track down insurgents and save American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The planes have become one of the military's favorite weapons despite many  shortcomings resulting from the rush to get them into the field. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An explosion in demand for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is contributing to new thinking inside the Pentagon about how to develop and deploy new weapons systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Air Force officials acknowledge that more than a third of their unmanned Predator spy planes -- which are 27 feet long, powered by a high-performance snowmobile engine, and cost $4.5 million apiece --  have crashed, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pilots, who fly them from trailers halfway around the world using joysticks and computer screens, say some of the controls are clunky. For example, the missile-firing button sits dangerously close to the switch that shuts off the plane's engines. Pilots are also in such short supply that the service recently put out a call for retirees to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But military leaders say they can easily live with all that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the height of the cold war, the military has tended to chase the boldest and most technologically advanced solution to every threat, leading to long delays and cost overruns that result in rarely used fighter jets that cost $143 million apiece, and plans for a $3 billion destroyer that the Navy says it can no longer afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now the Pentagon appears to be warming up to Voltaire's saying, ''The perfect is the enemy of the good.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In speeches, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has urged his weapons buyers to rush out ''75 percent solutions over a period of months'' rather than waiting for ''gold-plated'' solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And as the Obama administration prepares its first budget, officials say they plan to free up more money for simpler systems like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that can pay dividends now, especially as fighting intensifies in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A rare behind-the-scenes look at the use of the Predator  shows both the difficulties and the rewards in pushing out weapons more quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'll be really candid,'' said Col. Eric Mathewson, who directs the Air Force's task force on unmanned aerial systems. ''We're on the ragged edge.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the service has been scrambling to train more pilots, who fly the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> via satellite links from the western United States, to keep up with a near-tripling of daily missions in the last two years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Field commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the Air Force is in charge of the Predators, say their ability to linger over an area for hours, streaming instant video warnings of insurgent activity, has been crucial to reducing threats from roadside bombs and identifying terrorist compounds. The C.I.A. is in charge of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where more than three dozen missiles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been launched against Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Considered a novelty  a few years ago, the Air Force's fleet has grown to 195 Predators and 28 Reapers, a new and more heavily armed cousin of the Predator. Both models are made by General Atomics, a contractor based in San Diego. Including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the Army has used to counter roadside bombs and tiny hand-launched models that can help soldiers to peer past the next hill or building, the total number of military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has soared to 5,500, from 167 in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The urgent need for more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has meant bypassing usual procedures. Some of the 70 Predator crashes, for example, stemmed from decisions to deploy the planes before they had completed testing and to hold off replacing control stations to avoid interrupting the supply of intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The context was to do just the absolute minimum needed to sustain the fight now, and accept the risks, while making fixes as you go along,'' Colonel  Mathewson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is easier, of course, for the military to take more risks with unmanned planes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Complaints about civilian casualties, particularly from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have stirred some concerns among human rights advocates. Military officials say the ability of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to observe targets for lengthy periods makes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more accurate. They also said they do not fire if they think civilians are nearby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Predators were still undergoing basic testing when they were rushed into use in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and then hastily armed with missiles after the September 2001 terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was only after the military turned to new counterinsurgency techniques in early 2007,  that demand for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became almost insatiable. Since then, Air Force Lt. Gen. Gary North, the air-component commander for the combined forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the service has gone to ''amazing lengths'' to increase their use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Predators and Reapers are now flying 34 surveillance patrols each day in Iraq and Afghanistan, up from 12 in 2006. They are also transmitting 16,000 hours of video each month, some of it directly to troops on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The strains of these growing demands were evident on a recent visit to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz., one of four bases where Air National Guard units  have been ordered to full-time duty to help alleviate crew shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Guard members, along with Air Force crews at a base in the Nevada desert, are 7,000 to 8,000 miles away from the planes they are flying. Most of the crews sit at 1990s-style computer banks filled with screens, inside dimly lit trailers. Many fly missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a recent day, at 1:15 p.m. in Tucson -- 1:15 the next morning in Afghanistan --  a pilot and sensor operator were staring at gray-toned video from the Predator's infrared camera, which can make even the darkest night scene surprisingly clear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crew was scanning a road, looking for -- but not finding -- signs of anyone planting improvised explosive devices or lying in wait for a convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the Predator circled at 16,000 feet, the dark band of a river and craggy hills came into view, along with ribbons of farmland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We spend 70 to 80 percent of our time doing this, just scanning roads,'' said the pilot, Matthew Morrison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At other times, the crews monitor insurgent compounds and watch over troops in battle. ''When you're on the radio with a guy on the ground, and he is out of breath and you can hear the weapons fire in the background, you are every bit as engaged as if you were actually there,'' Major Morrison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Predators spot possible targets, officers monitoring video at command centers in Iraq and Afghanistan decide whether to order an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Col. Gregg A. Davies, commander of the group that flies Predators for the Arizona Guard, said fighter planes with bigger bombs are often sent in to make the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, the Air Force says, Predators and Reapers shot missiles on 244 of the 10,949 missions in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Air Force officials said a few crew members have had a difficult time watching the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And some pilots said it can be hard to transition from being a computer-screen warrior to dinner at home or their children's soccer games. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another problem has been that few pilots wanted to give up flying fighter jets to operate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Given the shortages, the Air Force has temporarily blocked transfers out of theprogram. It also has begun training officers as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pilots who have had little or no experience flying conventional planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colonel Mathewson, director of the Air Force's task force on unmanned aerial systems, said that while upgrades have been made to control stations, the service plans to eventually shift to simpler and more intuitive ground systems that could allow one remote pilot to control several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Now, pilots say, it takes up to 17 steps -- including entering data into pull-down windows -- to fire a missile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And even though 13 of the 70 Predator crashes have occurred over the last 18 months, officials said the accident rate has fallen as  flying hours have shot up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All told, 55 have been lost because of   equipment failure, operator errors or weather. Four were shot down in Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq;  11 were lost in combat situations, like  running out of fuel while protecting troops under fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the demand for video intelligence, the Air Force is equipping 50 manned turbo-prop planes with similar cameras. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it is developing new camera systems for Reapers that could vastly expand the  intelligence each plane can collect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P. W. Singer, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the Predators have already had ''an incredible effect,'' though the remote control raised obvious questions about whether the military could become ''more cavalier'' about  using force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he said, ''these systems today are very much Model T Fords. These things will only get more advanced.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to senior administration officials, two of the high-level reports on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan that have been forwarded to the White House in recent weeks have called for broadening the target area  to include a major insurgent sanctuary in and around the city of Quetta. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mullah Muhammad Omar, who led the Taliban government that was ousted in the American-led invasion in 2001, has operated with near impunity out of the region for years, along with many of his deputies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The extensive missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being carried out by Central Intelligence Agency-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have until now been limited to the tribal areas, and have never been extended into Baluchistan, a sprawling province that is under the authority of the central government, and which abuts the parts of southern Afghanistan where recent fighting has been the fiercest. Fear remains within the American government that extending the raids would worsen tensions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complains that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violate its sovereignty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some American officials say the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas have forced some leaders of the  Taliban and Al Qaeda  to flee south toward Quetta, making them more vulnerable. In separate reports, groups led by both Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of American forces in the region, and Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, a top White House official on Afghanistan, have recommended expanding American operations outside the tribal areas if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot root out the strengthening insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of Mr. Obama's advisers are also urging him to sustain orders issued last summer by President George W.  Bush to continue Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a wider range of targets in the tribal areas.  They also are recommending preserving the option to conduct cross-border ground actions, using C.I.A. and Special Operations commandos, as was done in September. Mr. Bush's orders also named as targets a wide variety of insurgents seeking to topple </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government. Mr. Obama has said little in public about how broadly he wants to pursue those groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the National Security Council, Mike Hammer, declined to provide details, saying, ''We're still working hard to finalize the review on Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the president requested.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No other officials would talk on the record about the issue, citing the administration's continuing internal deliberations and the politically volatile nature of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is fair to say that there is wide agreement to sustain and continue these covert programs,'' said one senior administration official. ''One of the foundations on which the recommendations to the president will be based is that we've got to sustain the disruption of the safe havens.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's top national security advisers, known as the Principals Committee, met Tuesday to begin debating all aspects of Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy. Senior administration officials say Mr. Obama has made no decisions, but is expected to do so in coming days after hearing the advice of that group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any expansion of the war is bound to upset those in Mr. Obama's party who worry that he is sinking further into a lengthy conflict in Afghanistan, even while reducing forces in Iraq. It is possible that the decisions about covert actions will never be publicly announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several administration and military officials stressed that they continued to prod the Pakistani military to take the lead in a more aggressive campaign to root out Taliban and Qaeda fighters who are attacking American forces in Afghanistan and increasingly destabilizing nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consumed by political turmoil, fear of financial collapse and a spreading insurgency, American officials say they have few illusions that the United States will be able to rely on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own forces. However, each </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Predators or ground forces reverberates in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and Mr. Obama will be weighing that cost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on ''The Charlie Rose Show'' on PBS last week that the White House strategy review addresses the ''safe haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- making sure that Afghanistan doesn't provide a capability in the long run or an environment in which Al Qaeda could return or the Taliban could return.'' But another senior official cautioned that ''with the targets now spreading, an expanding U.S. role inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be more than anyone there can stomach.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of the same set of decisions, according to senior civilian and military officials familiar with the internal White House debate, Mr. Obama will have to choose from among a range of options for future American commitments to Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His core decision may be whether to scale back American ambitions there to simply assure it does not become a sanctuary for terrorists. ''We are taking this back to a fundamental question,'' a senior diplomat involved in the discussions said. ''Can you ever get a central government in Afghanistan to a point where it can exercise control over the country? That was the problem Bush never really confronted.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second option, officials say, is to significantly boost the American commitment to train Afghan troops, with Americans taking on the Taliban with increasing help from the Afghan military. President Bush pursued versions of that strategy, but the training always took longer and proved less successful than plans called for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A third option would involve devoting full American and NATO resources to a large-scale counterinsurgency effort. But Mr. Obama would be bound to face considerable opposition within NATO, whose leaders he will meet with early next month in Strasbourg, France. At the very time the United States is seeking to expand its presence in Afghanistan, many of the allies are scheduled to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on militant havens inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, administration officials say the Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas have been effective at killing 9 of Al Qaeda's top 20 leaders, and the aerial campaign was recently expanded to focus on the Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, as well as his fighters and training camps.  American intelligence officials say that many  top Taliban commanders remain in hiding in and around Quetta, but some Afghan officials say that other senior Taliban leaders have fled to the Pakistani port city of Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or American commando raids in the city of Quetta or the teeming Afghan settlements and refugee camps around the city and near the Afghan border would carry high risks of civilian casualties, American officials acknowledge. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- In the mountains of northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the psychological impact of America's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be measured by this: Some locals have given up drinking Lipton tea, out of a growing conviction that the Central Intelligence Agency is using the tea bags as homing beacons for its pilotless planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities there is a different impact: a sense that the gizmos, created to instill fear in America's enemies,  only reveal the fears of Americans to take casualties themselves. There, a song of protest taunts the world's most powerful country for sending robots to do a man's job: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America's heartless terrorism Killing people like insects But honor doesn't fear power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as the C.I.A. crosses names off its list of Al Qaeda leaders with each successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Washington is struggling to understand the long-term implications of a push-button conflict. One question is whether the robot wars are only a holding action in a far more complex political and ideological war, against an enemy whose resilience America  still doesn't fully understand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama and his advisers acknowledge that it will take years, and billions of dollars, before Afghanistan's own army and police can secure that country's hinterlands from the now-resurgent militants of both the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, the militants are likely to remain part of the fabric of Pashtun culture in the tribal lands on both sides of the mountainous border, where the governments of both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have proved unable to exert control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given this complexity, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are a seductive tool. They have delivered body blows to Al Qaeda's leadership in the tribal areas of northern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without risking a single American soldier on the ground. And last week, Mr. Obama was reported to be considering widening their use to include killing Taliban leaders who direct insurgents in Afghanistan from other sanctuaries, near Quetta, in southwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, recently called the spy agency's campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the ''most effective weapon'' available to the Obama administration to take on militants there -- a finely tuned bit of praise, given the Pakistani government's past denunciations of forays by American ground troops onto Pakistani soil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign is, at the same time, the antithesis of the grinding, patient and high-risk counterinsurgency doctrine currently in vogue at the Pentagon. Following the pattern of Iraq, that doctrine's proponents want to persuade at least some tribal groups to  work with the Americans, as well as with the Afghan and Pakistani governments, rather than the Taliban and Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, some C.I.A. veterans of the tribal battles worry that instead of separating the citizenry from the militants the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be uniting them. These experts say they fear that killing militants from the sky won't  undermine, and may promote, the psychology of anti-American militancy that is metastasizing in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Unless we come up with a coherent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, then nothing works,'' said Milton Bearden, who as C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad once led the agency's campaign to arm Afghan mujahedeen against the Soviet Union. (It was Mr. Bearden who learned, from an executive at Lipton's parent company, Unilever, that Lipton tea wasn't selling well in some parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and why.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the last six months, C.I.A. operatives wielding joysticks have launched more than three dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Predator and more heavily-armed Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Missiles fired from them have hit militants gathering in mountain redoubts, and they have hit truck convoys ferrying ammunition across the border into Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some agency veterans draw comparisons to the Israeli policy of ''targeted killings'' of Hamas leaders -- killings that claimed scores of the group's top operatives in the Palestinian territories, but didn't keep new recruits from attacking Israel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence officials in Washington and Islamabad said it was nearly impossible to measure the impact of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the so-called ''war of ideas.'' Even when  precise, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often kill women and children in militant compounds. When that happens, local Pashtun customs of ''badal'' obligate their survivors to seek revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then there is the matter of bravery. For his new book about the rise of robot warfare, ''Wired for War,''  P. W. Singer interviewed insurgents in the Muslim world who said that America's reliance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weapons is a sign that the United States is afraid to sacrifice troops in combat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This ought to be a particular concern now, Mr. Singer said, as the United States struggles to build alliances in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. There, he said, trust is built by displays of personal bravery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If courage is the coin of the realm, then courage is what proves to the local Pashtun tribes that you are their allies,'' he said. He cited the protest song, which he came across while researching his book. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States learned hard lessons in Iraq about the limits of technology. The march to Baghdad made good on the Bush administration's promises of a swift victory over Iraq's army. But after the Iraqi troop columns melted into the landscape, the war turned nasty, brutish and long. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, there seems to be no chance that President Obama will order an invasion of western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and some experts see the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as only  the best of many bad options. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seth Jones, an analyst at the RAND Corporation and author of a forthcoming book about Afghanistan, ''In the Graveyard of Empires,'' acknowledges a possibility that expanded missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at Taliban leaders across the border in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, could affect the fight in Afghanistan. They may demoralize Taliban foot soldiers there and weaken them in the eyes of fence-sitting Afghans who are waiting to see which side will win. If those Afghans come to think the Taliban can no longer return to Kabul, the foot soldiers might even be driven to the negotiating table, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is different, Mr. Jones said. In the northwest, where Al Qaeda's leaders are now based, he  sees little hope that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone  can address the core problem, which he says is a militancy already strong among local residents. So continued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there,  he said, may mean only more trouble and instability for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You don't clear territory, you don't hold territory, and you don't undermine Al Qaeda's support base with Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Members of Mr.  Obama's team, like their predecessors in the Bush administration, say they know this. It's just that everyone is struggling to come up with a better plan for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, summed it up in recent testimony to the Senate, with more than a hint of frustration in his voice: ''No one I've talked to has come up with a grand strategy for that area.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After agreeing to bury their differences and unite forces, Taliban leaders based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have closed ranks with their Afghan comrades to ready a new offensive in Afghanistan as the United States prepares to send 17,000 more troops there this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews, several Taliban fighters based in the border region said preparations for the anticipated influx of American troops were already being made. A number of new, younger commanders have been preparing to step up a campaign of roadside bombings and suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to greet the Americans, the fighters said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The refortified alliance was forged after the reclusive Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, sent emissaries to persuade Pakistani Taliban leaders to join forces and turn their attention to Afghanistan, Pakistani officials and Taliban members said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The overture by Mullah Omar is an indication that with the prospect of an American buildup, the Taliban feel the need to strengthen their own forces in Afghanistan and to redirect their Pakistani allies toward blunting the new American push.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban, an offspring of the Afghan Taliban, are led by veterans of the fighting in Afghanistan who come from the border regions. They have always supported the fight against foreign forces in Afghanistan by supplying fighters, training and logistical aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in recent years the Pakistani Taliban have concentrated on battling the Pakistani government, extending a domain that has not only threatened </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but has also provided an essential rear base for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, American officials told The New York Times this week that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military intelligence agency continued to offer money, supplies and guidance to the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan as a proxy to help shape a friendly government there once American forces leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new Taliban alliance has raised concern in Afghanistan, where NATO generals warn that the conflict will worsen this year. It has also generated anxiety in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where officials fear that a united Taliban will be more dangerous, even if focused on Afghanistan, and draw more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This may bring some respite for us from militants' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but what it may entail in terms of national security could be far more serious,'' said one senior Pakistani official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not permitted to talk to news organizations. ''This would mean more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside our tribal areas, something we have been arguing against with the Americans.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban is dominated by three powerful commanders -- Baitullah Mehsud, Hafiz Gul Bahadur and Maulavi Nazir -- based in North and South Waziristan, the hub of insurgent activity in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal border regions, who have often clashed among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mullah Omar dispatched a six-member team to Waziristan in late December and early January, several Taliban fighters said in interviews in Dera Ismail Khan, a town in  North-West Frontier Province that is not far from South Waziristan. The Afghan Taliban delegation urged the Pakistani Taliban leaders to settle their internal differences, scale down their activities in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and help counter the planned increase of American forces in Afghanistan, the fighters said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three Pakistani Taliban leaders agreed. In February, they formed a united council, or shura, called the Council of United Mujahedeen. In a printed statement the leaders vowed to put aside their disputes and focus on fighting American-led forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, denied that the meetings ever took place or that any emissaries were sent by Mullah Omar. The Afghan Taliban routinely disavow any presence in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or connection to the Pakistani Taliban to emphasize that their movement is indigenous to Afghanistan.  ''We don't like to be involved with them, as we have rejected all affiliation with Pakistani Taliban fighters,'' Mr. Mujahid said. ''We have sympathy for them as Muslims, but beside that, there is nothing else between us.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several Pakistani officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to talk to news organizations, confirmed the meetings. But they said that the overture might have been inspired by Sirajuddin Haqqani, an Afghan Taliban leader who swears allegiance to Mullah Omar but is largely independent in his operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Haqqani, and his father Jalaluddin Haqqani, the most powerful figures in Waziristan, are closely linked to Al Qaeda and to Pakistani intelligence, American officials say. From their base in North Waziristan, they have directed groups of fighters into eastern Afghanistan and increasingly in complex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Afghan capital, Kabul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban fighters said the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by Mullah Abdullah Zakir, a commander from Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, whose real name is reported to be Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A front-line commander during the Taliban government, Mullah Zakir was captured in 2001 in northern Afghanistan and was detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until his release in 2007, Afghan Taliban members contacted by telephone said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani fighters described Mullah Zakir as an impressive speaker and a trainer, and one said he was particularly energetic in working to unite the different Taliban groups. Beyond bolstering Taliban forces in Afghanistan, both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban leaders had other reasons to unite, Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One motivation may have been to shift the focus of hostilities to Afghanistan in hopes of improving their own security in Waziristan, where more than 30 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent months have been directed at both Mr. Mehsud and Mr. Nazir. Two senior commanders of the Haqqani network have been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban leaders also rely on Mr. Haqqani and their affiliation with the Afghan mujahedeen for legitimacy, as well as the money and influence it brings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In their written statement, decorated with crossed swords, the three Pakistani Taliban leaders reaffirmed their allegiance to Mullah Omar, as well as the leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mujahedeen should unite as the ''enemies'' have united behind the leadership of President Obama, it said. ''The mujahedeen should put aside their own differences for the sake of God, God's happiness, for the strength of religion, and to bring dishonor on the infidels.'' The Taliban fighters interviewed said that the top commanders removed a number of older commanders and appointed younger commanders who were good fighters to prepare for operations in Afghanistan in the coming weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In confident spirits, the Taliban fighters predicted that 2009 was going to be a ''very bloody'' year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber attacked a crowded mosque in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday, setting off explosives as a cleric intoned the holy prayers, bringing the roof crashing down and killing scores of people in what was the bloodiest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was unleashed in an area where there has been intense activity by Pakistani security forces aimed at protecting the critical Khyber Pass supply route for American forces in Afghanistan. Occurring only hours before President Obamaunveiled a new strategy against militants in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it raised questions about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ability to counter the threat from Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Estimates of the death toll swung wildly as survivors in long robes and white skullcaps scrabbled frantically in the debris to recover the dead and rescue the wounded. A minaret with a loudspeaker poked from the rubble. One local official said 37 people had died, but most accounts put the death toll at around 50. Hours after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack, Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> television stations reported that up to 70 people might have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber mingled with worshipers, according to survivors and residents, as the Friday Prayer session reached its climax with a communal prayer. Residents said that about 250 to 300 people had been praying in the mosque at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One survivor named Arman said that a cleric had begun to intone ''God is great'' just as the blast occurred. ''There were blood and limbs all around,'' he said. ''I had never seen such a horrendous scene in my whole life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mosque was about 12 miles from the city of Peshawar on the main highway between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The blast brought the roof of the two-story building tumbling onto the first floor ceiling, which collapsed, residents said. Within hours, Tariq Hayat, the chief administrator of the region close to the Afghanistan border, told Geo TV that ''so far we have counted 48 bodies.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bombing came as Mr. Obama prepared to announce his new strategy to bolster American forces in Afghanistan and for the first time set benchmarks for progress in fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban in both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It also coincided with reports of a new alliance between the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban intended to counter America's plan to send an extra 21,000 troops to the battle against the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increases will bring the overall American deployment in Afghanistan to about 60,000. The Times of London reported on Friday that Britain was considering sending 2,000 soldiers to support the American reinforcement, in addition to the 8,300 troops it already has in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hayat, the Khyber administrator, blamed Tehrik-i-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a militant group headed by Baitullah Mehsud that is battling the Pakistani Army in increasingly large swaths of the country. Its training camps have recently been attacked by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Their aim is to spread terror, and anyplace where they cause maximum casualties is a legitimate target for them,'' Mr. Hayat said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud is a leading figure in the Pakistani Taliban, which consists of fighters who come from the border regions and are led by veterans of the fighting in Afghanistan. They have supported the fight against foreign forces in Afghanistan by supplying fighters, training and logistical aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in recent years the Pakistani Taliban have concentrated on battling the Pakistani government, extending a domain that has not only threatened </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but also provided an essential rear base for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, American officials told The New York Times this week that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military intelligence agency continued to offer money, supplies and guidance to the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan as a proxy to help shape a friendly government there once American forces left. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Khyber area is known for bitter feuds among rival tribes and groups of militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dozens of bodies were taken to a hospital in the neighboring town of Jamrud, while relatives removed others for burial, residents said. Many of the dead were civilians, including children, residents reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the dead were 10 police officers and four paramilitary soldiers from a nearby checkpoint, but Mr. Hayat denied they could have been the target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the 158 wounded were brought to the main hospitals in Peshawar. A doctor at one of the hospitals said that they had declared an emergency to deal with the high number of casualties. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to a joint session of Parliament, President Asif Ali Zardari promised Saturday to ease domestic political turmoil and praised the Obama administration's new policy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as ''positive change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a conciliatory gesture to the opposition party, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N, Mr. Zardari said that he would lift the executive rule he had imposed on Punjab Province, the most populous province in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and one where the opposition party holds the most seats in the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The announcement by Mr. Zardari was seen as another major concession after the opposition party led huge street demonstrations, forcing the president to agree to the restoration of the chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been removed from the bench in 2007.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In phrases that were most likely intended to please Washington, Mr. Zardari said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needed to ''root out extremism and militancy.'' He welcomed the new package of $7.5 billion for civilian assistance over five years formally announced by President Obama on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increased American aid showed that Washington agreed with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the best way to fight extremism was through alleviating poverty, Mr. Zardari said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is an endorsement of our call for economic and social uplift as a means to fight extremism,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was in implicit contrast to the eight years of rule by Pervez Musharraf, a former general, when almost all of the $10 billion in American assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went to the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he has in the past, Mr. Zardari stressed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needed to fight the escalating extremism for its own good, a way of deflecting vocal Pakistani critics of the alliance with the United States. Mr. Zardari as much as said the fight against the militants was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fight, not America's fight. ''We are fighting militancy and extremism for our own sake,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately on Saturday, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan commended the Obama administration's strategic review, saying it matched the aspirations of the Afghan people and the views of his own government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is exactly what the Afghan people were hoping for,'' Mr. Karzai told reporters at a news briefing in the presidential palace in Kabul. ''It has our full support and backing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In particular, Mr. Karzai said he was happy to see Mr. Obama's recognition that Al Qaeda and its allies were still in the region and had their bases and sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. The Afghan president has been protesting for several years that the battle is fought in Afghan villages while the insurgents' headquarters, bases and training camps in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are left untouched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The sanctuaries of the terrorists, the nest of the terrorists and the training places of the terrorists are not in Afghanistan; it has a regional dimension,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A major point of Mr. Obama's new policy toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was his declaration that the United States wanted to ensure that the havens established by Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the tribal areas were eliminated. It was from these havens, he said, that Al Qaeda was plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari did not mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda by name and did not address the power of the militants in the tribal areas or in other areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Rather, he chose to make a stand about the territorial integrity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and reinforced the notion that the government would not tolerate a breach of that sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The sovereignty of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be protected at all costs,'' he said. ''It will be.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The insistence of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that no American or other foreign troops can operate from its territory is one of the basic challenges facing the Obama administration as it tries to find a way to eliminate the militant threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, the United States' special envoy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, said ''the red line is unambiguous and stated publicly by the Pakistani government: No foreign troops on our soil.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because of that prohibition and the unsteady effort by the Pakistani Army against the militants, Washington has been deploying remotely piloted aircraft, known as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> armed with missiles against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas. The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are extremely unpopular in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and have served to strengthen the anti-American sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari, whose popularity has plummeted in recent months, in part because he is linked by many Pakistanis to American policy, did not mention the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But President Obama hinted strongly Friday that they would continue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out Al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders,'' he said. ''And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or the other -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his announcement that he would withdraw the executive rule in Punjab that he imposed last month, Mr. Zardari was effectively handing the province back to rule of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N. Mr. Zardari is co-chairman of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party, a mantle he inherited from his wife, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his speech, he said his party would support the candidate of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N as chief minister, a job held by Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the leader of the league, Nawaz Sharif, before executive rule was imposed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere, dozens of suspected militants fired rockets early Saturday at a transport terminal in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near Peshawar, the police told The Associated Press. The terminal is used to ship supplies to NATO troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed by a day a suicide bomber's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which killed about 40 people, at a crowded mosque about 12 miles from Peshawar on the main highway to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- The Supreme Court overturned Tuesday an order barring one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most powerful politicians from holding office, allowing Shahbaz Sharif to return to his post as chief minister of Punjab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A five-member bench of the court appointed by the newly restored chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, suspended a ruling made in February that was widely interpreted as a political maneuver to bar President Asif Ali Zardari's political opponents, Mr. Sharif and his brother, Nawaz, from challenging him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Supreme Court did not rule on the future of Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader who twice served as prime minister, political commentators said they expected the court to do so soon and clear the way for him to run for election in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling on Tuesday came a day after militants assaulted a police academy outside the Punjab capital, Lahore, leading to a daylong siege that left eight police recruits, an instructor and four of the attackers dead. It was the second terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Punjab in March, following an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Sri Lankan cricket team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on Monday, Shahbaz Sharif said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have been mitigated -- or avoided -- if the provincial officials had been paying attention to security matters instead of the political machinations resulting from the Supreme Court ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Shahbaz Sharif was lamenting the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police academy, the head of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, told Western news agencies that his men had carried out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview with Reuters, Mr. Mehsud said he was proud to take responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and was planning more. ''We wholeheartedly take responsibility for this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and will carry out more such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the future,'' Mr. Mehsud said, according to the Reuters account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's revenge for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said. Without any further elaboration, he also claimed to be planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has used aircraft known as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that are armed with missiles to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at militants from Al Qaeda, and more recently at Mr. Mehsud's training camps in the tribal areas in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> northwest, along the border with Afghanistan. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed at least nine senior leaders of Al Qaeda, according to senior American military officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehsud leads the Tehrik-e-Taliban, an alliance of Taliban groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is supported by Al Qaeda and in turn provides sanctuary for Al Qaeda in the Waziristan area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United States intelligence official cast doubt on Mr. Mehsud's claim. ''It's far from certain that his group was responsible for this,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing classified intelligence assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official recounted that Mr. Mehsud had made boastful claims in the past about attacking the United States, and Washington, in particular, even though terrorism analysts do not believe his group has the ability to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American counterterrorism and intelligence analysts were still sorting out who was responsible for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police academy. ''I don't think we have a judgment on this yet,'' said the American official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the assault on the police training center near Lahore, the senior official in the Interior Ministry, Rehman Malik, spoke out more forcefully than he had before about the threat of the Taliban to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are two choices: to either let the Taliban take over your country or to fight it out,'' he said. ''At this time the nation must be united and show its unity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement outside his house in Lahore, Shahbaz Sharif said that once he returned to his duties as Punjab's chief minister, he would ''leave no stone unturned'' to help his constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been out of power since Feb. 26, after the Supreme Court ruling barred the Sharif brothers from seeking or holding office because of prior criminal convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zardari then imposed executive rule on the province, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous, essentially controlling it through his ally, Gov. Salman Taseer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most notorious militants claimed responsibility in a series of phone calls with news organizations on Tuesday for a brazen armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a police academy here that killed at least eight police officers and wounded more than 100 others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We wholeheartedly take responsibility for this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and will carry out more such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in future,'' a main  leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, told Reuters, saying that it was prompted by the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his forces the United States has been carrying out by unmanned aerial vehicles in the border  region near Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's revenge for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Mehsud said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Interior Ministry spokesman, Raashid Bashir Mazari, said Tuesday an investigation was under way into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but that it was too early to respond to Mr. Mehsud's claim, Reuters reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud is a suspect  in a string of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. He is  also suspected of sending fighters across the border into Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Starting in February, the United States has widened its assault on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based militants, striking at  militant training camps run by Mr. Mehsud. Last week, American authorities announced a $5 million reward for information that could lead to his location or capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, the attackers hopped over a crumbling brick wall, wearing backpacks and belts with dangling grenades. They were young and wore beards, and by 7:30 a.m. on Monday, they were firing automatic weapons machine guns into an unarmed crowd of young police recruits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the second time this month that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous province, Punjab, had come under assault by militants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attackers issued no demands but went on a rampage, killing at least eight recruits and instructors. One attacker was killed in the siege that followed and, in a gory finale, three detonated suicide belts, killing themselves. More than 100 people were wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They were barbaric,'' a senior trainer at the center said. ''They had no demands. We didn't understand what they wanted. They just kept killing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a nuclear-armed state, has been mired in political wrangling since an election last year, with leaders fighting each other instead of joining efforts against the insurgency, which is slowly strangling the country. The government's impotence will greatly complicate the Obama administration's efforts to bring order to Afghanistan, whose militants slip through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> porous borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rehman Malik, a senior adviser in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Ministry, said there were seven assailants. Three were arrested, he said, and four died in the siege. They rented an apartment in Lahore but came from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas in the west, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking on Monday, before Mr. Mehsud's claim of responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Malik said: ''In our country, at our different borders, arms are coming in, Stinger missiles are coming in, rocket launchers are coming in, heavy equipment is coming; it should be stopped. Whoever the antistate elements are, they are destabilizing the country.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the immediate wake of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it had seemed just as likely that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been perpetrated by Punjabi militant groups, like Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was blamed for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year in Mumbai, India, or Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a sectarian group that recruits in southern Punjab but in recent years moved to the tribal areas to train alongside Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mushtaq Sukhera, the deputy inspector general of investigations with the Punjab police, said that it was impossible to tell the identities of the attackers, and that they could be from a Punjab-based group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lashkar-e-Taiba was suspected in a similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this month, on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore. About a dozen attackers escaped, humiliating Pakistani authorities who seemed powerless to stop an assault on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most cherished pastime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This time, elite police commandos struck back quickly, surrounding the police academy and fiercely attacking the militants. ''We encircled them,'' said Shahid Iqbal, deputy inspector general of operations for the Lahore Police Department, as a crowd of police officers in the background cheered ''God is great'' and ''Long live Punjab police.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Iqbal said, ''We engaged them in the stairwells.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The elite forces recaptured the academy by 4 p.m., after an eight-hour siege. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani praised the security forces for what amounted to a relative success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some at the police academy believed that the attackers had come from Afghanistan, or at least were Pashtun, an ethnicity indigenous to tribal areas in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Afghans,'' Mr. Iqbal said, flicking his wrist in a gesture of distaste. When asked what his forces found at the end of the siege, he replied: ''Three bodies. Two heads.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many young recruits saw the attackers -- who burst upon them during a recess from the drill, firing indiscriminately into a crowd of more than 700 men -- and not everybody agreed they were Afghan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tajamul Hussein, a recruit who was part of the drill, said the attackers spoke Saraiki, a dialect of Punjabi, the local language here. He said one attacker had a very long beard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said they were shouting, ''Oh, Red Mosque attackers, we have come,'' a reference to the 2007 takeover by Pakistani authorities of a militant mosque in Islamabad, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Monday's siege was much shorter, but terrifying for the recruits inside, most of them no older than 20, and from small provincial towns with few job options. For them the Manawan center, one of six basic training centers in the province, is a path to social advancement, despite its decay, and lack of running water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adnan Ali woke with a start when bullets pierced the glass in a window near his bed. When a grenade was lobbed through a different pane, he backed away, seeing a scene of panic through the dirty glass in the parade yard just outside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They were lying on the ground and crawling,'' he said. ''They were shouting, 'Run, run!' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Muhammad Shafik, a cadet, said he was paralyzed by fear. ''They started hitting people,'' he said, standing in a warehouselike room that served as sleeping quarters, with hundreds of thin mattresses spread in rumpled lines on a concrete floor. ''When their magazine was finished, they loaded another one and kept firing.'' He added, ''My mind was moving slower than my body.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police brought out the wounded in blue-and-gray armored personnel carriers, which the militants tried to hit with grenades from a third-floor balcony. Elite police officers returned ferocious fire each time, making a frightening din that punctuated the afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Signs of struggle were everywhere. Bullet holes had punctured green screens in upstairs windows. Broken glass crunched underfoot on stairways. A pool of blood, thickening, traced the shape of a human body on a speckled stone floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police who came to the rescue were led by an elite contingent of Punjab police officers set up in 1997 as the rough equivalent of police SWAT teams in the United States, said the former inspector general of the Punjab police, Shaukat Javed. Now there are about 5,500 members, with units of 50 to 60 members based in each district of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Javed said the police academy that was attacked was the least guarded of three training centers in the Lahore area. One of the facility's trainers said that out of about 30 security guards at the complex -- retired military officers with old rifles and little ammunition -- just 7 were on duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One, named Mustafa, fought very bravely, several instructors said. The instructors on stage in front of the parade were armed only with sticks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What can you do with sticks?'' Mr. Shafik asked, his face set in bewilderment and pain from the loss of a favorite teacher, Gulam Mohiuddin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attackers had more sophisticated weaponry than in past </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Mr. Sukhera, the police official. A factory-made antipersonnel explosive that bore the markings Claymore Mark 5 was found near one of the dead attackers in a plastic box, said Zulifkar Hameed, an elite force member who was among the first inside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The elite forces ultimately prevailed. But the attackers, in some respects, got their way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not joining the police,'' said an angry young recruit, Khalil Zaman. ''I love my life. No one wants to be here anymore. We're taking off our uniforms and going home.''</SPAN></P>

It was the second terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Punjab in March, following an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Sri Lankan cricket team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview on Monday, Shahbaz Sharif said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have been mitigated -- or avoided -- if the provincial officials had been paying attention to security matters instead of the political machinations resulting from the Supreme Court ruling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Shahbaz Sharif was lamenting the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police academy, the head of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, told Western news agencies that his men had carried out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a telephone interview with Reuters, Mr. Mehsud said he was proud to take responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and was planning more. ''We wholeheartedly take responsibility for this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and will carry out more such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the future,'' Mr. Mehsud said, according to the Reuters account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's revenge for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said. Without any further elaboration, he also claimed to be planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has used aircraft known as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that are armed with missiles to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at militants from Al Qaeda, and more recently at Mr. Mehsud's training camps in the tribal areas in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> northwest, along the border with Afghanistan. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed at least nine senior leaders of Al Qaeda, according to senior American military officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud leads the Tehrik-e-Taliban, an alliance of Taliban groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is supported by Al Qaeda and in turn provides sanctuary for Al Qaeda in the Waziristan area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A United States intelligence official cast doubt on Mr. Mehsud's claim. ''It's far from certain that his group was responsible for this,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity  because he was discussing classified intelligence assessments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official recounted that Mr. Mehsud had made boastful claims in the past about attacking the United States, and Washington, in particular, even though terrorism analysts do not believe his group has the ability to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American counterterrorism and intelligence analysts were still sorting out who was responsible for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the police academy. ''I don't think we have a judgment on this yet,'' said the American official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the assault on the police training center near Lahore, the senior official in the Interior Ministry, Rehman Malik, spoke out more forcefully than he had before about the threat of the Taliban to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are two choices: to either let the Taliban take over your country or to fight it out,'' he said. ''At this time the nation must be united and show its unity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement outside his house in Lahore, Shahbaz Sharif said that once he returned to his duties as Punjab's chief minister, he would ''leave no stone unturned'' to help his constituents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has been out of power since Feb. 26, after the Supreme Court ruling barred the Sharif brothers from seeking or holding office because of prior criminal convictions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari then imposed executive rule on the province, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous, essentially controlling it through his ally, Gov. Salman Taseer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Criticizes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON -- An important Democratic senator expressed strong doubt on Tuesday about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ability to help the United States fight the war in Afghanistan, and signaled that he would not support United States aid until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders took on extremism within their own borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't have a lot of confidence in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being a solution to the problems in Afghanistan,'' said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, ''and they're likely to continue to be.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that so far </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had demonstrated no willingness to confront the violent forces in its own government. He questioned the effectiveness of billions of dollars in proposed aid from the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If I thought we could buy stability, I would buy it,'' he  said. ''I have no reluctance in purchasing stability if it's effective.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehsud escaped unhurt, the intelligence official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the first of its kind in the Orakzai region, which lies southwest of Peshawar and close to the border with Afghanistan, residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region is strategically important because it borders other areas in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> known for widespread Taliban activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mehsud is a prominent lieutenant of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, who claimed responsibility for an assault this week on police cadets in Lahore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We wholeheartedly take responsibility for this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and will carry out more such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the future,'' Baitullah Mehsud said Tuesday, according to Reuters.</SPAN></P>

Without elaborating, he also claimed to be planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hakimullah Mehsud is in charge of Taliban operations in three of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal regions in a belt of territory used by Al Qaeda and the Taliban as a rear base for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on NATO and American forces in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials also hold his forces responsible for attacking NATO depots in Peshawar used to resupply international forces in Afghanistan. His influence is such that he has imposed strict Islamic law in the Orakzai region, residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some accounts by Pakistani television stations said that 12 people had died in the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday. News reports from the area said Taliban militants had sealed off the target zone immediately after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani authorities frequently criticize the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty, and the Pakistani public resents the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the United States says they form a central part of its tactics to oppose the Taliban in the border area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CORRECTION APPENDED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO ENTER the office where Asif Ali Zardari, the president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, conducts his business, you head down a long corridor toward two wax statues of exceptionally tall soldiers, each in a long, white tunic with a glittering column of buttons. On closer inspection, these turn out to be actual humans who have been trained in the arts of immobility. The office they guard, though large, is not especially opulent or stupefying by the standards of such places. President Zardari met me just inside the doorway, then seated himself facing a widescreen TV displaying an image of fish swimming in a deep blue sea. His party spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, and his presidential spokesman, Farahnaz Ispahani, sat facing him, almost as rigid as the soldiers. Zardari is famous for straying off message and saying odd things or jumbling facts and figures. He is also famous for blaming his aides when things go wrong -- and things have been going wrong quite a lot lately. Zardari's aides didn't want him to talk to me. Now they were tensely waiting for a mishap.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president himself, natty in a navy suit, his black hair brilliantined to a sheen, was the very picture of ease. Zardari beamed when we talked about New York, where he often lived between 2004, when he was released from prison after eight years, and late 2007, when he returned to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not long after his wife, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated by terrorists. For all that painful recent history, Zardari is a suave and charming man with a sly grin, and he gives the impression of thoroughly enjoying what must be among the world's least desirable jobs. Zardari had just been through the most dangerous weeks of his six months in office. He dissolved the government in Punjab, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dominant state, and called out the police to stop the country's lawyers and leading opposition party from holding a ''long march'' to demand the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been sacked, along with most of the high judiciary, by Zardari's predecessor, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Zardari defused the situation only by allowing Chaudhry's return to office and giving in to other demands that he had previously and repeatedly rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, despite this spectacular reversal, the president was not in a remotely penitent state of mind over his handling of the protests against him. ''Whoever killed my wife was seeking the Balkanization of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he told me. ''There is a view that I saved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then'' -- by calling for calm at a perilous moment -- ''and there is a view that by making this decision I saved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> again.'' There had been, he said, a very real threat of a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the marchers on their way to Islamabad. That is why his government invoked a statute dating back to the British raj in order to authorize the police to arrest protesters and prevent the march from forming. I pointed out that Benazir Bhutto faced a far more specific threat and was outraged when General Musharraf kept her from speaking on the pretext of protecting her. The president didn't miss a beat. ''And therefore,'' he rejoined, ''we moved to the other side'': that is, he reversed his order to the police, and permitted the protesters' march, just before giving in to their demands altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari has a special talent for maneuvering himself out of the tight spots he gets himself into. But the Pakistani people have grown weary of his artful dodging. Zardari's poll numbers are dreadful. More important, he has given little sustained attention to the country's overwhelming problems -- including, of course, the Islamist extremism that, for the Obama administration, has made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quite possibly the most important, and worrisome, country in the world. Zardari has bought himself more time, but for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself, the clock is ticking louder and louder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I arrived in Islamabad on March 10, the long march was set to begin in two days and had come to feel like a storm gathering force at sea -- one that might peter out before it hit land or turn into a Category 4 hurricane. In a country where democracy feels as flimsy as a wooden shack, the foreboding was very real. ''Our condition is much more fragile than it was in the 1990s,'' Samina Ahmed, the International Crisis Group's longtime </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> analyst, told me. (The I.C.G. is a sponsor of the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, where I am the policy director.) The Taliban and other extremists had, she estimated, placed half the country beyond the control of security forces. The government had recently ceded control over the Swat Valley, 100 miles from the nation's capital, to the extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feels as if it's falling apart. Last fall the country barely avoided bankruptcy. The tribal areas, which border on Afghanistan, remain a vast Taliban sanctuary and redoubt. The giant province of Baluchistan, though far more accessible, is racked by a Baluchi separatist rebellion, while American officials view Quetta, Baluchistan's capital, as Taliban HQ. American policy has arguably made the situation even worse, for the Predator-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along the border, though effective, drive the Taliban eastward, deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And the strategy has been only reinforcing hostility to the United States among ordinary Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made itself the supreme conundrum of American foreign policy. During the campaign, Obama often said that the heart of the terrorist threat was not Iraq but Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and once in office he had senior policy makers undertake an array of reviews designed to coordinate policy in the region. They seem to have narrowed the target area even further, to the Pakistani frontier. ''For the American people,'' Obama announced on March 27, ''this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.'' Some officials see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a volcano that, should it blow, would send an inconceivable amount of poisonous ash raining down on the world around it. David Kilcullen, a key adviser to Gen. David Petraeus, the Centcom commander, recently asserted that ''within one to six months we could see the collapse of the Pakistani state,'' a calamity that, given the country's size, strategic location and nuclear stockpile, would ''dwarf'' all other current crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And amid all that, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president appeared to be playing with fire. Zardari was setting his security forces on peaceful demonstrators, just as his authoritarian predecessor, General Musharraf, did -- against members of Zardari's own political party -- several years earlier. The government crackdown, designed to prevent the marchers from reaching the capital, began on March 11. The police swept through the homes of opposition-party leaders, lawmakers, activists, ''miscreants'' and ordinary party workers. Many leading officials were already underground, but hundreds of arrests were made. By the 12th, the first day of the march, much of the country was glued to the television, where swarms of heavily armed policemen could be seen knocking down protesters and dragging them off to the paddy wagons. Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the main opposition party, saw the protests as the ''prelude to a revolution,'' while Rehman Malik, a key Zardari adviser, accused Sharif of ''sedition.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The posturing and hyperbole would have been comical if the stakes weren't so high. Although in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it's true, the stakes always feel high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been living through a dangerous and thrilling era of popular agitation and spasmodic crackdown. In March 2007, General Musharraf made the colossal miscalculation of insisting that Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, whose activism on the bench had threatened the military's invulnerability to legal prosecution, step down. In decades past, judges quietly acceded under such duress, and Musharraf may be excused for calculating that Chaudhry, an unassuming figure, would do likewise. Instead, the chief justice stood up to the president, who then fired him, creating a national hero of resistance. Tens of thousands of people lined the roads and cheered as Chaudhry barnstormed across the country -- an astonishing sign of Pakistanis' craving, after years of repression, for democracy and the liberal principles established in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That October, under intense domestic and American pressure, Mu/sharraf agreed to permit Benazir Bhutto, who had been living in Dubai, to return. Bhutto and her chief rival, Nawaz Sharif, had been exiled from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since their respective terms as prime minister. But their political parties -- Sharif's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Bhutto's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party (PPP) -- continued to operate under Musharraf, and their partisans waited for the return of their leaders to revive the nation's democratic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO MONTHS AFTER HER ARRIVAL, Bhutto was killed in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Rawalpindi. Her death was experienced as a national calamity -- both a terrifying proof of the growing reach of terrorism inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a grave blow to the country's democratic hopes. Three days later, the PPP -- an arm of the Bhutto family since its founding by her father 40 years earlier -- chose her widower, Zardari, and their 19-year-old son as co-chairmen, the elder acting in effect as regent for the younger. In elections seven weeks later, the PPP, buoyed by sympathy over Bhutto's death and vowing to take up the cause of the deposed judges, won. It formed a coalition government that included regional allies and Sharif's PML-N. Here, at last, was a chance for a new beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2006, Bhutto and Sharif met in London to sign a document known as the Charter of Democracy. The two vowed to rescind a raft of amendments that military rulers had added to the Constitution, including several that empowered the president at the expense of the prime minister, and to establish a merit-based system for picking judges (a practice neither Bhutto nor Sharif even remotely favored while in office). But Zardari seemed much less interested in these constitutional questions than Sharif, who made the restitution of judges a centerpiece of his campaign. (He compelled all of his party's parliamentary candidates to swear an oath before him demanding that the judges be restored.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2008, less than three months after the government was formed, Sharif pulled his ministers from the cabinet. But he continued pressing Zardari to abide by the spirit of the Charter of Democracy. On Aug. 7, Zardari signed a document pledging that a ''nonpartisan'' figure would assume the presidency and that this person would restore the judges shortly after taking office. When it became clear, in late August, that Zardari himself would become president, an irate Sharif withdrew from the coalition altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 9, Zardari became president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and proceeded to ignore his promise to restore the judges. I asked Zardari how he could have done so. He explained that since General Musharraf had agreed to resign rather than face impeachment proceedings, ''everybody goes back to start fresh.'' Apparently this was, in Zardari's mind, a special kind of pact that ceased to be binding when one party concluded that the circumstances under which it had been accepted had changed. Zar/dari kept nibbling away at this perplexing concept. The document he had signed was ''an agreement by consent,'' not ''an agreement by law.'' It was like a marriage. It was like a merger. I said that I wondered if Sharif would agree; he may well have thought that Zardari had, in fact, bound himself to act with dispatch. ''Maybe that might be the interpretation assumed by him,'' the president conceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari did win a partial victory: he persuaded 57 of the remaining 63 High Court judges to take a new oath in order to be restored to office. But the other six, including Chaudhry, refused to do so, on the grounds that, as they had been unconstitutionally deprived of office, the oaths they swore earlier remained in force. Early this year, the lawyers began planning their march, which was to terminate with a sit-in in Islamabad. The government would be able to dismiss a sit-in among lawyers as a nuisance; only with the active involvement of the PML-N, with its vast rank and file and its control over the Punjab state apparatus, would the protest truly pose a threat to Zardari. In mid-February, the PML-N agreed to join the lawyers not only for the planned march but also for the sit-in, which held far greater potential for confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days later, on Feb. 25, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar -- whom Musharraf had elevated to replace Chaudhry, and whom Zardari had consistently supported (rumors abound of late-night conversations between them in the president's house) -- abruptly issued a decision on a case that had been pending for eight months, finding that Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz, the chief minister of Punjab, could not hold elective office because they had previously been convicted of crimes. It was widely assumed that Zardari engineered this outcome to end PML-N control over Punjab. That very evening he gave substance to these suspicions by suspending Punjab's elected government in favor of rule by the governor, a federal appointee. This combination of moves had the appearance of a coup. It caused outrage in the Punjab, in the ranks of the PML-N and throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked Zardari why he had imposed governor's rule, he embarked on another adventure in logic. ''No democratic party would like to do governor's rule,'' he said. ''It's in the Constitution; it's part of necessity. The government advised me to put governor's rule, and I took their advice, as I am bound by the Constitution to accept the advice from the government.'' The official line is that, with the local government dissolved and no single party in the majority and thus able to form a new government, Islamabad had to step in. In fact, in such situations the Constitution requires the governor to ask the largest party to seek to form a majority -- as the PML-N surely would have done -- although the president does have the right to impose governor's rule if he judges the province to be unstable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari is, as all acknowledge, a very shrewd operator, but he seems to have little feel for public opinion: by overturning the Punjab government, he had sown a whirlwind. One leader of the planned march pointed out to me that the government could have completely taken the breeze out of the lawyers' sails by pushing the Supreme Court to decide in favor of the Sharifs rather than against them; such an act might well have made Chaudhry's restoration seem unnecessary. But Zardari, who traffics heavily in metaphors of combat, seems to prefer either guile or trials of strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari's critics were divided over the wisdom of the planned march and sit-in. ''Zardari is not the issue,'' Samina Ahmed told me. ''It's the institutions and processes that matter a lot. If the government is to be replaced, it has to be replaced by the people, who vote for a new government.'' No democratic government in the history of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been replaced by an orderly transition through a regularly scheduled election; Ahmed said she believed that democracy would never truly take hold until such transitions became the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others said that Zardari was very much the problem -- that he was himself the chief obstacle to democratic change. Nasim Zehra, a journalist who runs the current-affairs bureau of Dunya News, a new, private Urdu-language TV station, viewed Zardari as every bit as willing to manipulate the Constitution as Musharraf had been. The real problem, she said, ''is the culture of the exercise of power.'' The only way to change this culture was from the outside. In her view, a new ''Pakistani narrative'' arose with the lawyers movement of 2007 -- the narrative of ''movement politics'' rather than party politics, a grass-roots movement of the street, buoyed by the growth of new media, which demands systemic change rather than yet another partisan shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUESTION, AT BOTTOM, is not, Why is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such a mess? but, Why is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still such a mess? After all, in the 1960s, Ayub Khan, the country's generalissimo-philosopher, was celebrated, along with Park Chung-hee of South Korea and Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan, as the very type of the market-oriented autocrat third-world nations were said to need if they were to pull themselves out of poverty. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was favorably contrasted with India: a socialist democracy with a carnivalesque political scene, an asphyxiating bureaucracy and a ''Hindu rate of growth'' apparently fixed at 3 percent of G.D.P. Of course, that was then. Only more recently has it become clear that India's democracy allowed the country's innumerable religious, ethnic, caste and language groups to find places for themselves through the ballot and to build an economy as freewheeling as its politics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, meanwhile, has stagnated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Histories of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often point to the original sin of its founding in 1947. The very word ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' was an artifice, coined mainly from the first letters of the provinces that Muslim leaders in India had dreamed of forging into a separate Muslim state. ''India's Muslims demanded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without really knowing the results of that demand,'' wrote Husain Haqqani in ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Between Mosque and Military.'' (Haqqani is now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United States.) And when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hero-founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, died one year after independence, and his chief lieutenant, Liaquat Ali Khan, was assassinated three years later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leadership fell to bureaucrats and soldiers. Neither held democracy in high regard. This new establishment did have a clear idea of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identity: it was a refuge for South Asian Muslims from an India bent on subsuming the new country back into the ''Hindu raj.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> understood itself, and organized itself, as a national-security state with strong cold-war ties to the United States. Ayub Khan put an end to civilian government with a military coup in 1958. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identity and ideology were to be dictated from the top down, without the bother of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army remained firmly in control of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> destinies for 30 years, with an interval for the turbulent era of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who inherited power from an army discredited by its inept handling of the 1971 war with the breakaway province of East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (which then became Bangladesh). Several years earlier, Bhutto founded the PPP, whose slogan was simplicity itself -- ''Roti, Kapra aur Makan'' -- ''Bread, Clothing and Shelter.'' The mere act of speaking directly to the aspirations of ordinary citizens constituted a radical challenge to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> model of ''guided development.'' The fact that this worldly, witty scion of an old, wealthy Sindhi landowning family was himself a charter member of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> establishment made his challenge to the system all the more electrifying, and dangerous. The military, and indeed much of official Washington, viewed Bhutto as a dangerous rabble-rouser;/ he was overthrown in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bhutto's army chief of staff, Zia ul-Haq, not only deposed the prime minister but had him tried and executed two years later on a trumped-up charge. Zia crushed all opposition and introduced into the country's public life, especially into the military, a quite new element of austere and evangelical piety. Previous rulers, themselves religiously moderate, found Islam convenient, in much the same way that they found India convenient. Zia, a true believer, empowered religious societies and political parties in a bid to foster a new national ideology. His tenure coincided with the C.I.A.'s war on the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; Zia's military and intelligence officials were the ones who controlled the Afghan mujahedeen, doled out their American funds and sometimes came to share their worldview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time of Zia's death in a plane crash in 1988, his harsh reign was coming unglued in the face of a democratic challenge led by Bhutto's daughter, Benazir. A new era began in which all the forces born over the previous four decades contended for supremacy: the military sense of right and obligation to rule; populist and democratic politics; Islamic mobilization; and, increasingly, blatant, rampant corruption. Bhutto was twice elected prime minister, and she was twice removed by the country's president, acting at the behest of the military, ''for corruption and incompetence.'' The chief source of corruption, according to many analysts, was her husband. Zardari was jailed on a series of charges -- none of which he was ultimately convicted of -- from 1990 until Bhutto returned to power in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each time Bhutto fell, a new election was held, and she was replaced by Nawaz Sharif, a protege of General Zia and a voice for the citizens of Punjab, as well as for those uncomfortable with the ''liberalism'' -- or secularism -- of the PPP. Like Benazir Bhutto, Sharif ruled with the sufferance of the military and the intelligence apparatus. And like her, he ultimately fell afoul of his overseers. The era of democratic rule came to a crashing end in 1999, when General Musharraf led yet another coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GENERALS HAD CREATED a self-fulfilling prophecy: by infantilizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> democracy, they proved that civilians were unfit to rule. Indeed, as Zardari sagely observed in our conversation: ''If you look at your own history, American history, and then you see, How does democracy become the best formula of the world to govern? Democracy becomes the best formula of the world because it learns from its mistakes.'' The generals had never given civilian rule the chance. Of course, that was precisely the precious opportunity that Zardari's critics said he was so recklessly putting at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a young man in Karachi, Asif Ali Zardari had a distinctly raffish reputation. A contemporary of Zardari's from those days told me that his family had warned him away from Zardari, who was said to run in a bad crowd. His father had been a middling landowner -- a feudal, in Pakistani terms -- who had urbanized and owned the Bambino Cinema, which showed American movies. As a kid, Zardari hung around the theater and got into scrapes. He went to London, where, according to his wife -- in her autobiography, ''Daughter of the East'' -- he attended the ''London Centre of Economic and Political Studies.'' Zardari now says he studied at something called the London School of Business Studies. Young Zardari seemed much more interested in spending money than in making it. He had a disco in his house -- very much the rage in Karachi at the time -- and he drank and chased women. He was an ardent polo player with his own squad, known as the Zardari Four. He was handsome, trim in his polo outfit, with a flourishing mustache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari pretends -- but just barely -- to be stumped by accounts of his former exploits. When I asked about the fabulous jewelry he bought and the great wine he drank once he came into real money, he waggled his eyebrows, Groucho-wise, in mute acknowledgment of past delights. ''I will not comment on those things,'' he said gravely, ''because Islam forbids drinking.'' What's more, he added, with a show of indignation, ''this description you give -- who is fun-loving, who is easygoing, who is consumption of Scotching and wining and dining and dancing -- why would that kind of man opt for a life that he knows for sure that he will have to go through a lot of trouble and tribulation?'' Why, in short, would he marry Benazir Bhutto -- besides the fact that she was the most dazzling woman in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, beautiful, rich and famous? Zardari says that he wooed Bhutto because ''she was the ultimate hope for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' O.K. He also said, rather mysteriously, ''Benazir and myself are related.'' This, if true, was news to even very knowledgeable observers. Whatever the case, Zardari pursued Bhutto tirelessly, while his stepmother worked on Bhutto's female relatives, in the time-honored fashion. Bhutto writes that she found him gallant, gracious and charming. In December 1987, they married. One year later, she won a resounding electoral victory and became prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the course of the next seven years, while his wife was in and out of power, he appears to have spent his time making himself immensely wealthy. He bought a 355-acre estate south of London and an apartment in London, among other properties. Investigators once found an account at Citibank with more than $40 million in it. The revenue for all this is widely believed to have come from bribes; Zardari became known as ''Mr. 10 Percent.'' He came to be seen as well as something of a thug: among the notorious tales from that time that Pakistanis love repeating to one another was one from 1990, when Zardari supposedly strapped a bomb to a man's leg and forced him to withdraw millions of rupees from his bank account. Saeed Minhas, the Islamabad editor of Daily Aajkal, first met Zardari at this time and was shocked to discover, upon being hugged by him, that Zardari had a pistol tucked into his salwar kameez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the many court cases mounted against Zardari and his wife were one in Switzerland claiming that he had received illegal commissions in exchange for awarding contracts to two Swiss companies and another for supposedly taking bribes from a Dubai-based gold-bullion dealership. Pakistani investigative officials claimed that the Bhutto family and associates took in more than $1.5 billion through various questionable schemes during this period. Nevertheless, Zardari can rightly assert that he has never been convicted, though in large part because Musharraf passed an ordinance wiping out pending cases against senior officials (himself included).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari was imprisoned once again after Bhutto's second tenure ended in 1996, and he remained in jail until 2004. He was an ''A Class'' prisoner, enjoying fine meals delivered from the Bhutto mansion, but he also says he was tortured, including having his tongue ripped open. The injustice and the suffering he endured -- and endured with excellent humor and composure -- provided him with a moral currency, which he otherwise altogether lacked, in the culture of the PPP. Indeed, when I asked Farhatullah Babar, the party spokesman, why the PPP chose Zardari to lead it, he said, ''One factor was this'' -- and pulled down from the wall a framed copy of a letter Bhutto wrote out by hand. Babar read aloud the crucial passage: ''I would like my husband Asif Ali Zar/dari to lead you in the interim period until you and he decide what is best. I say this because he is a man of courage and honor. He spent more than 11 1/2 years in prison without bending despite torture.'' This document is dismissed as a transparent forgery by the many people who loathe Zardari. As with practically everything else about him, the truth is very difficult to determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari does seem to have exhausted much of the deep well of loyalty from which Benazir Bhutto and her father drew. I met any number of people who told me that they had been party members practically since birth, that the Bhuttos had stayed at their parents' homes -- and that while they would never, ever abandon the party, they had given up on Zardari. Safdar Abbasi, who had worked with Benazir since 1983 and was with her when she died, said to me: ''Mr. Zardari had the opportunity of continuing with the legacy of both the Bhuttos and going on with the populist line. Instead, he opted for power politics.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue that comes up again and again is Zardari's supplanting of competent figures in favor of a tight, and isolating, circle of loyalists, friends from prison days and family members. Rehmat Shah Afridi, the publisher of The Frontier Post, a former boon companion of Zardari and still, he says, a confidant, speaks much more fondly of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president than do many others. ''He is a very good friend,'' Afridi says. ''He never thinks, You are a small man, or a poor man, and I am a big man.'' But even Afridi says that Zardari's fatal weakness is his habit of trusting his friends -- or the wrong friends. He recalls visiting Zardari last spring and saying: ''Please, Asif, who is on your left and right? If they did some good for you when you were in prison, give them some portfolio, but don't put them in your kitchen cabinet.'' Zardari, he says, ''is surrounded by the most corrupt people, from Karachi and Khyber.'' I asked Afridi why Zardari consorts with these characters. ''Because,'' he said, ''they know how to butter him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government-by-crony is scarcely unheard-of in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- or elsewhere. But the urgency of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problems make clubhouse rule seem like a dangerous anachronism. One morning I met with Ahmad Mukhtar, the minister of defense. I asked an aide why we were meeting in the office of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Airlines. ''Oh,'' he said, ''Mr. Mukhtar is also chairman of P.I.A.'' -- another government post. Mukhtar offered a series of extremely stilted explanations for his party's behavior in the current political crisis as well as for the president's accumulation of wealth -- ''Anyone who has land will become very rich in this country'' -- and spoke of military matters with surprising vagueness. I asked if he had a background in either the military or aviation. ''No,'' he said, ''I'm a businessman. We're into shoes.'' His family had 400 shoe stores. More important, he was a PPP veteran and a Zardari loyalist who spent time with him in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY MARCH 12, THE FIRST DAY of the long march, Pakistanis were watching the narrative of ''movement politics'' unfold -- live, on television -- as policemen in riot gear lobbed tear-gas canisters at lawyers in black suits, ladies in high heels, PML-N workers and the more battle-hardened rank and file of the Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami. By the following day, the ''AA,'' as the Pakistanis say -- the army and the Americans, the twin bogeys of civilian government -- had swung into action. The army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, had met several times with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and with Zardari. He was said to be urging compromise with the marchers, though the meetings themselves awakened fears from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not-very-distant past. Anne Patterson, the American ambassador, met with both Zardari and Nawaz Sharif. Richard Holbrooke, President Obama's special envoy for the region, spoke with Zardari; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a 25-minute conversation with Zardari and spoke with Sharif as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For perhaps the first time in the history of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, these feared forces, the AA, were trying to protect democracy rather than curtail it -- though you could argue that all this meddling only confirmed, and perpetuated, the country's political immaturity. In any case, neither side was prepared to buckle under outside pressure: Zardari offered to reopen the Supreme Court case against the Sharifs, but not to restore the judges; Sharif refused to call off the march. The confrontation moved toward its climax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was very easy to forget, amid all the hullabaloo, exactly why it was that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the world's sixth most populous nation, with 170 million people, so desperately needs effective governance. It's the threat of extremism, of course, that accounts for all those phone calls from high-ranking American officials. But the exigencies of daily life come first for most Pakistani citizens. I received a sobering account of economic failure from Shaukat Tarin, the minister of finance. A former Citibank executive with an old-fashioned banker's girth, Tarin is one of the very few technocrats in a cabinet consisting largely of loyalists. It was Tarin who steered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> away from the shoals of bankruptcy last fall by negotiating a $7.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Now he is trying to make long-term plans -- which, he added, the president had given him a free hand to do. Tarin ticked off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismal current indicators: the growth rate of agricultural production has dropped every decade, and the country is now importing wheat; real income growth has been concentrated among the urban middle class, while rural poverty has increased; manufacturing is in decline; the information-/technology sector booming in India barely exists. Only remittances from Pakistanis working abroad have staved off disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody's favorite front-line state, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suffered the ''foreign-aid curse'' as other nations suffer ''the resource curse.'' As Tarin put it, ''We have avoided the tough decisions, and we just keep hoping that something will happen, and we will get this infusion of foreign aid.'' Tax-collection rates are dismal, and the country spends paltry sums on education and health. Little serious planning has been done on either agriculture or manufacturing. Infrastructure remains primitive. And the bureaucratic culture sedates the entrepreneurial spirit. ''There's no performance management,'' Tarin said, ''no merit, a lot of nepotism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Tarin if he worried that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> political melodrama would diffuse the intense focus the country's problems require. He laughed uneasily. The country's chaotic politics ''could have wrecked the very democracy we were talking about,'' he said. ''You cannot achieve economic stability without political stability.'' But when I asked Tarin if any of his cabinet colleagues shared his sense of urgency and of the need for systemic change, he maintained a prudent silence. ''This is the long-term history of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said. ''This is not one government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari maintains that while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imported grain last year -- when he wasn't in office -- it had a bumper crop this year. He seemed to share Tarin's view of the dangers of aid dependence. ''The world philosophers,'' he asserted, ''have come to the conclusion that aid has never been one of the best ways of developing countries.'' But then he scrambled his talking points and said that when he first spoke with Bush administration officials, he called for a ''Marshall Plan'' for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civilian government does at least exercise control over the economy, but national security and defense remain the domain of the military. Early in his tenure, Zardari made several bold efforts to assert civilian authority over the military. He sought to transfer control over the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the feared military-intelligence service, from the army to the Ministry of the Interior; the military simply refused. In the aftermath of the terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, carried out by Pakistanis apparently operating from a Pakistani base, Prime Minister Gilani said that Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of the ISI, would go to India to coordinate the investigation; instead, a lower-level official was dispatched. After these episodes, Zardari backed off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between the military and the civilian government is thoroughly opaque, and you can hear wildly different views about the ambitions of the military from Pakistani analysts. Rifaat Hussain, a military analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, says flatly, ''I can assure you that General Kayani has absolutely no political ambitions.'' I heard the same view from retired military officials and diplomats. Others are not nearly so persuaded. Samina Ahmed of the International Crisis Group worries that American military officials are far too inclined to accept Kayani's insistence that he wishes to return the military to the barracks. She points out that he previously served as director-general of the ISI, which is notorious for playing by its own rules -- and elements of which, according to American officials cited in a recent New York Times account, continue to work with terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, which appears to have planned the November </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai. During the crisis of the long march, Ahmed said, the military ''would have been given a pretext to intervene,'' if only by forcing the antagonists to settle on terms of its own devising. No one I spoke with said he believed that the military wanted to seize power, but many argued that it seeks to expand its own space at the expense of civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, of course, a reciprocal relationship between weak civilian governance and military supremacy. Lt. Gen. Talat Masood, a retired officer and a leading military analyst, pointed out that so long as party hacks serve in the most sensitive positions, the military will feel justified in preserving its position. Another example of weak governance, according to Masood, was Zardari's statement in a speech that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not be the first to use nuclear weapons against India -- a break with Pakistani doctrine hailed by many as a significant breakthrough. Not Masood: ''I would have been very happy if he had seriously said, 'No first use.' But the way he did it was irrelevant. It wasn't part of a larger strategic rethinking. He didn't discuss it with the military'' -- which controls nuclear policy. ''He doesn't even understand the vocabulary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zardari actually seems less encumbered by the obsession with India, and less equivocal about the need to take on terrorists, than most of his predecessors, including his wife. Precisely because he is an outsider, he was not immersed in the culture of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security services. And yet the widespread perception that he has tacitly approved the Americans' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as occasional hot-pursuit violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, has damaged him politically. And in any case, his failure to formulate a coherent security policy, much less to articulate it in public, has reduced his views almost to a curiosity. Masood, an avowed foe of military supremacy, is biting on the subject. ''The only way to counter the rising force of extremism in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> today is through the strengthening of civil society,'' he told me. ''Zardari is doing just the opposite.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underneath all of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problems is the failure to provide decent governance. Extremism flourishes in the absence of legitimate state authority. This is patent in the self-governing tribal areas along the Afghan border, but the most striking current example is the Swat Valley, once a honeymooners' paradise and now a militant statelet within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formal jurisdiction. The army actually succeeded in pushing militants out of the area in 2006 and 2007. But the government of the North-West Frontier Province, which Musharraf had given as a sort of prize to his more moderate Islamist allies, made little attempt to field a police presence, or to provide the services, above all functioning courts, that residents of the area demanded. These are the same demands Pakistanis elsewhere have made; the difference was that in Swat the extremists offered themselves as an alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new provincial government elected in 2008 promised to negotiate with the extremists rather than fight them. And that is precisely what has happened. The forces of Sufi Muhammad, the militant leader, have laid down their arms in exchange for a pledge to create Shariah courts. But other militants have an agenda of their own, including closing down girls' schools. Most analysts were appalled by the deal. ''It was an act of capitulation,'' says Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States. ''And there's no assurance that this will be the final domino.'' Zardari, to his credit, has so far refused to sign off on the deal. But there's little he can do to affect the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, American policy is coming down the road like a monster truck. With the strategic reviews now complete, the Obama administration is planning an enormous increase in development aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, reaching $1.5 billion a year over five years, as well as an increase in military aid, to be directed to counterinsurgency warfare. The administration's increasing receptivity to negotiating with some elements of the Taliban and fighting others puts it far more in line with Pakistani thinking than the Bush administration ever was. But as President Obama said on March 27, ''after years of mixed results'' from military aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ''we will not provide a blank check.'' Obama emphasized that extremists ''are a grave and urgent danger to the people of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' Someone in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must make that case, and it can't be the army chief of staff. As Ambassador Lodhi told me: ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs strong leaders who can stand up and say, 'Here is the extremist threat that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faces, and this is what we must do.' We have a democratic government, but they haven't used that status to go to the people and articulate a policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNDAY, MARCH 15, turned out to be one of the most extraordinary, and exciting, days in the recent history of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That morning, a spokesman for the PML-N reported that more than 3,000 party workers had been arrested. Hundreds of police officers surrounded the home of Nawaz Sharif, and officials announced that he would be detained there for the next 72 hours. The lawyers' leader, Aitzaz Ahsan, was detained and then escaped. In Lahore, cadres of the Jamaat-e-Islami Party threw rocks at advancing officers; the officers flung the rocks back and fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets. The roads to Islamabad were sealed off with trucks, containers and steel barriers. The Zardari government appeared to have successfully squelched the long march, even if at real cost to its standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then it hadn't. Around 4:30 that afternoon, the Lahore police district coordinating officer announced his resignation from the force -- live, on television. Other officers followed. Sharif left his home in a caravan of cars -- and as the caravan inched forward, the police fell back and then melted away. The government continued to take a hard line, but plainly, something had happened. Around midnight, reports began to circulate that Prime Minister Gilani would speak. The cabinet was meeting; General Kayani was once again on the scene. Pakistanis, a late-night people in any case, waited hour by hour in front of the television. Finally, at 5 in the morning, Gilani delivered a brief address in which he announced that the government had agreed to reinstate Chief Justice Chaudhry the following Saturday, when Chief Justice Dogar was scheduled to retire from the bench. Sharif and the lawyers agreed to call off the long march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEXT DAY, EVERYONE was jubilant, save PPP officials. The whole nail-biting drama had provided a tremendous boon to Sharif, to the lawyers and to the judiciary, to General Kayani and perhaps to the prime minister -- to everyone, in short, save Asif Ali Zardari. Sheik Mansour Ahmed, a PPP loyalist who earlier solemnly explained to me that the march was a ploy by Islamists to pressure President Zardari into easing up on the militants, now said Gilani was ''not playing a positive role.'' The official line, implausible though it sounded, was that Zar/dari had orchestrated the whole affair. Waqar Khan, a recently minted Zardari insider now serving as minister of investments, told me: ''I think the president has done a phenomenal job by returning the chief justice, and they've done it at the right time. They've accepted the wishes of the people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear what in fact happened that afternoon. Najam Sethi, editor of The Daily Times and one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leading political analysts, says he believes that General Kayani played the decisive role behind the scenes, and that the army thus not only ''re-established its credibility in the eyes of the people'' but also managed to ''cut the president down to size.'' That is not, of course, the way Zardari recounts the events of that day. He says that his government ordered the police to fall back out of concern that ''aggressive parties'' associated with the Sharif brothers might use a confrontation to commit acts of violence. In any case, he said, his law minister had advised him that he could not have two sitting chief justices and so would have to wait for Dogar's retirement to restore Chaudhry. I asked him, frankly incredulous, if he was saying that he had always intended to reinstate Chaudhry but had held off saying so until that moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No,'' Zardari said. ''I'm not saying that. I'm saying that different positions existed given by the law.'' And he apparently had to wait for a clear ruling among his advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's no getting around the damage the president did to his own standing. He tried to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a blow at Nawaz Sharif, his chief adversary, and it was Sharif who emerged the stronger. American officials, increasingly convinced both that Zardari is not the interlocutor they had hoped for and that his days in power may be numbered, have begun to pay more attention to Sharif, long considered dangerously close to Islamist forces. Leading PML-N officials say they have learned from past mistakes. They have learned, for example, to accept an independent media and an independent judiciary. It's not clear if Sharif himself has profited from experience. In the course of a phone conversation last week, he passed up all opportunities for self-scrutiny and advocated a response to terrorism that combined dialogue with tribal elders and economic and social development; military force was apparently not part of the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about President Zardari? I asked him if he had learned any lessons from the previous week. He pondered. ''Every day,'' he said, ''man is growing and learning. What you were yesterday, you are probably not today, because today's you is yesterday's experience. One is always learning.'' Indeed, one is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: April 26, 2009, Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 5 about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misstated the name of a theater owned by the father of the country's president, Asif Ali Zardari, who spent a lot of time there when he was young. It was the Bambino, not the Bambina. (The error also appeared in an article on March 11, 2008, about Zardari.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to a crowded Shiite mosque just south of the capital on Sunday, killing at least 26 people. It was the third suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 24 hours, in a sign that the Pakistani Taliban are overwhelming the nation's security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assault south of the capital, Islamabad, appeared to be carefully planned. It took place in Chakwal, a town that has historically  had strong ties to the Pakistani Army, and in a Shiite mosque. The Pakistani Taliban have increasingly attacked Shiite mosques.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest bombing occurred about 12 hours after a suicide bomber struck in an upper-class neighborhood of Islamabad on Saturday night, killing eight paramilitary security officers assigned to guard foreign diplomats and wealthy residents. On Saturday morning, a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into a group of civilians on the side of the road in Miram Shah, in North Waziristan, killing at least eight people, including schoolchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a telephone interview on Sunday, Hakimullah Mehsud, a powerful deputy to Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, said the Taliban were responsible for the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Islamabad and Chakwal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the Islamabad bombing had been in retaliation for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against him by a remotely piloted American  aircraft on Wednesday  in Orakzai, southwest of Peshawar in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed at least 10 people, American intelligence officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking hurriedly  from Orakzai, Hakimullah  Mehsud said the Pakistani Taliban planned to carry out two bombings a week within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in what he called ''revenge'' against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He did not specify whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be by suicide bombers or in commando-style assaults, a technique used against a police training school in Lahore last week, in which 8 police officers  were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Baitullah Mehsud took responsibility for that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said it was in response to American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officials have said the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed nearly a dozen top   operatives from Al Qaeda based in  havens in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which have intensified since President Asif Ali Zardari took office in September, are among the most effective instruments in the United States arsenal against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, American officials have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior Pakistani officials have routinely protested that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> represent an infringement of Pakistani sovereignty, although the government has quietly assented to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hakimullah Mehsud said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Chakwal on Sunday morning was carried out by a group known as the Fidayeen-e-Islam, part of the broad alliance known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban. The Fidayeen-e-Islam is believed to be led by Qari Hussain, the chief technician and motivator of Taliban suicide bombers, and is based in South Waziristan, according to Taliban experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud said he would release a video showing that the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were being conducted by ''Pakistanis and Muslims,'' and not by foreigners, as the Pakistani government has asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Sunday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a witness at the Shiite mosque told Pakistani television that the suicide bomber had been stopped at the door, but that he had pushed himself forward and then detonated the explosives strapped to his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, John Solecki, an American working for the United Nations who was abducted more than two months ago, was found alive on the side of a road near Quetta just before midnight Saturday, a United Nations spokeswoman, Jennifer Pagonis, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The abductors called the United Nations headquarters in Islamabad shortly after 8 p.m. on Saturday, and said, '' 'John has been released, go and pick up your man,' '' Ms. Pagonis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the call the United Nations had been waiting for since his disappearance, and the only direct communication with his kidnappers, a group that called itself the Baluchistan Liberation United Front, she said. After reports from the abductors that Mr. Solecki was very sick, the United Nations team that picked him up was ''enormously relieved to see he was not critically ill,'' she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She declined to say where Mr. Solecki was on Sunday. The Associated Press reported he had left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the United States. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's strategy of offering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a partnership to defeat the insurgency here calls for a virtual remaking of this nation's institutions and even of the national psyche, an ambitious agenda that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politicians and people appear unprepared to take up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officially, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government welcomed Mr. Obama's strategy, with its hefty infusions of American money, hailing it as a ''positive change.'' But as the Obama administration tries to bring Pakistanis to its side, large parts of the public, the political class and the military have brushed off the plan, rebuffing the idea that the threat from Al Qaeda and the Taliban, which Washington calls a common enemy, is so urgent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some, including the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the president, Asif Ali Zardari, may be coming around. But for the military, at least, India remains priority No. 1, as it has for the 61 years of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How to shift that focus in time for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to defeat a fast-expanding Islamic insurgency that threatens to devour the country is the challenge facing Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to the region, as they arrive in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for talks early this week. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Strengthening </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weak civilian institutions, updating political parties rooted in feudal loyalties and recasting a military fixated on yesterday's enemy, and stuck in the traditions of conventional warfare, are generational challenges. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may not have the luxury of the long term to meet them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some analysts here and in Washington are already putting forward apocalyptic timetables for the country. ''We are running out of time to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> change its present course toward increasing economic and political instability, and even ultimate failure,'' said a recent report by a task force of the Atlantic Council that was led by former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. The report, released in February, gave the Pakistani government 6 to 12 months before things went from bad to dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A specialist in guerrilla warfare, David Kilcullen, who advised Gen. David H. Petraeus when General Petraeus was the American commander in Iraq, offered a more dire assessment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be facing internal collapse within six months, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Petraeus, in Congressional testimony last week, called the insurgency one that could ''take down'' the country, which is home to Qaeda militants and has nuclear arms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before the insurgency has been fully engaged, however, many Pakistanis have concluded that reaching an accommodation with the militants is preferable to fighting them. Some, including mid-ranking soldiers, choose to see the militants not as the enemy, but as fellow Muslims who are deserving of greater sympathy than are the American aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is problematic whether the backing of Mr. Zardari, and the Obama's administration's promise of $1.5 billion in aid for each of the next five years, can change the mood in the country, said a former interior minister, Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, who visited Washington last fall to meet with some of the people who are now officials in the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fighting the insurgency is commonly seen in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an American cause, not a Pakistani one, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are  questions, too, of whether the Obama offer of nearly $3 billion in counterinsurgency aid  can  quickly convert the Pakistani military from a force trained to fight India on the plains of Punjab into an outfit that can  conquer the mountains of the tribal areas, where the militants operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''After such a long time of being with the Americans, the country has been through such stress and strain and nothing good has come of it,'' Mr. Sherpao said. ''A cross-section of people is dead set against the Americans. Another section is not happy but not vocal. About 1 to 2 percent would say this policy of America should continue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The distrust has been heightened by charges from American officials, including General Petraeus and Mr. Holbrooke, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency is still supporting the Islamic militants who pour over the border to fight American troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A former director general of the agency Inter-Services Intelligence, Lt. Gen. Javed Ashraf, said the American opinions -- long held but now publicly stated -- did not augur well. A spokesman for the Pakistani military called them ''baseless'' and part of a ''malicious campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You can't start a successful operation with a trust deficit,'' General Ashraf said. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an ally. But then you say we are linked with the Taliban. The serving army people will say, 'To hell with them if this is what we are going to get after laying down more than 1,500 lives.' '' That is the number of soldiers the Pakistani Army says have been killed fighting the militants in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lack of trust was evident, military analysts said, in the American refusal to consider a request from the Pakistani military that it operate the remotely piloted aircraft the C.I.A. has been using to hit the militants in the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although those Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been successful in killing top Qaeda operatives, a factor acknowledged privately by Pakistani officials, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to be criticized even as the new Pakistani-American partnership was supposed to be taking root.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not a strategy -- not even part of a strategy,'' a former army chief of staff and ambassador to Washington, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, said in a front-page article in the newspaper The Nation. ''They are tactical actions to ratchet up body counts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans have been stingy on even the more basic tools for guerrilla warfare, like helicopter gunships and night-vision goggles, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has requested for the past three years, Pakistani military officials say. There are still doubts that Washington will deliver such equipment speedily, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is India. Its growing presence in Afghanistan -- the building of roads; the opening since 2001 of two consulates in two cities close to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- makes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believe it is being encircled, said Ishaq Khan Khakwani, a former senator from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-Q party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistanis complain that even though Mr. Obama, during his European trip, called for dialogue between India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his plans fail to address this major strategic concern. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The United States has to get India to back off in Afghanistan,'' said Mr. Khakwani, who is sympathetic to the American position. ''Then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will see Indian interference is diminished and that will give confidence to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deep questioning about why the Pakistani Army should fight the Taliban reaches well down into the ranks of the soldiers and their families. Dissent on  that goal has become increasingly prevalent among rank-and-file soldiers, and even in the officer corps, said Riffat Hussain, a professor of international relations at Quaid-i-Azam University here who also lectures to soldiers at the National Defense University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been at least a half-dozen reported courts-martial of soldiers who refused to fight, and the real number was probably larger, Professor Hussain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Jhelum, a town 100 miles south of Islamabad and a place with a proud military history, one village had shown in the boldest terms the anger about the military fighting Muslims on Pakistani soil, said Enver Baig, a former senator with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peoples Party, who considers himself a pro-American politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the body of a soldier killed in the tribal areas was taken  home to his  family last year, the father refused to accept his son's coffin, Mr. Baig said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the father took off his shoe and used it to slap the army officer who had escorted  the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A month later, when another soldier's body was delivered to the same village, the army left the body on the village outskirts, Mr. Baig said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put Moscow in Difficult Spot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enemies of the Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov, keep turning up dead. Now the Kremlin, which installed him as president and is relying on him to stamp out an insurgency that threatened to wrest the republic from Moscow's control, is being condemned for allowing violence, including the regime's use of abduction and torture, to continue.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of six car bombings in and near Baghdad killed at least 33 people and wounded scores of others in a convulsion of violence that underscored the heightened tensions between Sunni fighters and Iraq's government. PAGE A6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCUSATIONS OVER ROLE IN TORTURE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical personnel were present as guards confined prisoners in small boxes, shackled their arms to the ceiling, kept them in frigid cells and were deeply involved in the abusive interrogation and torture of terrorist suspects held overseas by the Central Intelligence Agency, a long-secret report by the International Committee of the Red Crosshas concluded.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$1.1 Trillion in Name Only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an extraordinary number, $1.1 trillion in aid, to be pumped into the world's financial bloodstream. On closer inspection, the figure looks as wishful as the words in the communique issued by the Group of 20, with some of the money yet to be pledged, some double-counted and some to be counted in a ''synthetic currency.''

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case against Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was to be an achievement for the Justice Department's elite anticorruption unit.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syracuse television station received a letter apparently from Jiverly Wong, the gunman responsible for one of the deadliest mass shootings in New York's history. The envelope was packed with personal items, leading authorities to believe that it was authentic.

Madoff's Ponzi scheme has been accused of fraud and deception in a civil law suit. The suit does not accuse Mr. Merkin of knowing about Mr. Madoff's fraud, but it contends that he failed to properly oversee or investigate the situation beforehand. Page B1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a new buyout artist in town: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that's right, the F.D.I.C. Its recent plan is to offer $2 trillion to private investors who would use the loans to buy toxic assets from the nation's banks and if the investor loses money, he would owe the taxpayer nothing. But if we've learned one thing, Andrew Sorkin writes, it's that risk-free investing is kind of an oxymoron. Page B1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RISKS IN EXTRACTING MEDICAL DEVICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pulling a medical device off the market is one thing, but over the next several years thousands may face risky surgical procedures to have a device removed from their bodies. The Sprint Fidelis, a heart defibrillator cable has been linked to five patient deaths, and 150,000 people around the country are still using the it. Some are having the device removed as a preventative measure. Page B1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study, ''The Geography of Buzz,'' locates hot spots based on the frequency and draw of cultural happenings: film screenings, concerts, fashion shows, and gallery and theater openings. It finds that the buzziest areas in New York are not the Lower East Side, Williamsburg or any other hipster-centric neighborhoods. PAGE C1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't feel guilty about laughing so hard at ''Why Torture Is Wrong, and the People Who Love Them,'' Christopher Durang's new comedy about all-American violence. Though it tackles subjects that are sensitive to the point of rawness just now, the production has a healthier heart and conscience than many a more pious play, Ben Brantley writes.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHANGING OF GUARD REVEALS A SHIFT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Daily Variety's longtime editor in chief, Peter Bart, surrendered power over the weekend, many industry people learned not from the company's Web site, where it broke the news, but from an e-mail alert sent by a blog, thewrap.com, that did not exist six months ago. So it goes for the venerable trade publication in a Hollywood where independent bloggers have severely lessened its impact. PAGE C1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The art of keeping up appearances when you're in desperate straits may seem shallow, the very embodiment of denial, but many psychologists beg to differ. To the extent that it sustains good habits and reflects personal pride, they say, this kind of play-acting can be an effective social strategy, especially in uncertain times. PAGE D1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scratching to relieve an itch has long been considered a mystery.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUBLIC PLAN FOR HEALTH INSURANCE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has rightly called for sweeping health care reform and charged Congress with coming up with a program. Expect a tough political fight. Already one of the most contentious issues is whether to include a new public plan option to compete with private insurance plans. It seems worth trying. Page A28</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CASH FOR CLUNKERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's rescue plan for the automotive industry has given the presidential seal of approval to a little-noticed movement in Congress to clear the roads of gas-guzzling clunkers and replace them with more fuel-efficient cars. It's an excellent idea, but there's a right and wrong way to do it. Page A28</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO MUCH FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With each passing day, it becomes more likely that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will greatly increase the cost of public transit -- and that these platinum-priced tickets will buy a lot less service than people are accustomed to. The New York State Senate can prevent this unfortunate outcome. But it shows no sign of doing so. Page A28</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID BROOKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, many psychologists, cognitive scientists and even philosophers embrace a view of morality in which seeing and evaluating are not two separate processes, they are linked and basically simultaneous. The question then becomes, what shapes moral emotions in the first place? The answer has long been evolution, but in recent years there's an increasing appreciation that evolution isn't just about competition, it's also about cooperation within groups. Page A29</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced a major reshaping of the Pentagon budget on Monday, with deep cuts in many traditional weapons systems but new billions of dollars for others, along with more troops and new technology to fight the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decisions are expected to set off a vigorous round of lobbying over the priorities embroidered into the Defense Department's half-trillion dollars of annual spending. They represent the first broad rethinking of American military strategy under the Obama administration, which plans to shift more money to counterterrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan while spending less on preparations for conventional warfare against large nations like China and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gates announced cuts in missile defense programs, the Army's expensive Future Combat Systems and Navy shipbuilding operations. He would kill controversial programs to build a new presidential helicopter and a new communications satellite system, delay the development of a new bomber and order only four more of the advanced F-22 fighter jets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said plans to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, while halting reductions in Air Force and Navy personnel, would cost an additional $11 billion. He also announced an extra $2 billion for intelligence and surveillance equipment, including new Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the remote-controlled vehicles currently used in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afghanistan and Iraq for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants, and more spending on special forces and training foreign military units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More broadly, Mr. Gates signaled that he hoped to impose a new culture on the Pentagon -- making the system more flexible and responsive to the needs of the troops in the way it chooses and buys weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, he acknowledged that it would be hard, with the economic crisis and concerns in Congress over jobs, to ''make tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military experts said Mr. Gates seemed to be mounting a determined effort to rein in some of the most troubled programs after years of record military spending and start dealing with the huge cost overruns and delays that have plagued so many programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some noted that other presidents and defense secretaries had been stymied in making similar efforts in the past, and they said that leaders of military-related committees in Congress would undoubtedly try to save the F-22, C-17 cargo planes and other systems that Mr. Gates would like to cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Ike Skelton, the Missouri Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Monday in a statement that while Mr. Gates's proposed budget was a ''good faith'' effort, ''the buck stops with Congress, which has the critical constitutional responsibility to decide whether to support these proposals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some military analysts reacted to Mr. Gates's promise of budget revolution with skepticism. Andrew H. Krepinevich Jr., a military expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said that it was hard to tell how much Mr. Gates was reducing spending over all because he was increasing spending in unspecified amounts in some areas and had not put a net dollar amount on his entire proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Krepinevich said he anticipated that Mr. Gates's reductions would not close the $25 billion to $50 billion Bush-era gap between military programs and the spending for them, and that future cuts would most likely be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that some of Mr. Gates's cuts were less than draconian. While the secretary chose to emphasize smaller, speedy ships for close-in waters, the slower shipbuilding he proposed for the deep-water Navy would not reduce the number of aircraft-carrier battle groups at sea to 10 from 11 until after 2040.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he capped the number of the $150 million combat plane, the Air Force's F-22, at 187, he promised to speed the testing of another fighter, the F-35, and maintain plans to eventually buy 2,443 of the planes. While he canceled the purchases of eight Army vehicles to allow for more study and a rebidding, he said he would also speed the development of costly electronic sensors for troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while he promised to fix the flawed procurement processes that allow weapons prices to soar, he said he wanted to hire tens of thousands of civil servants to do the work, since contracting that out to the private sector has not proven efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The perennial procurement and contracting cycle, going back many decades, of adding layer and layer of cost and complexity onto fewer and fewer platforms that take longer and longer to build, must come to an end,'' he said. ''There is broad agreement on the need for acquisition and contracting reform in the Department of Defense. There have been enough studies, enough hand-wringing, enough rhetoric. Now is the time for action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes will mean fewer big ships, and a reduction in the number of Army brigades, but with the same number of troops so that the combat forces are not hollowed out, and bolstering the Army's helicopter forces, Mr. Gates said. He added that he wanted to add 2,800 to the ranks of special forces troops and more cybersecurity experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending on missile defense programs will be scaled back by $1.4 billion over all. Mr. Gates proposed increasing spending to defend against relatively limited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by smaller powers with shorter-range missiles, adding interceptors aboard ships but not on land in Alaska. But he would cancel or delay some of the more exotic programs to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gates also said that while he planned to halt a Navy program to build a new class of stealth destroyers, he would finish constructing the first three ships if the contractors agreed to allow all of them to be built at one shipyard instead of the dividing the work between two yards. Otherwise, he would only build one of the $3 billion ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year Mr. Gates made the unusual decision to publicly announce his proposed reductions in the Pentagon budget before the recommendations are sent to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told reporters last week that Mr. Gates, a Republican who has worked for eight presidents of both parties, may have been trying to provide some political cover for Mr. Obama over the cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, reacted strongly against Mr. Gates's proposal to end spending for the F-22, which employs 25,000 workers in Georgia and across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's outrageous that President Obama is willing to bury the country under a mountain of debt with his reckless domestic agenda but refuses to fund programs critical to our national defense,'' Mr. Price said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, a bipartisan group of six senators urged Mr. Gates not to make large cuts in missile defense programs. In a letter to Mr. Obama, they said the reductions ''could undermine our emerging missile defense capabilities to protect the United States against a growing threat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group included the Republicans Jon Kyl of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma as well as Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly restored chief justice of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> displayed his reputation as a human rights advocate and a prod to the government on Monday, when he hauled the attorney general and other officials before the Supreme Court and rebuked them over the flogging of a 17-year-old woman in the Taliban-controlled area of Swat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, assailed the officials for laziness and self-importance, and challenged them for not taking up the case until it became a national scandal in recent days, when a video showing the woman pinned to the ground and repeatedly whipped by a Taliban commander was broadcast on Pakistani television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Before the video became public, what were you doing, why couldn't you find out what had happened?'' Mr. Chaudhry asked the attorney general, Sardar Latif Khosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By choosing to highlight the terror in Swat, Mr. Chaudhry, who has been back on the bench about two  weeks after two years of enforced limbo, immediately returned to his role of shaming an acquiescent government and military into acting in the face of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, Mr. Chaudhry and his seven fellow judges demanded that the officials bring the woman, known as Chand, before the court as part of an investigation into what had happened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the officials failed to produce her Monday, the hearing turned into a critical public airing of the government's decision to enter a peace deal in February that effectively gave the Taliban control over Swat, just 100 miles from the capital, Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attorney general, Mr. Khosa, aware that the situation was embarrassing for the government, asked at the outset that the hearing be held behind closed doors, a request Mr. Chaudhry batted away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the volley of exchanges between the judges and the officials, and an impassioned account by a prominent lawyer before the court of the terror in Swat, it became clear that the Taliban ran the area with impunity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chand was singled out for the punishment after she declined a Taliban fighter's proposal for marriage, the head of the Peshawar Bar Association, Abdul Latif Afridi, said after the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After her refusal to marry, an electrician visited the family home, and, according to Mr. Afridi's account, the scorned Taliban suitor saw her leave the house with the workman. She was flogged on March 7, accused of consorting with the electrician as an unmarried woman, the lawyer said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the video was first shown on Pakistani television stations last Thursday, it has set off an emotional  national debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some commentators and political leaders have defended the flogging  as being within the bounds of Islamic law. The leader of the right-wing Islamist party Jamaat Islaami said the flogging was unimportant compared to the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in the tribal areas by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Samar Minallah, a rights activist, distributed the video to news outlets after receiving it from a contact in Swat, where it is available in markets. Ms. Minallah said she wanted the nation to know what was going on in the area that federal and provincial officials had  been too afraid to visit since the February peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The atmosphere of fear and the absence of law was most vividly described to the judges by Mr. Afridi, the Peshawar lawyer, who appeared separately from the government officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A seven-month operation by the Pakistani Army against the Taliban from last July until February had resulted ''in a total surrender'' and the killing of hundreds of people by Pakistani soldiers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, he said: ''The most fundamental rights are violated every second of every day. People are being ejected from their houses, courts are closed, 300 schools have been demolished.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than 900 police officers had deserted the force of 1,600 in Swat, and now the Taliban were on the verge of taking over the neighboring area of Dir, Mr. Afridi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After listening to the grim assessment,  Mr.  Chaudhry asked the attorney general what he was doing about Swat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A ''high-powered committee'' had been appointed, the nation's senior lawyer replied. ''We are trying to retrieve the writ of the government,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Chaudhry complained that the police, instead of filing a formal complaint on the flogging the same night the video had first been shown, had waited several days. Had the woman appeared before any court, he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If she has, it's in front of a kangaroo court,'' replied Malik Naveed Khan, the inspector general of police in the North-West Frontier Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then  Mr. Chaudhry turned his attention to the senior official in the Interior Ministry, Kemal Shah, who reached retirement age two years ago but was given an indefinite extension by Pervez Musharraf, the president at the time, to serve as secretary of the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why had the secretary not been to Swat, the chief justice asked, a question that was a clear challenge to the government's impotence in an area where even the military fears to operate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Faced with silence, the judge ordered: ''You go to Swat yourself. You must be very bright. You go yourself. We command you do it and report to us what is happening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the hearing, a journalist from Swat, Ehsan Haqqani, who reports for The Associated Press of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said he was pleased that the Supreme Court had brought attention to a situation most others had ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were the forgotten people,'' said Mr. Haqqani, who has edited a collection of essays, ''The Plea of Swat,'' published by Shoaib Sons Publishers in Mingora, Swat. ''The government was only a silent spectator. Now the Supreme Court is forcing the government to take notice. That is encouraging for us.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite threats of retaliation from Pakistani militants, senior administration officials said Monday that the United States intended to step up its use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and might extend them to a different sanctuary deeper inside the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, a senior Taliban leader vowed to unleash two suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a week like one on Saturday in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capital, Islamabad, unless the Central Intelligence Agency stopped firing missiles at militants. Pakistani officials have expressed concerns that the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from remotely piloted aircraft fuel more violence in the country, and some American officials say they are also concerned about some aspects of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to the region, arrived in Islamabad on Monday, the administration officials said the plan to intensify missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> underscored President Obama's goal to ''disrupt, dismantle and defeat'' Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, as well as to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at other militant groups allied with Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials are also proposing to broaden the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Baluchistan, south of the tribal areas, unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> manages to reduce the incursion of militants there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Influential American lawmakers have voiced support for the administration's position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, acknowledged last week that ''the price is very heavy'' when missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mistakenly kill civilians, but he said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were ''an extremely effective tool.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plans have met strong resistance from Pakistani officials and have also worried some former American officials and some analysts, who say that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> create greater risks of civilian casualties and could further destabilize the nuclear-armed nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You will be complicating and compounding anti-Americanism here,'' said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad. ''How can you be an ally and at the same time be targeted?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American experts say a crucial change in aerial warfare, in which American forces are now often stalking individuals rather than tanks and other large armaments as in past wars, has raised new legal issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A. John Radsan, who worked as a C.I.A. lawyer from 2002 to 2004, argued in a recent scholarly article he wrote with Richard W. Murphy, a fellow law professor, that the United States should follow the lead of the Israeli Supreme Court and require an investigation of ''targeted killings'' by the C.I.A. to control the practice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the notion of remote-control killing may seem chilling, military experts say the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which can transmit live video for nearly a day at a time, typically supply the weapons targeting officers with enough information to avoid civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marc Garlasco, a former military targeting official who now works for Human Rights Watch, the international advocacy group, said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had  helped limit civilian casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the Air Force uses them to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people laying roadside bombs and to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other insurgents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in trying to take advantage of what can be fleeting chances to kill top Taliban and Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the C.I.A. faces a much more difficult task, especially if it follows the targets into more populated areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When you're operating under very short time frames, like the C.I.A. is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, you are exponentially increasing the risk of killing noncombatants,'' Mr. Garlasco said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the extensive missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been limited to the tribal areas, and authorities say they have killed 9 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders. American officials say the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have forced some Taliban and Qaeda leaders to flee south toward Quetta, a city in the province of Baluchistan, which abuts the parts of southern Afghanistan where recent fighting has been the fiercest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the prized attributes of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the Cessna-size Predators and their larger and more heavily armed cousins called the Reapers -- is that they can linger over an area day after day, sending back video that can be used to build a ''pattern of life'' analysis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some experts have compared them to mini-satellites that can monitor a suspected terrorist compound for weeks, watching where the people go and with whom they interact, to help confirm that the right people are being singled out for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Experts say the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also carry laser-guided weapons with small warheads that are precise enough to kill a group of people in a street without damaging nearby buildings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like the military services, the C.I.A. uses computer software to assess possible collateral damage, and the fusing on the bombs can be adjusted to limit their impact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, it can also be hard to evaluate tips about the locations of Taliban or Qaeda leaders if there are no troops nearby to help check them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the Air Force operates its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from military bases in the United States, the C.I.A. controls its fleet of Predators and Reapers from its headquarters in Langley, Va. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The final preparations for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> take place in a crowded room lined with video screens, where C.I.A. officers work at phone banks and National Security Agency personnel monitor electronic chatter, according to former C.I.A. officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The intelligence officers watch scratchy video captured by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which always fly in pairs above potential targets. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two senior American officials came under withering public criticism from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday, with the Pakistani foreign minister saying that ''trust'' between the  countries was in question, particularly over the issue of American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and the special envoy to the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, at his side, the minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, said: ''We did talk about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and let me be very frank: there is a gap between us.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''The bottom line is the question of trust.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another sign of new strains in the relationship, the head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence service, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, refused to meet separately with Mr. Holbrooke and General Mullen, who had requested a meeting, according to Pakistani officials and an American official, who sought  anonymity because he did not want to further damage relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Pasha did attend a meeting with the two Americans and Pakistani military's chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, according to a statement issued by the press arm of the Pakistani Army after Mr. Holbrooke and General Mullen left Islamabad for India on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Qureshi singled out the issue of the remotely piloted  aircraft armed with missiles that the United States used  against Al Qaeda's havens in the tribal areas adjacent to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But senior Pakistani military and intelligence officers have also been deeply rankled by a public suggestion almost two weeks ago  by Mr. Holbrooke and the head of Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, that the powerful Pakistani intelligence agency was still supporting Taliban fighters who cross into Afghanistan to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke and General  Mullen arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday night for a one-day visit during which they planned to elaborate on the details of the new strategy laid out by President Obama to eliminate  Qaeda sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference at the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Qureshi raised his voice to admonish the two Americans. ''The terms of engagement are very clear,'' he said. ''We will engage with mutual trust and mutual respect, and that is the bottom line.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''We can only work together if we respect each other and trust each other. There is no other way and nothing else will work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the new Obama policy, American officials have said,  new infusions of American military and civilian aid will  be carefully monitored to ensure  it is spent for the intended purposes, and not diverted for other uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama administration officials have said there will  be  ''no blank check for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' In response, Mr. Qureshi said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would ''neither accept nor give one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke said  the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had enjoyed a long relationship and  Washington continued to back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials will meet in Tokyo soon to raise funds to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with its  economic difficulties, he said. ''This is the pattern, that will continue,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article was reported bySabrina Tavernise, Richard A. Oppel Jr.and Eric Schmittand written by Ms. Tavernise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taliban insurgents are teaming up with local militant groups to make inroads in Punjab, the province that is home to more than half of Pakistanis, reinvigorating an alliance that Pakistani and American authorities say poses a serious risk to the stability of the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deadly assault in March in Lahore, Punjab's capital, against the Sri Lankan cricket team, and the bombing last fall of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, the national capital, were only the most spectacular examples of the joint campaign, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now police officials, local residents and analysts warn that if the government does not take decisive action, these dusty, impoverished fringes of Punjab could be the next areas facing the insurgency. American intelligence and counterterrorism officials also said they viewed the developments with alarm. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't think a lot of people understand the gravity of the issue,'' said a senior police official in Punjab, who declined to be idenfitied because he was discussing threats to the state. ''If you want to destabilize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, you have to destabilize Punjab.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disrupt strongholds of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the tribal areas, the insurgents are striking deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- both in retaliation and in search of new havens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Telltale signs of creeping militancy abound in a belt of towns and villages near here that a reporter visited last week. Militants have gained strength considerably in the district of Dera Ghazi Khan, which is a gateway both to Taliban-controlled areas and the heart of Punjab, the police and local residents say. Many were terrified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some villages, just north of here, are so deeply infiltrated by militants that they are already considered no-go zones by their neighbors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In at least five towns in southern and western Punjab, including the midsize hub of Multan, barber shops, music stores and Internet cafes offensive to the militants' strict interpretation of Islam have received threats. Traditional ceremonies that include drumming and dancing have been halted in some areas. Hard-line ideologues have addressed large crowds to push their idea of Islamic revolution. Sectarian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dormant here since the 1990s, have erupted once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's going from bad to worse,'' said a senior police official in Dera Ghazi Khan. ''They are now more active. These are the facts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials agreed. Bruce Riedel, who led the Obama administration's recently completed strategy review of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, said the Taliban now had ''extensive links into the Punjab.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You are seeing more of a coalescence of these militant groups,'' said Mr. Riedel, a former C.I.A. official. ''Connections that have always existed are becoming tighter and more public than they have in the past.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Punjabi militant groups have had links with the Taliban, who are mostly Pashtun tribesmen, since the 1980s. Some of the Punjabi groups are veterans of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> state-sponsored insurgency against Indian forces in Kashmir. Others made targets of Shiites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under pressure from the United States, former President Pervez Musharraf cut back state support for the Punjabi groups. They either went underground or migrated to the tribal areas, where they deepened their ties with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least 20 militants killed in American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas since last summer were Punjabi, according to people from the tribal areas and Pakistani officials. One Pakistani security official estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of militants in the tribal regions could be Punjabi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The alliance is based on more than shared ideology. ''These are tactical alliances,'' said a senior American counterterrorism official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss intelligence matters. The Pashtun Taliban and Arab militants, who are part of Al Qaeda, have money, sanctuary, training sites and suicide bombers. The Punjabi militants can provide logistical help in Punjabi cities, like Lahore, including handling bombers and target reconnaissance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cooperation between the groups intensified greatly after the government's siege of Islamic hard-liners at the Red Mosque in Islamabad, in mid-2007, Pakistani and American security officials say. The siege has since become a rallying cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One such joint operation, an American security official said, was the Marriott bombing in Islamabad in September, which killed more than 50 people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As this cooperation intensifies, places like Dera Ghazi Khan are particularly vulnerable. This frontier town is home to a combustible mix of worries: poverty, a growing phalanx of hard-line religious schools and a uranium processing plant that is a part of Pakisitan's nuclear program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is also strategically situated at the intersection of two main roads. One is a main artery into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heartland, in southern Punjab. The other connects Baluchistan Province in the west to the North-West Frontier Province, both Taliban strongholds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are being cornered in a blind alley,'' said Mohammed Ali, a local landlord. ''We can't breathe easily.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intended to intimidate and sow sectarian strife are more common. The police point to a suicide bombing in Dera Ghazi Khan on Feb. 5. Two local Punjabis, with the help of Taliban backers, orchestrated the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which killed 29 people at a Shiite ceremony, the local police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The authorities arrested two men as masterminds on April 6: Qari Muhammad Ismail Gul, the leader of a local madrasa; and Ghulam Mustafa Kaisrani, a jihadi who posed as a salesman for a medical company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They belonged to a banned Punjabi group called Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, but were tied through phone calls to two deputies of the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, the police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The phone numbers they call are in Waziristan,'' said a police official, referring to the Taliban base in the tribal areas. ''They are working together hand in glove.'' One of the men had gone for training in Waziristan last summer, the police said. The operations are well-supported. Mr. Kaisrani had several bank transfers worth about $11 million from his Pakistani account, the authorities said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local crimes, including at least two recent bank robberies in Dera Ghazi Khan, were also traced to networks of Islamic militants, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The money that's coming in is huge,'' said Zulfiqar Hameed, head of investigations for the Lahore Police Department. ''When you go back through the chain of the transaction, you invariably find it's been done for money.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here, the police confiscated a 20-minute inspirational video, titled ''Revenge,'' for the Red Mosque, which gave testimonials from suicide bombers in different cities and post-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> images. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Umme Hassan, the wife of a fiery preacher who was killed during the Red Mosque siege, now frequently travels to south Punjab, to rally the faithful. She has made 12 visits in the past several months before cheering crowds and showing emotional clips of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said a Punjabi official who has been monitoring her visits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She claimed that they would bring Islamic revolution in three months,'' said Umar Draz, who attended a rally in Muzzafargarh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The situation in south and west Punjab is still far from that in the Swat Valley, a part of North-West Frontier Province that is now fully under Taliban control after the military agreed to a truce in February. But there are strong parallels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban here exploit many of the same weaknesses that have allowed them to expand in other areas: an absent or intimidated police force; a lack of attention from national and provincial leaders; a population steadily cowed by threats, or won over by hard-line mullahs who usurp authority by playing on government neglect and poverty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Shadan Lund, a village just north of here, militants are openly demanding Islamic law, or Shariah, said Jan Sher, whose brother is a teacher there. ''The situation is sharply going toward Swat,'' Mr. Sher said. He and others said the single biggest obstacle to stopping the advance of militancy was the attitudes of Pakistanis themselves, whose fury at the United States has led to blind support for everyone  who  goes against it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shabaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab, said he was painfully aware of the problems of insurgent infiltration and was taking steps to restore people's faith in government, including plans for new schools and hospitals. ''Hearts and minds must be won,'' he said in an interview Monday. ''If this struggle fails, this country has no future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But people complain that landowners and local politicians have done nothing to stop the advance and, in some cases, even assist the militants by giving money to some of the religious schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The government is useless,'' said Mr. Ali, the local landlord. ''They live happy, secure lives in Lahore. Their children study abroad. They only come here to contest elections.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police are left alone to stop the advance. But in Punjab, as in much of the rest of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they are spread unevenly, with little presence in rural areas. Out of 160,000 police officers in Punjab, fewer than 60,000 are posted in rural areas, leaving frontier stations in districts virtually unprotected, police officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Locals feel helpless. When a 15-year-old boy vanished from a madrasa in a village near here recently -- his classmates said to go on jihad -- his uncle could not afford to go look for him, let alone confront the powerful men who run the madrasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are simple people,'' the man said. ''What can we do?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two senior American officials at his side, the Pakistani foreign minister unleashed a strong rebuke last week, saying that American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas were eroding trust between the allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Americans, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and the special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, defended their strategy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Later, Mr. Holbrooke dismissed the salvo by the foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, saying it was to be expected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, both sides have grown accustomed to an unusual diplomatic dance around the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. For all their public protests, behind the scenes, Pakistani officials may countenance the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more than Mr. Qureshi's reprimand would suggest, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and American analysts and officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why else would Pakistani military officials be requesting that the United States give them the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to operate, asked Prof. Riffat Hussain, of the defense studies department at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His answer is that senior Pakistani officials consider the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one of their only effective tools against the militants. Moreover, using the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes pressure off the Pakistani Army, which has proved reluctant to fight the militants, or incapable of doing so, in the rugged mountains along the Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not convinced of the efficacy of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> why would they be asking for the technology?'' asked Professor Hussain, who also lectures at the National Defense University, the main scholarly institution for the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the aircraft, about the size of a Cessna, take off with Pakistani assent from a base inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, American and Pakistani officials acknowledge. A small group of Pakistani intelligence operatives assigned to the tribal areas help choose targets, while the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, armed with Hellfire missiles, are remotely piloted from the United States, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Permission for the aircraft to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas was negotiated by the Bush administration with the former president, Pervez Musharraf, and then with the current leader, Asif Ali Zardari. The Obama administration has renewed those understandings, American and Pakistani officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cooperation has been successful. Nine out of 20 senior operatives from Al Qaeda on a list compiled last year have been killed, according to American military commanders, a fact the Pakistanis do not dispute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as effective as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have proved, the Pakistanis' discomfort with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is real. The larger issue  surrounding the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the trade-off between decapitating the militant hierarchy and the risk of further destabilizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- by undercutting the military and civilian government, by provoking retaliatory </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the militants, and by driving the Taliban and Al Qaeda deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in search of new havens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is the matter  of public perception, particularly over the civilian casualties caused by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which infuriate Pakistani politicians and the media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deaths make it difficult for any Pakistani leader to support the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> publicly. At the same time, the Pakistani disavowals only reinforce the popular notion that the war against the militants merely furthers America's interests, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In public, President Zardari, who is portrayed in much of the Pakistani media as slavishly pro-American, chooses to deny Pakistani participation in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite having agreed to their use, he says the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> represent an infringement of Pakistani sovereignty that the government cannot tolerate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About 500 civilians have been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talat Masood, a former Pakistani general, estimates. But, he said, the government fails to point out that many of those killed are most likely hosting Qaeda militants and cannot be deemed entirely innocent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud, the two senior leaders of Tehrik-e-Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group, said the increasing tempo of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would drive them to respond with more serious terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even as many as two a week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another militant boss, Maulvi Nazir, threatened that the retaliation would include the capture of Islamabad, the capital. Last Thursday, in an interview with Al Sahab, the media arm of Al Qaeda, he said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were the work of both the United States and the Pakistani Army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As proof of his claims, Mr. Nazir's group distributed a video showing young Pakistani tribesmen confessing to having been hired by the Pakistani military to pick targets for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The video was distributed and apparently shot in Wana, the main city of South Waziristan, a  Taliban stronghold. As a finale, the video shows those who had confessed, including some from Mr. Nazir's own group, executed for spying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One intriguing aspect of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that people living in the tribal region under the militants' grip may be more accepting of them than other Pakistanis, according to a recent but limited survey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey, described as unscientific, was conducted in four urban centers in North and South Waziristan and Kurram, all in the tribal region, by a group of academics belonging to the Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy, a small Pakistani research group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Its organizer, Khadim Hussain, a professor of linguistics and communication at Bahria University in Islamabad, an institution backed by the Pakistani Navy, stressed that the survey was only ''exploratory.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of 650 people approached for the survey, 550 answered, according to the institute, which is financed by 10 academics and human rights workers, most of whom come from the tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey was conducted by 25 graduate students from Islamabad who visited the tribal areas from November to January, Professor Hussain said. The margin of error was three to five percentage points, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whether militant groups were hurt by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 60 percent of the respondents said yes, and 40 percent no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whether anti-Americanism in the area had increased because of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 58 percent said it had not; 42 percent said it had. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the question of whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were accurate, 52 percent said they were; 48 percent said they were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The results first stirred debate last month when they were published in a  daily newspaper, The News. They were publicized again last week by The Daily Times, a pro-government newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an editorial in support of the survey, The Daily Times said local reporters from Orakzai, a tribal area recently hit by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found that the people ''would actually want the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to continue to lessen the severity of the Tehrik-e-Taliban control over them.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One reason the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> received support in the tribal region is that they mostly single out Qaeda leaders who are of Arab descent, Professor Hussain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Arabs are widely disliked by the Pashtun tribes that dominate the area because they try to enforce their strict Wahhabi version of Islam,  Professor Hussain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do  feed the militants' propaganda machine, he said. ''But if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stopped,'' he added, ''I wouldn't be sure that they would refrain from the terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they have been doing all along.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen members of the security forces and two civilians were killed in a suicide bombing on Saturday at a joint military and police checkpoint in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police in Doaba, in the Hangu district of North-West Frontier Province, said that three of their men had been wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which hit around the time when the guard was changing at the checkpoint. Eight soldiers were also wounded and were later shifted to a military hospital for treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police blamed the Pakistani Taliban for the bombing, though there was no immediate claim of responsibility by the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military had carried out a major cleanup operation in Doaba in August to flush out Taliban militants who wereinfiltrating from the nearby Kurram and Orakzai tribal regions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Army helicopter gunships have been attacking suspected militant hide-outs in Orakzai in the last couple of weeks. That region is under the sway of Hakimullah Mehsud, a senior Taliban commander. He warned this month that the Pakistani Taliban would carry out two bombings a week in what he called revenge for missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of those missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on April 2, was apparently aimed at Mr. Mehsud. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 10 militants at one of his training camps in the Orakzai region, officials said. Mr. Mehsud was reported to have escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two weeks ago against a checkpoint in an upper-class neighborhood of Islamabad. Eight paramilitary soldiers were killed in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The checkpoint attacked on Saturday sits on the Hangu-Parachinar road, which has been closed to general traffic for over a year because of a Taliban roadblock intended to stop food and fuel supplies to the mainly Shiite population in Kurram's regional headquarters of Parachinar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Hangu district has been a frequent flashpoint for violence between Sunnis and Shiites. Forty-eight people were killed during sectarian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Shiite holy month of Muharram last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Saturday, Asfandyar Wali, the leader of the Awami National Party, which negotiated a peace deal with the Taliban in the district of Swat, defended the party's decision to agree to the introduction of Islamic law in that region. The party is a member of the coalition government led by President Asif Ali Zardari, and has been at the forefront of the decisions to concede authority to the Taliban in Swat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We preferred diplomacy over war,'' Mr. Wali told a news conference in Karachi. ''I don't say this is the best solution,'' he said of the setting up of Islamic courts in Swat. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHEN the Central Intelligence Agency obliterates a dozen suspected terrorists, along with assorted family members, with a missile from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the news rarely stirs a strong reaction far beyond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the waterboarding of three operatives from Al Qaeda -- one of them the admitted murderer of 3,000 people as organizer of the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- has stirred years of recriminations, calls for prosecution and national soul-searching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is it about the terrible intimacy of torture that so disturbs and captivates the public? Why has torture long been singled out for special condemnation in the law of war, when war brings death and suffering on a scale that dwarfs the torture chamber?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those questions arose with new force last week, as President Obama settled a battle between the C.I.A. and the Justice Department by siding with the latter and releasing four excruciatingly detailed legal opinions from the department, written in 2002 and 2005, justifying brutal interrogations. But he also repeated his opposition to a lengthy inquiry into the program, saying that ''nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past.'' The C.I.A. officers who were acting on the Justice Department's legal advice would not be prosecuted, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In their meticulousness, and even their elaborate rules intended to prevent death or permanent injury, the memos became the object of fascination and dread. Who knew that along with waterboarding and wall-slamming, cold cells and sleep deprivation up to 180 hours, the approved invasions of the prisoner's space included the ''facial hold''  -- essentially what grandma does to a visiting grandchild who misbehaves -- with hands holding the sides of the head as questions are asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The fingertips are kept well away from the individual's eyes,'' the memo helpfully adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In releasing the memos, Mr. Obama again denounced harsh interrogation as unworthy of the United States and said the country ''must reject the false choice between our security and our ideals.'' He and other critics have often stated their objections: torture or near-torture can produce false information; it handicaps the United States in a battle of ideas; it can be a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, public opinion has shown less horror over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out by Hellfire missiles fired from Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the weeks since those deadly missions have been embraced and even expanded to new territories under Mr. Obama. This is presumably because the president's implicit view of the relative moral status of these two ways of responding to terrorists is widely shared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One former C.I.A. official, who in the current atmosphere insisted on not being named, and whose duties at times included briefing the Congressional intelligence committees, said he was bemused by reactions of lawmakers on those panels. Members would be thrilled and cheered by the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> videos he would bring along -- and then grill and berate him over the agency's interrogation methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The hands-on nature of torture lends it particular power, said Andrea Northwood, a psychologist who has treated hundreds of people at the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis. Even when the victim is a figure like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the 9/11 plotter, torture carries a vicarious chill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a profoundly affecting tool in evoking primal terror,'' Dr. Northwood said. ''We can easily put ourselves in that situation, and that terrifies us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Darius Rejali, the author of ''Torture and Democracy,'' a massive 2007 history of the myriad ways humans have tormented other humans, said he had often been struck by the disproportionate emotional response to death and torture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What's fascinating to people about torture is it gives one person absolute power over another, which is both alluring and corrupting,'' said Dr. Rejali, a professor of political science at Reed College. Torture, like slavery, corrupts both individuals and societies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But what about the absolute power of the C.I.A. ''pilot,'' thousands of miles from his unmanned aerial vehicle, who pushes a button and unleashes distant death? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a different former C.I.A. official said, ''Imagine a Hellfire missile coming through your roof.  You die in a burning pile of rubble. Isn't that torture?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not quite, Dr. Rejali responds. ''The people you're killing with a Predator,'' he said, ''are not detained and helpless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ever since word leaked that the C.I.A. subjected Mr. Mohammed and two other prisoners in 2002 and early 2003 to waterboarding, the near-drowning method with a pedigree stretching back to the Spanish Inquisition and beyond, that fact has resonated powerfully in American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2007, long after the events, Michael B. Mukasey's nomination as attorney general almost faltered when he refused to call waterboarding torture. Mr. Obama's choice to head the Justice Department, Eric H. Holder Jr., swiftly and strongly declared what to many people was the obvious, as did Leon E. Panetta, the new C.I.A. director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the episodes showed is what Senator John McCain, perhaps this country's most famous torture victim, has often said about why the United States must not use it: ''It's not about the terrorists,'' he says. ''It's about us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It may be that the revelations of the interrogation memos, ending the secrecy about what was done, will quiet the furor over torture. But it seems unlikely. So far every new disclosure about the intimate brutality carried out in the name of national security has only provoked more questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is pouring more than 20,000 new troops into Afghanistan this year for a fighting season that the United States military has called a make-or-break test of the allied campaign in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if Taliban strategists have their way, those forces will face a stiff challenge, not least because of one distinct Taliban advantage: the border between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> barely exists for the Taliban, who are counting on the fact that American forces cannot reach them in their sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Pakistani logistics tactician for the Taliban, a 28-year-old from the country's tribal areas, in interviews with The New York Times, described a Taliban strategy that relied on free movement over the border and in and around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ready recruitment of Pakistani men and sustained cooperation of sympathetic Afghan villagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His account provided a keyhole view of the opponent the Americans and their NATO allies are up against, as well as the workings and ambitions of the Taliban as they prepared to meet the influx of American troops. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also illustrated how the Pakistani Taliban, an umbrella group of many brands of jihadist fighters backed by Al Qaeda, are spearheading wars on both sides of the border in what for them is a seamless conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tactician wears a thick but carefully shaped black beard and a well-trimmed shock of black hair, a look cultivated to allow him to move easily all over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by his fellow Taliban members. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on an array of issues, discussed over six months of interviews with The Times, he  showed himself to be knowledgeable of Taliban activities, and the information he provided  matched up consistently with that of other sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was well informed -- and unconcerned, he said -- of the plans of the head of the United States Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, to replicate in Afghanistan some of the techniques he had used in Iraq to stop the Sunni tribes from fighting the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I know of the Petraeus experiment there,'' he said. ''But we know our Afghans. They will take the money from Petraeus, but they will not be on his side. There are so many people working with the Afghans and the Americans who are on their payroll, but they inform us, sell us weapons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He acknowledged that the Americans would have far superior forces and power this year, but was confident that the Taliban could turn this advantage on its head. ''The Americans cannot take control of the villages,'' he said. ''In order to expel us they will have to resort to aerial bombing, and then they will have more civilian casualties.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The one thing that impressed him were the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- virtually the only American military presence felt inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are very effective,'' he said, acknowledging that they had thinned the top leadership of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the area. He said 29 of his friends had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> simply prompted Taliban fighters to spend more time in Afghanistan, or to move deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, straddling both theaters of a widening conflict. The recruits were prepared to fight where they were needed, in either country, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the fighting now under way in Buner and Dir Districts, in the North-West Frontier Province of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Pakistani Taliban are taking on the Pakistani Army in a battle that is the most obvious front of a long-haul strategy to destabilize and take over a nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, the Pakistani Taliban are directly singling out the United States and NATO forces by sending guerrillas to assist their Afghan Taliban allies in ousting the foreigners from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While to the Taliban those conflicts are one fluid and sprawling war, the border between Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long presented a firm barrier for the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an official ally of the United States, the Pakistanis will not allow American troops to cross the border from Afghanistan. They will also not allow the troops to be present as a fighting force alongside the Pakistani military in the tribal areas that Al Qaeda and the Taliban use as a base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has helped </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan recently open a series of joint posts to share intelligence and improve border monitoring. But those efforts are slight when compared with the demands of a 1,600-mile frontier of unforgiving terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite years of demands by American and NATO commanders for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to control Taliban infiltration, the Taliban tactician said getting his fighters over the border was not a problem. The Pakistani paramilitary soldiers from the Frontier Corps who guard the border were too busy looking after their own survival, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has already begun moving 80 Taliban fighters in four groups stealthily into Afghanistan in the past month to meet the new American forces, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tactician says he embeds his men in what he described as friendly Afghan villages, where they will spend the next four to six months with the residents, who provide the weapons and succor for the missions against American and NATO soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, he made a reconnaissance trip by motorcycle to Paktika Province in Afghanistan from Wana, the main city in South Waziristan, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, to make sure the route was safe for his men. It was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The main task for his first two groups of fighters will be to ambush convoys of NATO goods and soldiers on the Kandahar-Kabul highway, a major supply line for the allied war effort. ''We want to inflict maximum trouble, to lower their morale, to destabilize,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His guerrillas, in their late teens to mid-20s, are handpicked for their endurance and commitment, he said. Some, like him, were trained by the Pakistani government as proxy fighters against India in Kashmir and have now joined the Qaeda and Taliban cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a new twist, cameramen instructed to capture video of faltering American soldiers for propaganda DVDs are increasingly accompanying the guerrillas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tactician, a heavily built man who says he has put on weight in the past two years and is now too heavy and old to fight, said he was loyal to a commander named Mullah Mansoor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In turn, Mr. Mansoor serves under the aegis of Siraj Haqqani, the son of a veteran Afghan mujahedeen leader, Jalaluddin Haqqani. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tactician worked mostly from Wana, where he owns a small business and where, he acknowledged, the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had disrupted life. The threat of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ended the custom of gathering in groups of 10 to 20 men to discuss the issues of the day. ''The gossip has finished,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The relationship between the Pakistani Taliban and Qaeda operatives, most of whom are Arabs, is respectful but distant, according to his descriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Arabs often go to the bazaar in Wana. But they bristle when asked questions, he said. ''They never tell us their activities,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Taliban are willing providers for Al Qaeda. ''When they need a suicide bomber, like blowing up a government building, we provide it,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was respect for the scale of Al Qaeda's ambitions. ''They have a global agenda, they have a big design,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban goal was more narrow. ''Capturing Afghanistan is not an Al Qaeda mission,'' he said. ''It's a Taliban mission. We will be content in capturing Afghanistan and throwing the Americans out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Taliban will fight as long as it takes to defeat the Americans, he said. At the end ofthis fighting season, he said, ''We will have a body count, and we will see who has broken whose back.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama announced his new strategy in March for dealing with the problems of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he declared that America's once-grandiose goals in the region should be narrowed to taking aim at Al Qaeda. To get the job done, he was already sending  upwards of 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and he promised to pour billions of dollars in aid into development programs in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was only one hitch: Al Qaeda doesn't really live in Afghanistan. It survives largely over the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where American boots on the ground will never be tolerated. ''This is the logical flaw in an otherwise pretty sophisticated plan,'' one of the participants in the White House debate said at the time. ''We have to stabilize Afghanistan. But if the goal is to take out Al Qaeda and its friends, we're putting our troops in the wrong country.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But only five weeks later, what seemed like a fissure in the plan  --  a fissure Mr. Obama himself discussed and fully understood, his aides say  --  has opened into a canyon. As Mr. Obama prepares to meet at the White House on Wednesday with President Asif Ali Zardari of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, the agenda has been overwhelmed by the drive that insurgents inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are mounting for control of swaths of the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The original intention for the meeting was to find ways to accomplish something the Pakistanis and the Afghans have never been able to engineer, no matter how hard Washington has pushed them to: A coordinated military effort to squeeze the Taliban and other insurgents on both sides of their long, wild border. Suddenly, that seems like the lesser of two urgent problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The possibility is now real that we will see a jihadist state emerge in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- not an inevitable outcome, not even the most likely, but a real possibility,'' said Bruce Riedel, the Brookings Institution scholar who served as the co-author of Mr. Obama's review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And that is the real strategic nightmare for the United States,'' he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Important as Afghanistan is to the United States, he said, the events of the past few weeks focused American minds on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uniquely toxic cocktail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's where the far greater strategic risks lie,'' said Mr. Riedel, a former intelligence officer who has long navigated the dangerous currents of South Asia. ''It has more terrorists per square mile than anyplace else on earth, and it has a nuclear weapons program that is growing faster than anyplace else on earth.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or, as Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it on Monday, ''this isn't about 'can do' any more; this is about 'must do.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So in the land of no good options, what are some of the possibilities that Mr. Obama can explore? What can he accomplish sitting down with a weak Pakistani leader who spent years dodging charges of corruption, and whose early support in Washington has quickly soured? Or with an even weaker Afghan leader who was once a favorite of the United States  -- both for his elegance and for his eloquence  -- but who many in the Obama administration would now like to see eased out of office in the coming election? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here are a few possibilities to watch for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speed Up Plan A The core of Mr. Obama's strategy was to bet on a long-term solution: Retraining the Pakistani military to become an effective counterinsurgency force and pour billions of dollars and plenty of manpower into real nation-building efforts on both sides of the border, but particularly in the tribal areas that have become Al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds -- in short, to execute the Marshall Plan for the region that President George W. Bush first talked about in March 2002 but never executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to administration officials, Mr. Obama is expected to promise to unlock nearly $1 billion in aid that the United States has promised but not yet delivered, and to announce a new training program for Pakistani soldiers, probably located in Kuwait so that American trainers need not set foot on Pakistani soil. But building schools and training soldiers takes time. And with the Taliban expansion threatening the country's main East-West highway  -- the highway that leads to Islamabad  -- it is not clear that the long-term approach will address the immediate military emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Step up Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Covert Ground Action  Last summer Mr.  Bush approved a covert plan allowing United States forces, for the first time, to use remotely piloted aircraft to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only Al Qaeda sites, but other insurgents that threaten either Afghanistan or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. President Obama continued that policy, but every proposed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has posed a awful choice: How do you blow up a house that has suspected terrorists in the basement if it also has seven-year-olds and their mothers in the living room? The popular anger in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has reached a fever pitch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's aides have debated inviting the Pakistanis to participate in the C.I.A.'s Predator program, actively managing the missions rather than just permitting them to be mounted from a not-so-secret base on Pakistani territory. But many in the administration are hesitant, because past joint operations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and intelligence services have rarely worked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The question is whether the Taliban's boldness has scared the Pakistanis enough to realize that they need our help,'' one national security official involved in the debate said. ''We don't know the answer to that.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is similar concern about sending American special forces on missions deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for fear of the political reaction if they are discovered operating inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> borders. (One of Mr.  Bush's aides put this problem pithily last summer when he asked, ''How do you invade an ally?'') </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Make Nuclear Arms the No. 1 Concern: In public, the administration says that no matter what inroads the Taliban make in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the country's nuclear arsenal is secure. ''The Pakistani leadership and in particular the military is very focused on this,'' Admiral Mullen said on Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But when not speaking on the record, intelligence and administration officials say they cannot rely on vague assurances that the weapons and the nuclear materials are locked down. They worry about a stream of intelligence suggesting sophisticated efforts by Al Qaeda and others to place their sympathizers inside the nuclear infrastructure. (Pakistani officials say they extensively screen the thousands of nuclear workers and weed out anyone suspect. But even in the United States, such programs have failed in the past.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So some officials argue for extending the American program to help secure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons, pressing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to develop joint plans to evacuate those weapons if they came under threat. It is doubtful that the Pakistanis, who fear the United States has secret plans to seize the arsenal, would ever agree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bluntest statement of concern to date came a week ago from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an interview with James Rosen of Fox News. ''If the worst, the unthinkable, were to happen, and this advancing Taliban, encouraged and supported by Al Qaeda and other extremists, were to essentially topple the government for failure to beat them back, then they would have the keys to the nuclear arsenal of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani military pressed its multipronged assault on three Taliban-held districts northwest of the capital, Islamabad, on Saturday, claiming significant gains but also blaming militants for endangering noncombatants by firing indiscriminately and basing themselves in civilian homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As terrified people continued to flee the fighting, the outskirts of the conflict areas are facing a critical need for more shelter and supplies. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has registered more than 120,000 residents displaced from the three contested districts -- Swat, Buner and Dir -- and surrounding areas, and warns that several hundred thousand more are likely to leave as well.  For the moment, most people are able to find their own shelter, renting space or moving in with extended families in urban areas, the agency said, but such options are rapidly diminishing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military statements issued Saturday reported 15 militants killed in helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Swat Valley district capital, Mingora, and as many as 40 militants killed in other parts of the district, news agencies said. Those claims -- and the military's overall count of more than 140 slain insurgents -- are impossible to verify independently,  given that aid agencies and journalists are barred from the conflict areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A provincial official, Iftikhar Hussain, accused the Taliban of causing civilian deaths. ''The militants are using the civilian population as a human shield, and they have dug trenches in civilian areas,'' Mr. Hussain told reporters at a news conference in Peshawar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani held an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday, calling afterward at a news conference for popular support for the military operations. The army ''can only be successful if there is support of the masses,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a nuclear-armed country mired in political and economic crisis, has been deeply divided over its response to the militants, who are still seen in some sectors of the government and military as a secondary threat compared with India and who have actually received some covert support from factions within the intelligence services in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the current government has sought to assure the West that it is taking the militants' advances seriously, the issue has become a great source of tension with the United States, in particular. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the American-led invasion of Afghanistan to oust Al Qaeda and the Taliban, the United States relied on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as its most important regional ally and has given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military more than $1 billion a year since 2001. But the Taliban managed to regroup in the porous border areas between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan and is now spearheading wars in both countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intensified its military campaign to reclaim Swat and neighboring districts last week only under intense pressure from Washington, and after enduring months of a regional power struggle with the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army has estimated that a force of about 4,000 militants took advantage of a peace agreement in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in February to seize control of much of Swat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similar agreements in two areas to the south, the semiautonomous tribal areas of North and South Waziristan, made those regions a ministate for Qaeda and Taliban militants, drawing missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might have helped push the Taliban, and some Qaeda elements, out of the tribal belt and into Swat, making the valley and its neighboring districts more important to the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, Pakistani officials said a new missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in South Waziristan  killed nine people, including six foreign militants, The A.P. reported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Taliban militants push deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> settled areas, foreign operatives of Al Qaeda who had focused on plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West are seizing on the turmoil to sow chaos in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and strengthen the hand of the militant Islamist groups there, according to American and Pakistani intelligence officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One indication came April 19, when a truck parked inside a Qaeda compound in South Waziristan, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, erupted in a fireball when it was struck by a C.I.A. missile. American intelligence officials say that the truck had been loaded with high explosives, apparently to be used as a bomb, and that while its ultimate target remains unclear, the bomb would have been more devastating than the suicide bombing that killed more than 50 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Al Qaeda's leaders -- a predominantly Arab group of Egyptians, Saudis and Yemenis, as well as other nationalities like Uzbeks -- for years have nurtured ties to Pakistani militant groups like the Taliban operating in the mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The foreign operatives have historically set their sights on targets loftier than those selected by the local militant groups, aiming for spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West, but they may see new opportunity in the recent violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence officials say the Taliban advances in Swat and Buner, which are closer to Islamabad than to the tribal areas, have already helped Al Qaeda in its recruiting efforts. The officials say the group's recruiting campaign is currently aimed at young fighters across the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia who are less inclined to plan and carry out far-reaching global </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and who have focused their energies on more immediate targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They smell blood, and they are intoxicated by the idea of a jihadist takeover in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a former analyst for the C.I.A. who recently led the Obama administration's policy review of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It remains unlikely that Islamic militants could seize power in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, given the strength of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military, according to American intelligence analysts. But a senior American intelligence official expressed concern that recent successes by the Taliban in extending territorial gains could foreshadow the creation of ''mini-Afghanistans'' around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that would allow militants even more freedom to plot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American government officials and terrorism experts said that Al Qaeda's increasing focus on a local strategy was partly born from necessity, as the C.I.A.'s intensifying airstrikes have reduced the group's ability to hit targets in the West. The United States has conducted 16 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far this year, according to American officials, compared with 36 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in all of 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a Pakistani intelligence assessment provided to The New York Times in February, Al Qaeda has adapted to the deaths of its leaders by shifting ''to conduct decentralized operations under small but well-organized regional groups'' within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. At the same time, the group has intensified its recruiting, to replace its airstrike casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Al Qaeda's main goals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the assessment said, was to ''stage major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to create a feeling of insecurity, embarrass the government and retard economic development and political progress.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Qaeda operatives are foreigners inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and experts say that the group's leaders, like Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, appear to be wary of claiming credit for the violence in the country, possibly creating popular backlash against the group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are trying to take an Arab face off this,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you look at Al Qaeda as a brand, they know when to broadcast the brand, as the group has done in North Africa,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''And they know when to cloak the brand, as it has done in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, it is difficult for American officials to assess exactly which recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are the work of Qaeda operatives. But intelligence officials say they believe that the Marriott Hotel bombing was partly planned by Usama al-Kini, a Kenyan Qaeda operative who was killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on New Year's Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to Mr. Hoffman, Al Qaeda may  be trying to achieve a separate goal: getting the C.I.A. to call off its campaign of airstrikes in the tribal areas. A wave of terrorist violence could foment so much popular discontent with the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, he said, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might then try to pressure the Obama administration to scale back its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For now, however, Obama administration officials say they believe that the covert airstrikes are the best tool at their disposal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Al Qaeda inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which remains the group's most important haven, but where large numbers of American combat forces would never be welcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The April 19 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that hit what appeared to have been a truck bomb in a compound used by Al Qaeda set off an enormous secondary explosion, intelligence officials say. A second, empty truck destroyed in the same </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may also have been there to be outfitted with explosives, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another significant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on April 29, missiles fired from a C.I.A. Predator killed Abu Sulayman al-Jazairi, an Algerian Qaeda planner who American intelligence officials say they believe helped train operatives for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Europe and the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, officials caution that Al Qaeda has not abandoned its goal of ''spectacular'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and Europe. According to one American counterterrorism official, the group continues to plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outside its sanctuary in the tribal areas, aiming at targets in the West and elsewhere in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are opportunistic to the extent they perceive vulnerabilities with the uncertain nature of Pakistani politics and the security situation in Swat and Buner,'' said the American counterterrorism official, who like other officials interviewed for this article was not authorized to speak publicly on intelligence issues. ''They're trying to exploit it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In meetings this past week in Washington, American and Pakistani officials discussed the possibility of limited joint operations with American Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under one proposal, the United States would retain control over the firing of missiles, but it would share with the Pakistani security forces some sophisticated imagery and communications intercepts that could be relayed to Pakistani combat forces on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C.I.A. officials for months have resisted requests by Mr. Zardari to share the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology. In a television interview broadcast Sunday, the Pakistani leader said he would keep pressing to get his own Predator fleet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've been asking for them, but I haven't got a positive answer as yet,'' Mr. Zardari said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But I'm not giving up.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Pakistani military pressed its campaign to root out Taliban militants from three districts northwest of the capital, a recent poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis did not consider terrorism to be the most important issue facing the country, but instead ranked the economy at the top. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The poll was released Monday by the International Republican Institute, a nonprofit group based in Washington that is affiliated with the Republican Party and promotes democracy abroad. The survey also showed that 81 percent of the respondents said they thought that the country was headed in the wrong direction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most blamed President Asif Ali Zardari, and his approval rating was just 19 percent. But an overwhelming majority still said they preferred an unstable democracy to a military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The poll was taken in March before the Taliban flooded into neighboring districts from their stronghold in the Swat Valley, and before the government opened its campaign to push the militants back. It clearly shows the challenges facing the government as it tries to mobilize Pakistanis behind its fight, particularly as the civilian toll of the campaign widens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistanis have long been reluctant to take on the Taliban, who are fellow Muslims and Pakistanis. The poll, for instance, revealed strong support for the February peace agreement with the Taliban in Swat. Eighty percent said they supported the pact, and 74 percent said they thought the deal would bring peace to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That deal has now fallen apart, with the Taliban and the government blaming each other for its breakdown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rehman Malik, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interior minister, said 700 militants were killed in the last four days of intense fighting -- a much higher figure than the 140 or so reported by the military -- along with 22 government soldiers. While it is clear that the fighting has been heavy, none of the casualty claims could be verified because aid agencies and journalists were barred from the conflict areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past 12 days, more than 360,000 civilians have registered with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as having been displaced by the fighting, said the office, based in Geneva. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The figure brought to more than 900,000 the number of people registered as uprooted in successive waves of fighting in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since August, William Spindler, a spokesman for the refugee office, said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik vowed that the military offensive would continue until the militants were crushed. ''The operation will continue until the last Talib,'' Mr. Malik said, using the singular form of the word Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began the offensive under strong American pressure to reverse advances toward the capital by the Taliban, after the militants entered Buner and Dir, districts adjoining Swat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey pointed to a mixed picture for the government and the United States in trying to draw Pakistanis to their side in taking on extremism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most saw economic issues as the nation's most pressing problems, with only 10 percent saying terrorism, but 69 percent agreed that having the Taliban and Al Qaeda operate in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a serious problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Forty-five percent said they supported fighting the extremists in the tribal areas and the North-West Frontier Province, a high for the poll. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey also showed signs of an increase in the willingness of Pakistanis to cooperate with the United States against extremism, with the number  hitting  37 percent from a low of 9 percent in January 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seventy-four percent agreed that religious extremism was a serious problem in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But 56 percent said they would back Taliban demands to extend Islamic law to other parts of the country, including some major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The most striking thing about the survey is that while 81 percent feel the country is headed in the wrong direction, 77 percent say they wanted to live in a democratic setup,'' said Thomas E. Garrett, regional program director for the Middle East and North Africa for the International Republican Institute. ''I think it is quite an amazing number.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Garrett said in a telephone interview that he was not surprised that economic issues took precedence over terrorism. He said that result was consistent with earlier polls by the institute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey was conducted from March 7 to 30, with 3,500 men and women throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus two percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Zardari's low approval ratings were consistent with an earlier poll by the institute. Asked which leader could most effectively handle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problems, 55 percent chose Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader who served twice as prime minister, while just 9 percent said Mr. Zardari. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PESHAWAR, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Agence France-Presse)  -- A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected to have been controlled by the United States  fired two missiles into a compound in a remote </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal area near the Afghan border and killed up to eight militants on Tuesday, security officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  :''It was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a compound, where militants used to stay before crossing the border or after coming back from Afghanistan. Eight militants were killed,'' said one Pakistani security official on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A top security official said two missiles were fired killing seven to eight militants around 25 kilometres (16 miles) from Wana towards the Afghan border.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani commandos attacked a large group of Taliban fighters on Tuesday in the contested district of Swat, while the number of civilians fleeing the fighting reached 1.3 million, military officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, spokesman for the Pakistani Army, said the operation against the Taliban militants was unfolding successfully, though specific details were scarce. The huge flow of refugees from the area was the best indication that the fighting was heavy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, much of the action against the militants has been carried out from the air. The assault by commandos on the town of Piochar, in northern Swat, was one of the first efforts by Pakistani soldiers to join the fight in large numbers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Piochar is a base for Maulana Fazlullah, one of the principal Taliban warlords who are challenging the government's authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than 700 militants have been killed since the operation began last week, General Abbas said. ''The militants are on the run,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The general's claims are impossible to verify because reporters and other independent observers have been excluded from the area. There was no indication, for instance, that the fight to wrest the district capital, Mingora, from Taliban fighters had begun. Pakistanis reached earlier this week said the militants had retained all the territory they held in Swat when the operation began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The exodus, if it proves to be as large as the government says, would be one of the largest migrations of civilians in the region since the partition of India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1947, when as many as 14 million people left their homes for one of the newly independent countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani government and relief agencies have set up a string of camps and food distribution centers in the area, but not nearly enough to accommodate all the people who need them. On Monday, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani appealed to foreign countries to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deal with the human tide. On Tuesday, the United Nations said it was sending 120 tons of emergency supplies to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help with the flow of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all the turmoil unfolding here, a mood of confidence has settled on Islamabad, the capital, since the operation began last week, not necessarily over the chances of its success, but for what appears to be a change of heart in the Pakistani Army. The army, historically the most influential institution in the country, has for years acquiesced in the advance of the Taliban insurgency, which has taken control not just of the Swat Valley, but also of the vast region known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most shocking surrender occurred in February, when the military, and then the country's civilian leaders, ratified the takeover of Swat by Taliban militants. Under the terms of the peace deal, the government agreed to allow the Taliban to establish Islamic law in the region. But the Taliban fighters, most of them under the leadership of Mr. Fazlullah, continued usurping and attacking the government anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, last month, the Taliban took over Buner, an adjoining district only 60 miles from Islamabad. The conquest shook the central government, as well as the middle and upper classes across the country. It also caused American officials to apply enormous pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ensuing campaign, begun last week, appears to have been prosecuted with a new resolve. Whether that will translate into effective action is unclear, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders have been speaking with a new sense of purpose. In a brief meeting with reporters outside his parliamentary office, Rehman Malik, the interior minister, said the government was prevailing against the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The way they are being beaten, the way their recruits are fleeing, and the way the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army is using its strategy, God willing, the operation will be completed very soon,'' Mr. Malik said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the fighting in Swat unfolded this week, missiles fired by a remotely piloted American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 15 people, suspected of being militants, in a village in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas on Tuesday morning. The missiles, apparently three in all, hit a suspected safe house operated by local militants in Sra Khawra, a village that sits on the border between the tribal agencies of North and South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was confirmed by a Pakistani security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with reporters. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out with the tacit cooperation of the Pakistani government, have become extremely controversial here. Neither the Americans nor the Pakistanis publicly acknowledge that they even take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One reporter working in the area said the militants who were the targets of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had returned from fighting along the Pakistani and Afghan border and were in the village when it was attacked by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States military for the first time has provided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a broad array of surveillance information collected by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flying along the border of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, American military officials said Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is not clear whether the cooperation will continue. While American military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flew a handful of noncombat surveillance missions along the border earlier this spring at the request of the Pakistani government, requests for additional flights abruptly stopped without explanation, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The offer to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a much larger amount of imagery, including real-time video feeds and communications intercepts gleaned by remotely piloted aircraft, was intended to help defuse a growing dispute over how to use the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and which country should control the secret missions flown in Pakistani airspace, American officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In meetings last week with President Obama and other American officials in Washington, Asif Ali Zardari, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, repeated his insistence that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be given its own armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operatives of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the country's tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. But the American intelligence operatives who fly the armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain opposed to joint operations with Pakistani intelligence services, pointing out that past attempts were a failure. Several years ago, American officials gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advance word of planned Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but stopped the practice after the information leaked to militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're going after terrorists plotting directly against the United States and its interests,'' said one American counterterrorism official. ''Nobody wants to gamble with those kinds of targets. We tried a joint approach before, and it didn't work. Those are facts that can't be ignored.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officials said Wednesday that there was no plan to allow the military to join the C.I.A. in operating armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They disputed a report in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been given joint control of armed American military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Obama administration officials are vigorously resisting sharing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology with Pakistani security forces, but officials from both countries said compromises were possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and some Pakistani officials spoke anonymously because the C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operations are classified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said that Mr. Zardari wanted the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology partly to tamp down anger inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the campaign of C.I.A. airstrikes inside the country, which have killed civilians in addition to more than a dozen Qaeda leaders. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had its own Predators, they said, the government in Islamabad could make a more plausible case to the public that Pakistani missiles, not American missiles, were being used to kill militants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concerns about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do not relate to their ability to take out bad guys, they relate to the collateral damage and concerns about national sovereignty,'' said Husain Haqqani, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a compromise, the American military in Afghanistan a few months ago offered to increase the amount of sensitive surveillance information it shared with the Pakistani military. American officials said the information could help Pakistani forces combat an increasingly lethal militancy that was spreading not only in the tribal areas, but also in the settled areas of Swat and Buner, closer to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. American and Pakistani officials said that such information-sharing initiatives could build trust between the security services of both nations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-March, the American military in Afghanistan flew a demonstration mission of a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along a stretch of the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border to show the kind of imagery and communications information the Predator could provide. The Americans transmitted the information to a border coordination center near the Khyber Pass operated by American, Pakistani and Afghan personnel, and the information was sent through Pakistani security databases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The test run went well enough that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> subsequently requested a small number of additional Predator reconnaissance flights to support their operations in the border tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But American officials said the requests for additional surveillance missions ended suddenly in early April. ''There was no reason given, it just stopped,'' said one senior American defense official. American officials suggested that the change could be the result of internal divisions in the Pakistani military over how closely to cooperate with the Americans on intelligence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For its part, the Obama administration has provided the Pakistanis with the surveillance information but has resisted sharing detailed information about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operate. ''This is technology we haven't given to our closest allies -- the Brits or the Australians or NATO,'' said one senior American official who is working on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Infusing this debate is a continuing suspicion by American intelligence officials of the premier Pakistani spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. Because the Predators, and now an even more sophisticated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the Reaper, have been among the most successful weapons against Qaeda and other militant leaders, there is deep concern that any information about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operating patterns, blind spots, and takeoff and landing locations could be leaked to the insurgents and used to take down the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the fighting in Swat unfolded this week, missiles fired by a remotely piloted American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 15 people, suspected of being militants, in a village in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas on Tuesday. The missiles, apparently three in all, hit a suspected safe house operated by local militants in Sra Khawra, a village that sits on the border between the tribal agencies of North and South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the 18th American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far this year, compared with 36 in all of last year. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN recent days, the Pentagon has made two major changes in its strategy to defeat the Taliban, Al Qaeda and their affiliates in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. First came the announcement that Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal would take over as the top United States commander in Afghanistan. Next, Pentagon officials said that the United States was giving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more information on its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on terrorist targets, while news reports indicated that Pakistani officers would have significant future control over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> routes, targets and decisions to fire weapons (though the military has denied that).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While we agree with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that ''fresh eyes were needed'' to review our military strategy in the region, we feel that expanding or even just continuing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war is a mistake. In fact, it would be in our best interests, and those of the Pakistani people, to declare a moratorium on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes into Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, and following much internal debate, President George W. Bush authorized a broad expansion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a wide array of targets within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Qaeda operatives, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based members of the Afghan Taliban insurgency and -- in some cases -- other militants bent on destabilizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in military operations has steadily grown -- we know from public documents that from last September to this March alone, C.I.A. operatives launched more than three dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The appeal of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for policy makers is clear. For one thing, their effects are measurable. Military commanders and intelligence officials point out that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have disrupted terrorist networks in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, killing key leaders and hampering operations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> create a sense of insecurity among militants and constrain their interactions with suspected informers. And, because they kill remotely, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> avoid American casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on balance, the costs outweigh these benefits for three reasons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war has created a siege mentality among Pakistani civilians. This is similar to what happened in Somalia in 2005 and 2006, when similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were employed against the forces of the Union of Islamic Courts. While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did kill individual militants who were the targets, public anger over the American show of force solidified the power of extremists. The Islamists' popularity rose and the group became more extreme, leading eventually to a messy Ethiopian military intervention, the rise of a new regional insurgency and an increase in offshore piracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war from afar and often kills more civilians than militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Press reports suggest that over the last three years </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed about 14 terrorist leaders. But, according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians.  This is 50 civilians for every militant killed, a hit rate of 2 percent -- hardly ''precision.'' American officials vehemently dispute these figures, and it is likely that more militants and fewer civilians have been killed than is reported by the press in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Nevertheless, every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new desire for revenge, and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have increased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, public outrage at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hardly limited to the region in which they take place -- areas of northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where ethnic Pashtuns predominate. Rather, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are now exciting visceral opposition across a broad spectrum of Pakistani opinion in Punjab and Sindh, the nation's two most populous provinces. Covered extensively by the news media, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are popularly believed to have caused even more civilian casualties than is actually the case. The persistence of these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Pakistani territory offends people's deepest sensibilities, alienates them from their government, and contributes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Third, the use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> displays every characteristic of a tactic -- or, more accurately, a piece of technology -- substituting for a strategy. These </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are now being carried out without a concerted information campaign directed at the Pakistani public or a real effort to understand the tribal dynamics of the local population, efforts that might make such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, simply ending the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is no more a strategy than continuing them. Stabilizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will require a focus on securing areas, principally in Punjab and Sindh, that are still under government control, while building up police and civil authorities and refocusing aid on economic development, security and governance. Suspending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't fix </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problems -- but continuing them makes these problems much harder to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Governments typically make several mistakes when attempting to separate violent extremists from populations in which they hide. First, they often overestimate the degree to which a population harboring an armed actor can influence that actor's behavior. People don't tolerate extremists in their midst because they like them, but rather because the extremists intimidate them. Breaking the power of extremists means removing their power to intimidate -- something that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imagine, for example, that burglars move into a neighborhood. If the police were to start blowing up people's houses from the air, would this convince homeowners to rise up against the burglars? Wouldn't it be more likely to turn the whole population against the police? And if their neighbors wanted to turn the burglars in, how would they do that, exactly? Yet this is the same basic logic underlying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy is similar to French aerial bombardment in rural Algeria in the 1950s, and to the ''air control'' methods employed by the British in what are now the Pakistani tribal areas in the 1920s. The historical resonance of the British effort encourages people in the tribal areas to see the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a continuation of colonial-era policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign is in fact part of a larger strategic error -- our insistence on personalizing this conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Devoting time and resources toward killing or capturing ''high-value'' targets -- not to mention the bounties placed on their heads -- distracts us from larger problems, while turning figures like Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group, into Robin Hoods. Our experience in Iraq suggests that the capture or killing of high-value targets -- Saddam Hussein or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- has only a slight and fleeting effect on levels of violence. Killing Mr. Zarqawi bought only 18 days of quiet before Al Qaeda returned to operations under new leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not to suggest that killing terrorists is a bad thing -- on the contrary. But it's not the only thing that matters, and over-emphasizing it wastes resources. The operation that killed Mr. Zarqawi, for example, was not a one-day event. Thousands of hours of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance were devoted to the elimination ofone man, when units on the ground could have used this time to protect the people from the insurgency that was tearing Iraq apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Having Osama bin Laden in one's sights is one thing. Devoting precious resources to his capture or death, rather than focusing on protecting the Afghan and Pakistani populations, is another. The goal should be to isolate extremists from the communities in which they live. The best way to do this is to adopt policies that build local partnerships. Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies must be defeated by indigenous forces -- not from the United States, and not even from Punjab, but from the parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which they now hide. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> make this harder, not easier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two missiles fired from an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft killed at least 25 militants in North Waziristan Province on Saturday, including two Arab fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda, according to a Pakistani intelligence official, a local resident and news reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, a remote-controlled car bomb exploded in a crowded shopping area in the center of the northwestern city of Peshawar on Saturday afternoon, killing at least 11 people, some of them children, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani intelligence official identified one of the Arab men killed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> airstrike as Asad al-Misri but gave no details about his rank or function within Al Qaeda. The name of the second Arab man was not known, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A resident of a village near Sarkai Naki, where the airstrike hit, said most of the dead were Pakistani militants belonging to a group led by Hafiz Gul Bahadar in North Waziristan. The missiles also hit a vehicle and an Islamic school thought to be a training facility for militants, the resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The airstrike on Saturday morning was near where a senior Qaeda commander, Abu Laith al-Libi, was killed by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in January 2008, Pakistani officials said. Officials said it was the 19th </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an American operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American commanders have called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one of the most effective tools against Al Qaeda and the sanctuaries it uses in the tribal areas to stage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American and NATO soldiers in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani government has publicly criticized the airstrikes, which have caused outrage here. But American officials say that the Pakistani government has privately assented to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because of their effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   President Asif Ali Zardari has asked the Obama administration for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could carry out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pakistani government believes it could better justify the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to its citizens if they were carried out by its military, Pakistani officials have said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intelligence officers remain opposed to joint operations of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, largely because of the worry that targeting information would leak to the militants from the Pakistanis, American officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police in Peshawar said that the bombing there on Saturday struck a bus carrying disabled children, killing four of them and at least seven other people.  Dozens of people were reported wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No group claimed responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the Taliban and other armed groups battling the Afghan government are talking to intermediaries about a potential peace agreement, with initial demands focused on a timetable for a withdrawal of American troops, according to Afghan leaders here and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The talks, if not the withdrawal proposals, are being supported by the Afghan government. The Obama administration, which has publicly declared its desire to coax ''moderate'' Taliban fighters away from armed struggle, says it is not involved in the discussions and will not be until the Taliban agree to lay down their arms. But nor is it trying to stop the talks, and Afghan officials believe they have tacit support from the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The discussions have so far produced no agreements, since the insurgents appear to be insisting that any deal include an American promise to pull out -- at the very time that the Obama administration is sending more combat troops to help reverse the deteriorating situation on the battlefield. Indeed, with 20,000 additional troops on the way, American commanders seem determined to inflict greater pain on the Taliban first, to push them into negotiations and extract better terms. And most of the initial demands are nonstarters for the Americans in any case.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, the talks are significant because they suggest how a political settlement  may be able to end the eight-year-old war, and how such negotiations  may proceed. They also raise the prospect of potentially difficult decisions by President Hamid Karzai and President Obama, who may have to consider making deals with groups like the Taliban that are anathema to many Americans, and other leaders with brutal and bloody pasts. Some of the leaders in the current talks have been involved with Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the talks have been under way for months, they have accelerated since Mr. Obama took office and have produced more specific demands, the Afghan intermediaries said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban leaders, through their spokesman, and those of other armed groups publicly deny that they are involved in any negotiations. But several Afghans here and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say they have been talking directly to the Taliban leadership group headed by Mullah Muhammad  Omar, the movement's secretive founder. The council is based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Discussions have also been held with representatives of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a longtime warlord with a record of extreme brutality, and with Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose guerrilla army is based in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Haqqani's group is also known for its ruthlessness and for sending suicide bombers  into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America cannot win this war, and the Taliban cannot win this war,'' Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef, a former Taliban ambassador and one of the intermediaries, said in an interview. ''I have delivered this message to the Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The talks under way now appear to be directed not at individual bands of antigovernment insurgents -- the strategy suggested by President Obama -- but at the leaders of the large movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials insist they are not participating in any talks. ''The U.S. would support such efforts only if Taliban are willing to abandon violence and lay down their arms, and accept Afghanistan's democratically elected government,'' said Ian Kelly, a State Department spokesman. Still, two of the principal intermediaries, Mr. Zaeef  and Daoud Abedi, said they had held extensive discussions with American officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A State Department memo described a single meeting with Mr. Abedi, but said it ended  abruptly  because American officials were not permitted to meet with representatives of Mr. Hekmatyar. There is no independent confirmation of Mr. Zaeef 's claim to have met with Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan officials said they welcomed the talks. ''The government has kept all channels of communication open,'' said Homayun Hamidzada, a spokesman for Mr. Karzai. ''This includes the Taliban and Hekmatyar.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abedi, an Afghan-American businessman from California and a member of Mr. Hekmatyar's political party, the Islamic Party, said he conducted negotiations in March. Guerrillas loyal to Mr. Hekmatyar are battling the Americans in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. His political party still has a wide following in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, Mr. Abedi said he undertook the negotiations -- with Mr. Hekmatyar and with the Taliban leaders -- at the behest of the State Department, a claim that American officials deny. Mr. Abedi said he met several times with American officials in Washington before and after his trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. He declined to say which American diplomats he met, saying, ''I am a Pashtun, and I swore on my honor that I would not reveal the names of the people I met with, so I cannot.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abedi said he hammered out a common set of demands between the Taliban and Mr. Hekmatyar's group. The groups agreed to stop fighting if those conditions were met, Mr. Abedi said. The Taliban's demands seem incompatible with much of Mr. Obama's strategy, which is to substantially weaken the Taliban through a combination of military force and economic development. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor did the deal Mr. Abedi described mention either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri, the two senior Qaeda leaders  believed to be hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the protection of the Taliban or some other armed group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first demand was an immediate pullback of American and other foreign forces to their bases, followed by a cease-fire and a total withdrawal from the country over the next 18 months. Then the current government would be replaced by a transitional government made up of a range of Afghan leaders, including those of the Taliban and other insurgents. Americans and other foreign soldiers would be replaced with a peacekeeping force drawn from predominantly Muslim nations, with a guarantee from the insurgent groups that they would not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such a force. Nationwide elections would follow after the Western forces left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Mr. Hekmatyar, Mr. Abedi said that he maintained a ''direct link'' with him, and that he was authorized to negotiate on his behalf. He did not meet with Afghan government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the agreement between the Taliban and the Islamic Party was reached, Mr. Abedi said, the Taliban leaders added more conditions: an end to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, and the  release of some Taliban prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abedi said that when he returned to the United States with his proposal, he was greeted with enthusiasm by officials at the State Department. But he said they never called him back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hekmatyar earned a reputation as an especially brutal commander in the civil war that engulfed the country in the 1990s, in particular for the relentless bombardment of Kabul between 1994 and 1996 that killed an estimated 40,000 civilians during an attempt to capture the capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2002, after Mr. Hekmatyar resisted the American invasion, the Americans tried to kill him with a missile fired from a  remotely piloted airplane. They missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other main negotiation is led by Mr. Zaeef  and Arsallah Rahmani, a former Taliban minister and now a member of the Afghan Parliament. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not talking to low-ranking people -- we are talking to the leaders,'' Mr. Rahmani said in an interview. Mr. Zaeef  was the Taliban's ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; he served nearly four years in American military prisons, including the one at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their plan would be for the guerrillas and the government to reconcile slowly, starting with the least contentious issues. One of the main low-level demands of the opposition leaders is that their names be removed from a so-called blacklist, contained in a resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council, which obliges governments to detain them. More difficult issues would follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Blood begets blood, but talking begets peace,'' Mr. Rahmani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zaeef  said the public declarations of Mullah Omar, who usually vows to fight on, are not necessarily to be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A policy can have many faces,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAHORE, Pakistan  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suicide attackers spraying gunfire rammed a carload of explosives into a building housing a police emergency response unit here on Wednesday, killing at least 23 people in what officials said was a failed attempt to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the nearby provincial headquarters of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful intelligence agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost 300 people were wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which took place in broad daylight in one of the busiest districts of Lahore. The assault underscored that militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now feel emboldened to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> far from their traditional strongholds in the lawless regions bordering Afghanistan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said that at least two of the attackers appeared to have died in the blast and that three suspects were detained. Some witnesses reported sustained gunfire after the explosion, indicating that at least one gunman might have escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several army and intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said they believed that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was aimed at the local command center of the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier spy agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have been in reprisal for the Pakistani Army's campaign against Taliban militants in the northwestern Swat Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I believe that anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elements, who want to destabilize our country and see defeat in Swat, have now turned to our cities,'' Mr. Malik told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomb left a crater 8 feet deep and 20 feet wide, and the blast was heard for miles around. Dozens of vehicles were crumpled like paper, and broken glass filled the street. The building of the police-run rescue service collapsed after taking the brunt of the blast, and emergency workers struggled for hours to pull out the dead and wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fahim Jahanzaib, a rescue services official, placed the death toll at 23, with more than 294 wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The dead included 14 policemen and a colonel belonging to the intelligence agency, according to an intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is quite apparent that the ISI was the target,'' the official said, calling the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a ''brazen and well thought-out plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the third </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in three months in or near Lahore, which is the capital and cultural hub of Punjab, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous and affluent province. Earlier </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provoked official fears that Taliban insurgents had teamed up with local militants, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, suspected of conducting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mumbai, India, in November that killed at least 163 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, a white car containing three or four attackers drove toward the rear entrance of the ISI building about 10:15 a.m., according to officials and witnesses. One man jumped out and began to spray gunfire at the police and security personnel guarding the area, said a witness, Ikram Rabbani, who works in a nearby store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unable to get through the building's security barrier, the driver changed course and rammed into the neighboring building, which housed the police-run ambulance service. The building, made of brick, collapsed, shrouding the neighborhood in dust. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rabbani said he heard a small explosion followed by a second powerful blast. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They couldn't get through,'' the intelligence official said. ''So, the second-best option was to hit the building right next to the sector headquarters.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immediately after the explosion, army troops poured out of the heavily fortified office of the intelligence agency. Security forces took up position on nearby rooftops, and a helicopter hovered above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No group immediately took responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but the suspicion of many Pakistani officials fell on Taliban militants seeking vengeance for the army's current push into the Swat Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a possibility that this is a retaliatory blast,'' said Farahnaz Ispahani, a presidential spokeswoman. ''Unfortunately, the public will have to stand very strong and united because we are fighting a very powerful and ideologically driven enemy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has been pressing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to move against the militants to undermine their support for the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan. Gen. David H. Petraeus, head of the Central Command, was in the capital, Islamabad, to meet Pakistani leaders when the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> happened, Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ISI is a powerful body that has long been mistrusted by American officials, who accuse some of its members of harboring sympathies for the Taliban and Al Qaeda. But it has been the repeated target of militants, some of whom suspect ISI agents of helping the Central Intelligence Agency pinpoint the coordinates for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on insurgents close to the Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maryam Kazmi, 25, who lives in the neighborhood, said she was watching television when the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred. ''The ground shook, and all the windows of my room flew open,'' she said. ''The air-conditioner's frame fell on my bed. ''It was so loud that I had to cover my ears.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The explosion was one of a series of recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Lahore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, eight people were killed in the city in a commando-style </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Sri Lankan cricket team. Later in March, militants hit several hundred police cadets  during a morning drill at their academy in a village near Lahore, killing at least eight recruits and instructors.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top American diplomat for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Richard C. Holbrooke, said Friday that he would reinvigorate efforts to trace the sources of financing for the Taliban insurgency, with special scrutiny of private donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke said that private donors, including some from Persian Gulf countries, were increasingly believed to be a far more important source of money for the Taliban than even the opium trade, which the United Nations estimates to be about $300 million a year. An American official responsible for Afghanistan said Friday that the opium money was believed to make up less than half of Taliban financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In the past there was a kind of a feeling that the money all came from drugs in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''That is simply not true.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Identifying the sources of money for the Taliban has been one of the most elusive goals for the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, but the task is central to the American war effort in Afghanistan, and to fighting militancy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But American officials have had limited success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We want to focus on where the money really comes from,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''I will be adding a member of the Treasury Department to my staff within two weeks so we can focus more heavily on this area.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intelligence officials have expressed concerns about financing for terrorism from gulf countries in the past, but Mr. Holbrooke's remarks indicate that the United States may now seek to put more pressure on the countries to stanch the flow of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke at a news conference in Islamabad at the end of a three-day visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intended to highlight the refugee crisis that has spilled out of Swat and Buner, parts of the North-West Frontier Province, where the Pakistani Army has undertaken a campaign to drive out Taliban insurgents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly before he spoke, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban threatened last week to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in major cities in retaliation for the army's offensive. This bombing took place in a remote area, Upper Dir, near the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber tried to enter the main mosque of a village, Hayagai Sharqi,  during Friday Prayer, according to a villager, Umar Rahman. The bomber was stopped at the entrance, and he blew himself up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has supported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military campaign, as have a growing number of Pakistanis. But it is unclear how long Pakistanis' support will last, and how committed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and political leaders are to taking on militant groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This week, a Pakistani court freed the founder of a banned militant group suspected of being linked to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year in Mumbai, India, that left 163 people dead. American and Indian officials condemned the move. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, the militant, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, delivered an inflammatory sermon at a compound in Lahore belonging to Jamaat-ud-Dawa, an Islamic charity that fronts for the banned group, Lashkar-e-Taiba. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He criticized the United States and India, saying Islam would eventually triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Saeed brought up President Obama's speech to the Muslim world on Thursday, saying Mr. Obama was showing ''double standards'' by trying to use stories about his background to woo Muslims.  Mr. Saeed said Mr. Obama must withdraw from Afghanistan and stop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''We don't want any power or hegemony, except wishing that Obama and his country should also embrace Islam,'' Mr. Saeed said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's speech in Cairo last Thursday was ''soft spoken and eloquent,'' said Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical Iraqi cleric, grudgingly, since he also said he despised it. It was a speech that meant different things to different people, a quality that has been much noted in this president. He supported Israel, but reached out to the Muslim world in an unprecedented way. Some friends were troubled, others reassured. Some of America's enemies denounced it, but none dismissed it. Not even the arch-enemies at whom, in some important way, the speech was directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just the day before, in fact, a pre-emptive audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden warned his followers not to trust whatever Mr. Obama would say. And as it turned out, his fear was justified. In the view of Fawaz Gerges, the president's speech was above all else about the war on terror, a direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Mr. bin Laden and the mindset he promulgates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Barack Obama is not just trying to reach out to Muslims for the sake of it,'' says Mr. Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Sarah Lawrence College and an authority on modern jihad. ''He's trying to hammer a deadly nail in Osama bin Laden's message.'' What President Obama understood more than his predecessors, Mr. Gerges says, is that it is not a war that can be won militarily, but only ideologically. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jarret Brachman, a former West Point terrorism expert and author of a recent book, ''Global Jihadism,'' said the speech ''was the most important strategic step we've taken in this war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's why Al Qaeda is so nervous,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the medium were the message, the contrasts could not have been more stark. The American president was polished and poised, his speech broadcast from the elegant surroundings of an ancient Arab university, and watched worldwide. Mr. bin Laden's was on an audiotape, crackling and hard to hear, broadcast on Al Jazeera. ''Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri have been reduced to a static voice on the radio, a static voice on TV and a static image and message,'' Mr. Gerges says. ''The message no longer resonates with Muslims the way it did in the late 90s and after 2001.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Has the message from Al Qaeda just become fossilized, a missive from a coelacanth that no longer dares venture out of its deep sea cave, where it slakes its predatory appetites in the dark? ''We have to put this in a little bit of perspective,'' says Shibley Telhami, a University of Maryland professor who runs an annual poll of Arab public opinion. ''Bin Laden still has some support, his intense admirers, but the real difference is that the rest of the Muslim world were embracing him out of anger toward America, and now they're not.'' The anger toward America remains, but most people have rejected Al Qaeda as well, Mr. Telhami says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's speech referenced the future, quoted from the three major monotheistic religions, and talked about a new beginning, all delivered with his customary calm. The two voices of Al Qaeda were strident, almost violently so, in their discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Be aware that the dogs of Afghanistan have found the flesh of your soldiers to be delicious, so send thousands after thousands to them,'' Mr. Zawahiri taunted Mr. Obama, according to a transcript of his audio message distributed by SITE, which monitors and translates jihadi Web sites. ''America has put on a new face but its heart is full of hate.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contrast with Mr. Obama's central message is luminous. ''There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another and to seek common ground,'' the president said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Telhami was among experts on the region whom the White House consulted during the preparation of Mr. Obama's speech. To the extent that it made the American president more credible to Muslims, it proved a success, he says. ''But that raises expectations even higher,'' he said, ''and with every new speech in the future people are going to expect more beef.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Flagg Miller, a linguistic anthropologist at the University of California at Davis who has studied hundreds of orations attributed to Mr. bin Laden, said, ''Obama's discourse is far more about building consensus and bin Laden's is more polarizing.'' He cautioned, however, not to count Mr. bin Laden out in the war of words. What many in the West overlook, he says, is Mr. bin Laden's effective use of poetry in his speeches; many young Muslims find that appealing, and it confers on him an air of virtue among some elders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Osama bin Laden is himself a poet, some say a good one, with a persuasive mastery of classical Arabic. His imagery leaps out from the 12th century, dripping with blood and featuring steeds carrying warriors wielding swords and lances. It yearns for a time when Muslims did battle with Crusaders, and for the most part won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His poetry is didactic,'' Mr. Miller says, ''always with a political message, but sometimes very moving.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the pre-rebuttal to the American president, the bin Laden voice ends with a poem extolling sacrifice against a more powerful foe, including these lines, translated by Mr. Miller:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And over hellfire growing middle aged Clothed in raiment of sadness that never leave them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It might have been a description of Osama bin Laden himself, dodging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Waziristan. He may still be a menace to society, but his image is no longer on T-shirts peddled in the casbahs. A few years ago he could have beaten the king of Saudi Arabia in a fair election; now, according to a poll, 88 percent of Saudis want their government to crack down on Qaeda followers in their land. And here in Iraq, Sunnis have run their own Qaeda clone out of most of the country, having grown disgusted by the militants' preference for civilian targets, as well as by their puritanical interpretation of Islam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spurned in much of its Arab heartland, Al Qaeda lately has shifted its attentions to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where it still enjoys high approval ratings, bringing the suicide bomb to its old allies the Taliban. ''It's an easy thing to say that bin Laden is feeling increasingly marginalized, and support in the Mideast for Al Qaeda's aims is at an all-time low, but new clusters of Arab militants are re-gathering in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Miller said. Significantly, Mr. bin Laden's audio statement last week focused on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts, approved of by President Obama, to drive the Taliban out of Swat Valley, less than a day's drive from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capital and its main nuclear research laboratories. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's worrisome, but not as much as it would have been in the Bush era, when 49 percent of Saudis told pollsters they admired their errant countryman, offers of marriage poured in to him, and Osama at one point was the first name of choice for newborn boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In those days, there was a joke commonly heard among Muslims that went like this: George Bush and Tony Blair are in a corner at a G-8 conference, laughing at a private joke. Condoleezza Rice comes up and asks what it was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were just discussing World War III,'' says Mr. Blair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would kill a billion Muslims and one dentist,'' says Mr. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why a dentist?'' asks Ms. Rice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''See,'' says Mr. Bush to Mr. Blair, ''I told you no one would care about the Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not the sort of joke that seems likely now to stick to Barack Obama; his Cairo speech may not succeed in changing the Middle East, but it will at least have persuaded many skeptical Muslims that hecared.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials say they are seeing the first evidence that dozens of fighters with Al Qaeda, and a small handful of the terrorist group's leaders, are moving to Somalia and Yemen from their principal haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. In communications that are being watched carefully at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency, the terrorist groups in all three locations are now communicating more frequently, and apparently trying to coordinate their actions, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some aides to President Obama attribute the moves to pressure from intensified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Qaeda operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, after years of unsuccessful American efforts to dislodge the terrorist group from their haven there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are other possible explanations. Chief among them is the growth of the jihadist campaigns in both Somalia and Yemen, which may now have some of the same appeal for militants that Iraq did after the American military invasion there in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Somalia is now a failed state that bears some resemblance to Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while Yemen's weak government is ineffectually trying to combat the militants, American officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen, and there is no evidence that the top leaders -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri -- are considering a move from their refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than half a dozen senior administration, military and counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most officials would not comment on the record about the details of what they are seeing, because of the sensitivity of the intelligence information they are gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, said in remarks here on Thursday that the United States must prevent Al Qaeda  from creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The steady trickle of fighters from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could worsen the chaos in Somalia, where an Islamic militant group, the Shabab, has attracted hundreds of foreign jihadists in its quest to topple the weak moderate Islamist government in Mogadishu. It could also swell the ranks of a growing menace in Yemen, where militants now control large  areas of the country outside the capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am very worried about growing safe havens in both Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in remarks at the Brookings Institution here on May 18. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the United States, the movement creates opportunities as well as risks. With the Obama administration focusing its fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a shift of fighters and some leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a lasting blow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Qaeda and Taliban forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom they have deep familial and tribal ties. A move away from those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal, while communications among militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Somalia and Yemen have created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication devices shortly after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to avoid detection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Obama administration official attributed some of the movement to ''the enormous heat we've been putting on the leadership and the mid-ranks'' with Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched from both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's strategy so far has been to intensify many of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> begun under the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are starting to see the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a tough place to be,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ''It is likely that a small number have left the region as a result. Among these individuals, some have probably ended up in Somalia and Yemen, among other places. The Al Qaeda terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are predominantly foot soldiers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on their way out of the tribal areas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But American officials say there is  evidence of a shift. One senior American military official who follows Africa closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years. Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives and confederates in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yemen and Somalia had stepped up communications with one another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What really has us worried is that they're communicating with each other much more -- Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Somalia and Yemen,'' the senior military officer said. ''They're asking, 'What do you need? Financing? Fighters?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> placed the defeat of Al Qaeda as the No. 1 objective, largely to make sure that the group could not plot new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus, the movement of the fighters, and the disruption that causes, has been interpreted by some of the president's top advisers as a sign of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the emergence of new havens, from which Al Qaeda and its affiliates could plot new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raises difficult questions for the United States on how to combat the growing threat, and creates the possibility that increased missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are in the offing in Yemen and Somalia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Those are issues that I think the international community is going to have to address because Al Qaeda is not going away,'' Admiral Mullen told a Senate committee on May 21. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. says its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have disrupted Al Qaeda's operations and damaged the group's senior ranks. American officials say that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed 11 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders in the past year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al Qaeda has been hit by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it has generated a lot of insecurity among them,'' said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Many among them are uneasy and it is possible that they are leaving for Somalia and other jihadi battle fronts,'' he said. ''The hard core, however, will like to stay on.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without singling out any countries, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the head of the Special Operations Command, spoke in general terms last week about how the increased Pakistani military operations in the Swat Valley and early indications of a new Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan had put militants on the run. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As the Pakistanis are applying pressure,'' Admiral Olson told a House panel, ''it will shift some of the sanctuaries to other places.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESHAWAR, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been fighting militants for weeks in a green valley north of the capital. Even as that battle is fought, it is now gearing up for the most decisive test of the war, in the rugged western mountains that are the Taliban's prime sanctuary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The area, South Waziristan, presents the toughest challenge for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in its fight to curb its growing insurgency. It is home to Baitullah Mehsud, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enemy No. 1, who leads the Taliban here and has engineered dozens of suicide bombings in recent years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud now has thousands of fighters entrenched in mountain terrain that is nearly impossible for conventional armies to navigate, and past efforts to capture him, most recently last year, have failed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is more, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is fighting the Taliban in several areas already and has committed 22,000 troops to its campaign in the valley, called Swat. While military officials say troop strength is not a problem, more forces will be needed to hold newly taken areas, which have gone unpatrolled for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''South Waziristan will be a very hard nut to crack,'' said Talat Masood, a military analyst and retired Pakistani general. ''It is the mother of all problems.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's here that the real battle for the soul of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be fought,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud has often hidden in plain sight -- even holding well-attended news conferences -- fueling suspicions that the government has not been serious about killing or capturing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this time is different, analysts and officials say. The military is buoyed by a level of public support and political consensus that it never had before. In the Swat Valley last year, timidity, half measures and limited patrols left the military bogged down in more than a year of fighting. It finally agreed to cede the area to the Taliban in February. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Taliban took yet another district, the military finally fought back last month, displacing millions of civilians, but also putting the Taliban on the defensive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Waziristan, the challenge is similar, if much harder. A succession of peace deals over the years have allowed Mr. Mehsud and his supporters to dig themselves securely into some of the most rugged terrain in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Virtually the only pressure on Mr. Mehsud and his supporters and allies, which include elements of Al Qaeda, has been applied by missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by remotely piloted American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in recent weeks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has started quietly applying pressure, bombing suspected hide-outs in three areas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that a United States Defense Department official called the beginning of the next phase of the campaign against the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, flew over the region and said Mr. Mehsud ''must be eliminated.'' The army has choked off roads. A heavy equipment dealer from the area said his company had not been able to buy diesel for three weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're shaping the environment,'' said a senior Pakistani military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give details about operations. ''Choking the routes. Control of exit and entrance. Regulating the movement. Checking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, a local official announced that the government had given the go-ahead for an offensive, but a military spokesman on Monday declined to provide details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another, more fundamental shift may also be afoot. Mr. Mehsud killed many tribal elders to amass power in his domain, and officials say he has alienated so many people that some are now turning against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military has begun trying to exploit a rift within the Taliban itself to further isolate him, analysts said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If someone skinned Baitullah Mehsud alive, no one would cry in this country,'' said an official based in Peshawar, the regional capital, who helps oversee the area. ''The environment that made Baitullah is no more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One such faction is led by two of Mr. Mehsud's former allies: Qari Zainuddin and Turkestan Bhaitani. Residents in the towns where they are strong say the group has killed as many as 30 people loyal to Mr. Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a sign of their strength, and of Mr. Mehsud's waning influence in their area, the group met with several hundred tribesmen near Mr. Mehsud's area last week. ''Last year that would have been impossible,'' said a local journalist who covered the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military denies giving any support to the group, but a spokesman for the group said in a telephone interview on Sunday that it received modest financing from the government, through a religious donations fund, Zakat. He said the group had about 2,000 members. Although it opposes Mr. Mehsud, the spokesman said, it supports the Taliban's war against the Americans in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are against Baitullah Mehsud and we want to finish him,'' said the spokesman, who identified himself as Tufan Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fighters loyal to Baitullah Mehsud have been moving into the area from elsewhere in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fortify it. Commanders are dividing responsibilities, designating fighters for bomb making and remote detonation, said a fighter who spoke by telephone from the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's a high level of preparation going on in all of South Waziristan,'' he said. Even in Wana, a town outside Mr. Mehsud's area, the roads were so heavily mined that many preferred to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fighters said the Taliban recently shut down courts they operated in the area, telling those who needed disputes resolved to come back in two months, because those who staffed them were now focused on fighting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An associate of Mr. Mehsud said that the Taliban had the advantage of geography. ''We are up,'' he said, chopping the air above his head with the side of his hand, ''and they are down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if the military prevails, that will be only the beginning. The area is one of the country's poorest, a condition that has made it ripe for militancy. A more lasting solution would require economic opportunity and government support, including an adequate police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Bajaur, part of the tribal areas, the military cleared out militants last year, at great cost to civilians, but the militants have reasserted control. The reason, said Mr. Masood, the military analyst, is that a local government was never properly established. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That held a lesson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Militancy is like a monster,'' said Habibullah Khan, a top bureaucrat for the tribal areas. ''Even if only the tail is left, it will grow again from there.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen people were killed and several wounded Thursday in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected to have been carried out by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the camp of a local Taliban commander in South Waziristan, a Pakistani intelligence official based in the area said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The remotely piloted aircraft fired four missiles into a compound in the village of Raghzai,  near Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, which was being used as a base by the Taliban commander Wali Mohammed, local residents and officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been flying over the Wana area for a day, local residents said, prompting most of the Taliban there to vacate their bases and training camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mohammed, who is also known as Malang Wazir, was not in the compound, a fighter loyal to him said in a telephone interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to residents in the area, in an initial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two missiles hit the compound, killing one person. When people rushed to the scene to rescue the wounded, two more missiles struck, killing eight, the residents said. The intelligence official, who like the fighter spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that four other people had died. One of the dead, the intelligence official said, was a nephew of Mr. Mohammed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani government official reached in Wana said that the Taliban had cordoned off the area of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and were still recovering bodies from the debris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been 22 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far this year, according to local residents and Pakistani officials, compared with 36 last year. The aircraft are operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, which has a standard policy of not commenting on whether an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place. Because the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often kill civilians, they are deeply unpopular among local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have slowed over the past month, as the Pakistani government forces have stepped up their fighting in the Swat Valley and other areas and have begun their own airstrikes in South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mohammed was a member of the local Taliban consultative body that wields de facto control over Wana under a Taliban commander named Maulvi Nazir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local residents said that in recent months, as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Taliban in the area had intensified, Mr. Nazir and his fighters entered a mutual security agreement with Baitullah Mehsud, the powerful Taliban commander who controls much of South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud is responsible for dozens of suicide bombings and is a major target in the Pakistani government's widening offensive against Taliban militants in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Peace deals over the years have allowed him and his supporters to dig securely into some of the most rugged terrain in the country. Analysts said they believed that this latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could push Mr. Nazir closer to Mr. Mehsud and make it more difficult for the military to defeat them. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An airstrike believed to have been carried out by a United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed at least 60 people at a funeral for a Taliban fighter  in South Waziristan on Tuesday, residents of the area and local news reports said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Details of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which occurred in Makeen, remained unclear, but the reported death toll was exceptionally high. If the reports are indeed accurate and if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be the deadliest since the United States began using the aircraft to fire remotely guided missiles at members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The United States carried out 22 previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year, as the Obama administration has intensified a policy inherited from the Bush administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday, the Pakistani Army and Air Force had begun operations in South Waziristan against the forces of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud. The group's suicide bombings in major cities have terrorized Pakistanis for years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a serious blow to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort, on Tuesday an assassin loyal to Mr. Mehsud shot and killed a rival tribal leader, Qari Zainuddin, whom the government had hoped to use as an ally in its campaign to corner the Taliban leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The killing called into question the government's strategy of exploiting tribal fissures in order to defeat Mr. Mehsud and was apparently intended to serve as a reminder that there were serious consequences for crossing him, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It tells people, if you side with the government, this is what will happen to you,'' said Talat Masood, a retired general and a military analyst. ''It says the government can't give you protection, but the other side can.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army, which is already involved in operations against Taliban strongholds in the Swat Valley and other areas, would now have to rely more on its own soldiers to take on the Taliban in South Waziristan as well, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zainuddin was killed in the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan, said Iqbal Khan, the town's district police chief, and the tribal leader's death revealed the tenuous hold of his splinter group in the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The initial investigation, the police chief said, indicated that the shooting was carried out by a guard named Gulbadin Mehsud, who may have infiltrated Mr. Zainuddin's ranks and escaped after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another guard was wounded in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, Mr. Zainuddin and his group had helped the government by denying Baitullah Mehsud and his fighters the ability to operate in the region, killing about 30 of Mr. Mehsud's fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he was in his 30s, Mr. Zainuddin was part of Mr. Mehsud's tribe. However, Mr. Zainuddin split with Mr. Mehsud and joined forces with Turkestan Bhaitani, an older Taliban fighter who had switched sides to ally with the government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two men had held a jirga, or tribal meeting, this month with as many as 100 elders of the Mehsud tribe in the town of Tank in an effort to rally opposition to Mr. Mehsud. Officially, the Pakistani military denies supporting the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zainuddin was selected as successor to Abdullah Mehsud, a top Taliban militant who died in 2007 as security forces raided a hide-out in Baluchistan Province. Mr. Zainuddin had claimed that he had the ability to take on Baitullah Mehsud with the support of 3,000 fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Baitullah Mehsud is not involved in jihad because Islam does not allow suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which his group is perpetrating,'' Mr. Zainuddin was quoted as saying in an interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some reports in the local news media have also suggested that Mr. Mehsud killed Mr. Zainuddin's father years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani jets have aimed at Mr. Mehsud's hide-outs in recent days, and the funeral in Makeen that was hit on Tuesday was being held for a Taliban commander killed that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the funeral may have been conducted by the Pakistani Air Force, residents and local news reports uniformly attributed it to a United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The dead may have included top commanders for Mr. Mehsud. The Geo Television Network, quoting unnamed sources, said that the dead included a trainer of suicide bombers named Qari Hussain as well as a Taliban commander named Sangeen, though there was no way to immediately verify the report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another television channel, AAJ, put the death toll at 60 and said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was carried out by a guided missile. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a funeral in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas missed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, by hours on Tuesday, a Pakistani security official said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud was not present at the time of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but had gone to pay his respects to a Taliban commander killed in another American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earlier the same day, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the funeral appeared to have included only two midlevel Taliban leaders among the scores killed, it presented a clear blow to Mr. Mehsud's operation, showing the deadly proximity of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to his areas and even the possibility that he was a target. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has stepped up its operations against Mr. Mehsud and his followers in South Waziristan, mostly with airstrikes of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani police official speculated that the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have been coordinated with Pakistani officials, but could not confirm it. A Pakistani intelligence official, however, said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been coordinating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the Americans for several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past, most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were focused around Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, and directed at targets that posed an immediate threat to the United States. These included foreign members of Al Qaeda or Taliban commanders who helped coordinate cross-border </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently, however, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have seemed to home in on Mr. Mehsud and his groups, which have posed a growing threat to the security of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through scores of suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The apparent switch follows months of public and private complaints by Pakistani officials that the Americans were interested in using the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only against individuals who threatened their own security interests in Afghanistan and beyond, not militants like Mr. Mehsud who had struck inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That may be changing. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which are operated remotely from the United States, carried out two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mr. Mehsud's area in South Waziristan on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit a compound in Ladha, a village in the mountains of western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is Mr. Mehsud's sanctuary. It killed Khwazh Wali, a Taliban leader who was a close aide to Mr. Mehsud, and three others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later Tuesday, Mr. Wali's body was taken for burial to the village of Zangara, east of Makeen, where people, apparently including Mr. Mehsud, went to pay tribute to the Taliban fighter. It was unclear how long after Mr. Mehsud had left the village that the second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent three missiles hurtling into the large crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Estimates of the number of dead varied. One security official said that as many as 80 people had been killed, but a local resident in a nearby town said the number was closer to 50. Pakistani television reported that more than 100 had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A resident supportive of Mr. Mehsud said by telephone from the area that none of the most senior leaders of Mr. Mehsud's group had been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though Pakistani television networks reported widely that top commanders, including Qari Hussein and Sangeen Zadran, the Afghan commander close to Mr. Mehsud, had been killed, the resident in the area denied those men had been at the funeral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their deaths would have represented a serious blow to the Taliban, which relies on Mr. Hussein's expertise to train suicide bombers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the highest ranking Taliban commander killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the funeral appeared to a leader known as Commander Bilal. He was in charge of Mr. Mehsud's Shabi Khel tribe and a central figure in the Taliban movement, according to a Mehsud Taliban fighter who spoke by telephone on Wednesday evening. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> escalates military operations against a top Taliban leader, the United States has resumed secret military surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights over the country's tribal areas to provide Pakistani commanders with a wide array of videos and other information on militants, according to American and Pakistani officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sharing of real-time video feeds, communications intercepts and other information with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military is considered essential in the country's campaign to help hunt down the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, and destroy his hideouts and forces in the country's northwest, the officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increased intelligence cooperation comes as the Obama administration is also speeding the delivery of transport helicopters, body armor and other equipment that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military has requested to help combat Mr. Mehsud and to prepare for a major offensive in the militant leader's stronghold in South Waziristan, a mountainous region abutting the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The noncombat surveillance flights along the border are different from the flights of armed C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have attacked several Taliban targets in recent months and days. Last Tuesday, an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a funeral in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas missed Mr. Mehsud by hours, a Pakistani security official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Responding to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> renewed request for sophisticated surveillance information gets around, at least for the moment, the tensions surrounding the administration's refusal to grant repeated requests by President Asif Ali Zardari of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that his country be given its own armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fighters of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the mountainous tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intelligence operatives who conduct the armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain opposed to joint operations with Pakistani intelligence services, pointing out that past attempts were  failures. Several years ago, American officials gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advance word of planned Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but stopped the practice after the information was leaked to militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the intelligence-sharing arrangement, which resumed in the past few weeks but has not previously been made public, Pakistani ground forces receive direct support for several hours a day, though not necessarily every day, from remotely piloted American military aircraft based in Afghanistan, a senior American defense official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The agreement allows the Pakistani military to request that the American military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fly noncombat surveillance missions over certain swaths of territory in South Waziristan where it suspects militant activity, the American official said. Video feeds from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are relayed to a joint coordination center at a border crossing at the Khyber Pass, where a Pakistani military team monitors the video and sends it to command centers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There has been a lot of improvement in I.S.R.-related U.S. support to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said a senior Pakistani security official, referring to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. But, he acknowledged, the technical connections have not been completely worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials are still installing equipment to enhance and expand the flow of information from the joint coordination center to Pakistani security databases across the border, the Pakistani official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Pakistani commanders have used the surveillance and communications information from the American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to track cross-border movements of militants and to monitor specific areas for insurgent activity that can be attacked by Pakistani helicopter gunships or F-16 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani and American militaries agreed to the surveillance flights earlier this year as a way to lend American technology to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts against militants. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missions were also seen as an incremental step in building trust between two militaries long suspicious of each other's motives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistanis authorized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missions over Bajaur and surrounding locations near the Afghan border, but the requests ended abruptly when Pakistani troops launched offensives in Swat and Buner, areas deep inside Pakistani territory just dozens of miles from Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials worried about the risks of flying American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far from the border, and they feared that if a Predator were shot down or crashed, it might set off public anger about American involvement in domestic Pakistani matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, with Pakistani troops preparing for an offensive in South Waziristan, these concerns have receded and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missions have resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials said that the intelligence sharing has helped in going after Mr. Mehsud's fighters and confederates. They said that American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operators were now concentrating on militants who were of interest to the Pakistanis, like Mr. Mehsud, and not just foreign fighters and Al Qaeda operatives who posed more of a direct threat to the United States and American interests abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spokesmen for the White House's National Security Council, Defense Department and United States Central Command declined to comment for this article. Four American and Pakistani officials provided general details of the military surveillance flights, but only on condition of anonymity because of the continuing operations and because the United States remains very unpopular in Pakistani public opinion polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama's national security adviser, James L. Jones, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, have visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently to discuss security arrangements. Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is expected in the next several days to make his fourth trip to the region since assuming his role earlier this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials say that they have continued to express frustration in private that the United States is not sharing the targets of the armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in advance -- revealing lingering distrust on both sides -- and that the C.I.A. is not sharing the assessments of their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a timely way, often giving them to Pakistani officials days after an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A powerful Taliban faction in a northwestern tribal region has said it is withdrawing from a peace deal with the government to protest continuing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, confronting the Pakistani military with a possible two-front campaign against militants, according to Pakistani news reports on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban faction, led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, operates in the mountainous North Waziristan area along the border with Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It struck a peace deal with the authorities in February 2008, but Mr. Gul Bahadur said the truce was no longer operative. The Taliban announcement on Monday came as American reinforcements were  moving into Afghanistan. Taliban fighters there have traditionally relied on havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One day before the announcement, as many as 150 militants attacked a Pakistani military convoy about 22 miles west of Miramshah, the capital of North Waziristan. At least 30 soldiers -- the Taliban claimed 60 -- were believed to have been killed in the ambush, which pointed to the army's vulnerability in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, The Associated Press reported that four people were killed in southwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday when a car bomber attacked trucks taking supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The end of the peace deal came as the Pakistani military prepared for an offensive against another Taliban group, led by Baitullah Mehsud, in neighboring South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud is widely depicted as the main leader of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has  claimed  responsibility for a string of deadly bombings. The Pakistani authorities had been hoping to deny Mr. Mehsud support from North Waziristan, but Mr. Gul Bahadur's decision has significantly expanded the theater of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmadullah Ahmadi, a spokesman  for Mr. Gul Bahadur, was quoted by Pakistani news organizations as saying that guerrilla </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be made against the Pakistani military unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were stopped and government troops were pulled out of North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces everywhere in Waziristan unless the government fulfills these two demands,'' Mr. Ahmadi told Dawn, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most prestigious English-language daily newspaper. Mr. Ahmadi accused the government of allowing the United States to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gul Bahadur says that more than 50 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the peace deal have killed hundreds of people, including women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the military convoy on Sunday, military vehicles lay wrecked and destroyed around the bodies of soldiers. Under the 2008 peace agreement, militants agreed not to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces or establish a parallel administration. But the peace was tenuous and strained by mutual distrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The truce came after the government offered major concessions,  like dismantling military checkpoints, releasing detained militants and compensating them and other tribesmen for their losses suffered during the military operation, Pakistani news organizations reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In return, elders of the Utman Zai tribe, which inhabits the area, had assured the government that there would be no cross-border movement and that foreigners would not be allowed to take refuge. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-nine civilians, including eight children, were killed in what appeared to be six missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Israeli </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Gaza in December and January, according to a report released Tuesday by Human Rights Watch. The group questioned whether Israeli forces had taken ''all feasible precautions'' to avoid civilian casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel's military has never acknowledged using the remotely piloted planes to fire missiles. In a statement released Tuesday, it said that it had used an assortment of weapons and technologies to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, a spokeswoman for the Israeli military, said Israeli forces had also gone to extraordinary lengths to warn civilians during the Gaza offensive, and she questioned the credibility of some of the Palestinian witnesses cited by the advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report, based on interviews with witnesses to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an examination of the missile debris, represented the latest in a series of accusations about Israel's conduct of the Gaza war. And it raised broader concerns about how carefully </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were being used, much like the complaints that the Central Intelligence Agency has encountered in its use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda  in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report was partly written by Marc Garlasco, the senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, who was a weapons-targeting official at the Pentagon from 1997 to 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Garlasco has praised the American military's use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying that their ability to hover over a target for many hours had improved the accuracy of many missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and limited civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group's findings in Gaza suggest that ''the weapon itself isn't the problem,'' he said in an interview. ''It's the way it's used that is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''The operators have the ability to distinguish between combatants and civilians and can even divert the missiles after launch. So it's hard to understand how the Israelis did such a poor job of targeting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel has said that it uses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to gather intelligence and to help provide target information for helicopters and other aircraft. But Mr. Garlasco said the missile impact marks and the highly fragmented debris in the six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> matched the smaller missiles typically used by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rather than the larger antitank missiles that Israeli helicopters were seen carrying in Gaza. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report said one missile had hit a group of university students waiting for a bus in the center of Gaza City, while another struck a truck hauling oxygen tanks and a third smashed into a school sheltering people who had lost or left their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In three other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the report said, the victims were six children, ages 10 to 15, who had been playing on residential rooftops. Muhammad al-Habbash, the father of one of the girls who was killed, told Human Rights Watch that some of the children had been feeding chickens that the family kept on the roof when the missile struck. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At another house, Nahla Allaw said her son's legs had been crushed and blood poured from small holes in his chest as he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While fighters from Hamas, the militant Palestinian faction that controls Gaza, often placed artillery spotters on rooftops, the group found no evidence of militants in the area at the time of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the report said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When asked about the rooftop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Leibovich, the Israeli military spokeswoman, said, ''This is the first time I am hearing of these specific incidents.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel has said that over all, 1,166 people were killed in the Gaza offensive. Of those, 295 were noncombatants, 709 were Hamas fighters and 162 were men whose affiliations could not be identified, Israeli officials have said. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza has said 1,417 people were killed, including 926 civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Israeli military has conducted internal investigations into its conduct during the 22-day war, which determined it had operated in accordance with international law. The United Nations Human Rights Council is conducting an investigation into allegations of war crimes by Israel and Hamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the truck, the Israel Defense Forces released video of the event, contending that they had killed men who were loading rockets. The military later acknowledged that the cylinders on the truck were oxygen tanks, though it also said they could have been used in rocket production. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colonel Leibovich said few military forces had ever taken as many precautions to minimize civilian casualties as Israel did in Gaza, dropping 500,000 leaflets warning people that its forces were arriving and even making telephone calls to neighbors of those thought to be  Hamas fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were also numerous cases where pilots had to reverse the missiles because they saw civilians enter the area,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P. W. Singer, the author of a recent book on military robots called ''Wired for War,'' said Israel might  also be finding that using the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''certainly raises the bar of expectations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because you can target more precisely, people hold you to a higher standard,'' he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani Army helicopter crashed in a northwestern tribal area that is a Taliban stronghold on Friday, killing at least 26 Pakistani soldiers and paramilitary fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military said the helicopter had technical problems, and several Pakistani security officials said it was carrying too many people, but Dawn TV reported that local officials said insurgents had shot it down. One security official also said bad weather might have contributed to the crash.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that although the official number of those killed was 26, 41 people had died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has lost many troops in offensives against the Taliban, and the crash -- which the authorities said killed three officers -- is grim news for the army, whether militants were involved or not. It comes as the military is locked in renewed struggle with the Taliban and is preparing for what is sure to be a difficult, full-scale offensive in South Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier in the day, several residents in South Waziristan reported what they said was an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a militant training camp by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed at least 13 people. A Pakistani intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mazarai Narai but said eight people had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The residents, who were reached by phone and requested anonymity because of security concerns, said most of the dead appeared to be militants. The United States routinely withholds comment on suspected </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there have been at least 40 since August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of South Waziristan, as well as the area of the helicopter crash, in Chapri Ferozkhel, near the border of the Orakzai and Khyber tribal regions, are controlled by forces loyal to Baitullah Mehsud, a Taliban leader accused of masterminding some of the deadliest suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A government official said the aircraft that was lost Friday was a transport helicopter. Helicopter gunships have been shelling the area over the past several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The helicopter had been traveling from the Kurram tribal area to Peshawar, according to one security official who was not authorized to speak to the media. He said local witnesses said that the weather was bad and that the helicopter was flying low in an area of high mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So it could either be due to bad weather or because of excess weight, but nothing can be ruled out,'' the security official said. According to the Web site of the Federation of American Scientists, the helicopter, an MI-17, can carry 24 troops. If 41 people were aboard, the aircraft would have been harder to maneuver, making it difficult to deal with bad weather and mountainous terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The security official said that flying low could have made the helicopter vulnerable to being hit by militant fire. ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and transport helicopters usually fly high to avoid fire from the ground,'' he said.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEWS Iraq celebrated the withdrawal of American troops from its cities on Tuesday with parades, fireworks and a national holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWSPresident Obama called it ''an important milestone,'' and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki proclaimed himself the proud leader of a country independent at last. But nearly 130,000 American troops remain in the country, and Mr. Obama warned of ''difficult days ahead'' as Iraqi troops and security forces find themselves on their own, prepared or not. As if to underscore Mr. Obama's concerns, the day was marred by a suicide bombing in Kirkuk that killed 33 people. More bombings followed through the week. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWSSaddam Hussein told F.B.I. interrogators before his execution that he let the world believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction so his country would not appear weak before Iran, its powerful neighbor and foe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS The interviews point up Mr. Hussein's striking miscalculation of the risks he faced and the United States' mistaken estimate of the threat Iraq really posed. In the interviews, Mr. Hussein also described Osama bin Laden as a ''zealot'' and denied that Iraq had any substantive ties to Al Qaeda. Both that claim, and the assertion that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, were later confirmed by American intelligence agencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS Almost 4,000 United States Marines pushed into the volatile Helmand River Valley in southwestern Afghanistan, where poppy harvests and opium smuggling provide major financing for the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS Helmand is one of the country's deadliest provinces, where Taliban fighters have waged guerrilla war against British forces based there. The Marine operation is the first major push into the region by a bolstered American force, whose counterinsurgency strategy calls for troops to live and patrol near towns and cities. ''Where we go we will stay, and where we stay, we will hold,'' said the commander, Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS The United States resumed secret military intelligence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hunt down a top Taliban commander, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS The increased intelligence cooperation comes as the White House speeds delivery of helicopters, body armor and other equipment that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sought to combat the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud. Providing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with sophisticated intelligence gets around, at least for the moment, tensions surrounding the administration's refusal to provide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which the United States has used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban targets in recent weeks and months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NEWS Iranian authorities indicated that they would put on trial some of the nine local British Embassy staff members arrested after the unrest that followed Iran's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE NEWS Tehran has sought to cast Britain as an instigator of the protests and has accused the embassy workers of fomenting unrest. On Friday, the cleric who heads Iran's influential Guardian Council said the workers would be tried after they ''made confessions.'' Britain has been pressing European Union members to withdraw their ambassadors in protest. But some of those countries say that would leave them with few diplomatic options if the crisis deteriorates further.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the same village, Zangara, missed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban by hours, a Pakistani security official said soon after that missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> routinely withhold comment on suspected </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military, which is locked in renewed battle with the Taliban, has been preparing a full-scale offensive in South Waziristan, where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, is based. In the prelude to the offensive, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have appeared to try to home in on Mr. Mehsud and forces loyal to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before that, the United States was sending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mainly to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign members of Al Qaeda or Taliban commanders who focused their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on neighboring Afghanistan. Mr. Mehsud, however, has taken on the Pakistani government and is accused of masterminding a string of deadly suicide bombings in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One intelligence official who spoke about Tuesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the condition of anonymity said three Uzbek militants had been killed along with 13 local Taliban militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud's subtribe, the Shabi Khel, is based in the area, and Makeen, a town where intelligence officials have thought Mr. Mehsud is based, is nearby. ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was very precise and accurate,'' a resident reached by telephone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several rooms of the militants' compound were destroyed in the midday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the intelligence official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mountainous region where Mr. Mehsud's fighters are entrenched is considered one of the most difficult terrains for conventional warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Publicly, Pakistani officials have been critical of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calling them a breach of the country's sovereignty. But privately, Pakistani officials acknowledge the utility of such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially when militants are struck with few civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani government has repeatedly asked the United States to give it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its own. In an interview that The Daily Telegraph in Britain published on Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, reiterated the demand. ''My position is that I have always asked for possession of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; I want the Pakistani flag on it,'' the paper quoted Mr. Zardari as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Opposition politicians, on the other hand, vociferously oppose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and see them as a major cause of public dissatisfaction with the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remotely piloted United States aircraft killed at least 43 militants loyal to the leader of the Pakistani Taliban in two different </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, according to regional news reports that could not be independently confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one on a forest training camp and the other on a vehicle convoy, were the latest in a growing number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at the network of the Taliban leader, Beitullah Mehsud. His group is suspected of arranging most of the suicide bombs in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years as well as the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, officials and residents said a suspected United States missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 16 militants in the same South Waziristan tribal region as Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The frequency and apparent accuracy of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was an indication, the officials said, of an enhanced level of cooperation between the Americans and Pakistanis, who have been uneasy allies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Against this backdrop of rising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> another major leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands militants in the contested northern Swat Valley, was wounded Wednesday in an airstrike, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army spokesman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According ''to credible information, in one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fazlullah has been injured,'' Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, a military spokesman, said at a news conference in the capital, Islamabad, in which he tried to reassure the  public that the militant leadership in the Swat Valley had been so badly damaged that it could no longer marshal resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However,  it was  unclear how seriously Mr. Fazlullah was hurt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2007, Mr. Fazlullah, a fiery cleric also known as FM Mullah  and Radio Mullah for using radio broadcasts to spread his extreme beliefs, organized thousands of well-armed militants. They gained control of the picturesque valley, 100 miles north of Islamabad, in what was the start of a new phase of struggle with the Taliban. For the first time, heavy fighting moved in from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal fringe and into more settled areas of the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fazlullah and his followers terrorized the local population through beheadings, public executions, burning of girls' schools and destruction of  infrastructure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States military routinely refrains from commenting on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which have only recently been aimed at Mr. Mehsud and his supporters. Earlier, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed aimed mainly at foreign militants with links to Al Qaeda or to Taliban commanders who were sending insurgents to fight the American-led coalition inside Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has objected to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> viewing them as a violation of national sovereignty. But privately, officials acknowledge that they are useful if they avoid civilians and hit  militants. The government has repeatedly asked the United States to supply </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the news conference, Pakistani government and military officials declined to comment on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Qamar Zaman Kaira, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> information minister, expressed criticism. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are counterproductive,'' Mr. Kaira said. ''They don't produce the desired results.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said that despite a recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a military convoy in North Waziristan that resulted in the killing of dozens of soldiers, the military operation would remain limited to the South Waziristan region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have no plans of extending the operation to North Waziristan,'' General Abbas said. ''This operation is very focused. It is against a network which is responsible for conducting most of the terrorist acts and suicide bombings in our cities and towns.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Abbas said the  operation in South Waziristan would be against Mr. Mehsud's network. ''It is neither against any tribe nor the region,'' he said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two Tumultuous Years in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By Nicholas Schmidle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Illustrated. 254 pp. Henry Holt &amp; Company. $25</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taking office in January, Barack Obama promised a radically different vision of foreign policy from that of his predecessor. But on perhaps the most critical issue, the new king looks a lot like the old one. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President Obama has retained the Bush administration's targeted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against suspected militants and may quietly be expanding the Central Intelligence Agency's covert battle against jihadis along the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Afghanistan border. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Nicholas Schmidle, a contributor to publications including The New York Times Magazine, The New Republic and Slate, reveals in a richly reported book based on his two years traveling across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, United States policy does not change because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sadly, does not change. Birthed in 1947 by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the lawyer son of a rich merchant, the country remains in the grip of venal, feudal, wealthy politician-landlords like the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and the current president, Asif Ali Zardari, for whom democracy means one vote one time, after which the victors go on to dominate indefinitely. Worse, greed and graft have led Islamabad's ruling class to ignore large portions of the population, who remain illiterate, and their incompetent governance has opened the door to Islamists' offering average Pakistanis promises that the first Mayor Daley would have recognized -- safe and orderly streets -- not through machine politics but through the brutal application of Shariah law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Founded as a homeland for Muslims, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never coalesced into a nation: from Sindh to Peshawar, Schmidle uncovers a politics based on identity, rather than ideological platforms, and thus incapable of compromise. Schmidle finds that there is not one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but that ''each province'' represents ''its own, distinct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' In his time in the country, he sees the collapse of identity politics only once, when students organize to oust the dictator Pervez Musharraf. ''For the first time in more than 20 years, students gathered for a cause . . . and not just an identity or an ideology,'' Schmidle writes. But when Musharraf goes, and terrorists kill the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, the country descends into identity-first bloodletting once again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At times, Schmidle's work, a collection of chapter-length anecdotes, coheres little better than Pakistani politics. Parts read like stand-alone articles, and Schmidle diverges into topics, like politics in Bangladesh, that stray from the narrative thrust about the long-term survival of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But what anecdotes. Brave enough to seek out some of the country's toughest jihadis despite the grave dangers facing American reporters in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Schmidle has amassed a treasure chest of stories. And unlike some traveling correspondents who turn the lens inward, he never allows himself -- his reactions to being dropped in the Talibanized northwest or in the middle of an urban protest march -- to overshadow his Pakistani characters. Schmidle ventures into Baluchistan, a province ignored by most Western reporters, though it is the site of a bloody separatist struggle every bit as dangerous to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unity and survival as the fight against the Taliban in the North-West Frontier. In his sharpest, most elegant portrait, he describes Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who fought to the death in the bloody siege of Islamabad's Red Mosque two years ago, not as a mere radical but as a complex, media-savvy cleric-politician capable of massaging his public image to appear both intimidating enough to draw in young jihadis and modern enough to attract Western interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another timely account, Schmidle travels into the remote Swat region, crossing at one point on a zip-line tram, to meet Maulana Fazlullah, a leader of the Pakistani Taliban. Again, Schmidle presents more than the brutal jihadi of most media coverage. He encounters Fazlullah in a ''bulky black turban and a goofy smile,'' assuring Schmidle that ''you are our guests.'' And yet the reader cannot forget that Fazlullah is believed to have masterminded the string of murderous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Taliban in Lahore, Islamabad and other cities in recent weeks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike a more nuanced work of reporting (say, George Packer's 2005 book on Iraq, ''The Assassins' Gate''), Schmidle's project leaves us with few conclusions, few ideas of how to create function out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chaos. In his last few pages, after his final trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where he had been pursued relentlessly by the police and intelligence agents, he simply cops out. Recalling a question put to him by his grandfather -- ''What's wrong with that place?'' -- Schmidle writes, ''I realized that I was no closer to offering a comprehensive answer now than I had been'' at the start of the journey.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then again, in his confusion about how to understand </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Schmidle finds himself in good company: from Truman to Obama, and from Jinnah to Zardari, no American or Pakistani president has figured out a solution in the country, either. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency has developed plans to dispatch small teams overseas to kill senior Qaeda terrorists, according to current and former government officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plans remained vague and were never carried out, the officials said, and Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, canceled the program last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials at the spy agency over the years ran into myriad logistical, legal and diplomatic obstacles. How could the role of the United States be masked? Should allies be informed and might they block the access of the C.I.A. teams to their targets? What if American officers or their foreign surrogates were caught in the midst of an operation? Would such activities violate international law or American restrictions on assassinations overseas?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet year after year, according to officials briefed on the program, the plans were never completely shelved because the Bush administration sought an alternative to killing terror suspects with missiles fired from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft or seizing them overseas and imprisoning them in secret C.I.A. jails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Panetta scuttled the program, which would have relied on paramilitary teams, shortly after the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism center recently informed him of its existence. The next day, June 24, he told the two Congressional Intelligence Committees that the plan had been hidden from lawmakers, initially at the instruction of former Vice President Dick Cheney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The program was designed in the frantic weeks after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when President George W. Bush signed a secret order authorizing the C.I.A. to capture or kill operatives of Al Qaeda around the world. To be able to kill Osama bin Laden or his top deputies wherever they might be -- even in cities or countries far from a war zone -- struck top agency officials as an urgent goal, according to people involved in the discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in practice, creating and training the teams proved difficult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It sounds great in the movies, but when you try to do it, it's not that easy,'' a former intelligence official said. ''Where do you base them? What do they look like? Are they going to be sitting around at headquarters on 24-hour alert waiting to be called?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment for this article. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There has been intense speculation about the nature of the program since members of the House Intelligence Committee disclosed last week that Mr. Panetta had put an end to it. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the secret program was intended to capture or kill senior Qaeda leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Current and former officials said that the program was designed as a more ''surgical'' solution to eliminating terrorists than missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with armed Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which cannot be used in cities and have occasionally resulted in dozens of civilian casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been successful, and I was pleased to see the Obama administration continue them,'' said Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ''This was another effort that was trying to accomplish the same objective.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bond would not discuss specific details about the terminated C.I.A. program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not clear why Mr. Panetta decided to cancel the program. The C.I.A. never proposed a specific operation to the White House for approval, said the officials, who would only speak anonymously because the program had been classified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because the program never carried out any missions and because Congress had already signed off on the agency's broad authorities after Sept. 11, the officials and some Republican legislators said the C.I.A. was not required to brief lawmakers on specifics of the program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Congressional Democrats were furious that the program had not been shared with the committees. The Senate and House oversight committees were created by law in the 1970s as a direct response to disclosures of C.I.A. abuses, notably including assassination plots against Patrice Lumumba of Congo, Fidel Castro in Cuba and other foreign politicians. President Gerald R. Ford in 1976 issued an executive order banning assassinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That ban does not apply to the killing of enemies in a war, government officials say. The Bush administration took the position that killing members of Al Qaeda, a terrorist group that has attacked the United States and stated that its goal is to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> again, is no different than shooting enemy soldiers on the battlefield. The Obama administration, which has continued to fire missiles from Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on suspected Qaeda members in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken the same view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kenneth Anderson, a law professor at American University who has studied targeted killings, said the United States first made the argument in 1989 that killing terrorists would not violate the assassination ban and would be a legal act of self-defense under international law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such killings would be premised on the condition that the authorities in the country where the terrorist was located were unable or unwilling to stop the terrorist, Mr. Anderson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In legal terms, he said, there is no real difference between killing a terrorist with a missile or with a handgun. ''In political terms,'' he continued, ''there's a real difference.  The missile feels more like regular warfare, even if it's carried out by the C.I.A.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But any targeted killings make many specialists in international law uneasy.  Hina Shamsi, an adviser to the Project on Extrajudicial Executions at New York University, said that any calculation about inserting an assassination  team would have to consider the following: the violation of the sovereignty of the country where the killing occurred; the different legal status of the C.I.A. compared with the uniformed military; and whether the killing would be covered by the law of war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The issue is a complex one under international law,'' Ms. Shamsi said,  ''and it encompasses all of the contentious issues of the years since 2001.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his 2006 book ''State of War,''  James Risen wrote that the C.I.A. set up paramilitary teams shortly after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hunt down top Qaeda operatives. Mr. Risen, a reporter for The New York Times, wrote that the operation was soon disbanded before the C.I.A. carried out any operations. But the spy agency continued to develop plans to focus on Qaeda operatives, and top C.I.A. officials were briefed periodically about the progress of these efforts, the officials familiar with the program said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In spring  2008, Michael V. Hayden, then the agency's director, and his top aides were told about one aspect of these plans that involved gathering sensitive information in a foreign country, a former senior intelligence official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hayden ordered that the operation be scaled back and that Congress be notified if the plans became more fully developed, the official said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The movies make it look so easy: the sniper's crosshairs on a terrorist's forehead; the plastic explosive taped beneath a foreign spy's car; the lethal potion slipped into a dictator's morning coffee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So perhaps the biggest surprise about the Central Intelligence Agency's  furor du jour -- the secret program, hidden from Congress, to kill the leaders of Al Qaeda -- is not that there was such a program, which many Americans assumed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor is it that former Vice President Dick Cheney instructed the C.I.A. to keep the program from Congress. Mr. Cheney has never been accused of reckless openness about intelligence programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The real surprise is that in eight years of off-again, on-again brainstorming, planning and training, the program did not kill a single terrorist. It did not even mount an attempt, C.I.A. officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Killing a specific terrorist in a faraway country, using the up-close-and-personal methods that the secret program was created to explore, turns out to be considerably more complicated than the cinematic fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dropping missiles from unmanned aircraft has proven logistically and politically so much simpler that the alternatives have never been tried, intelligence officers say. Al Qaeda has obliged by hiding out not in cities but in the rugged mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hence President Obama has not only continued the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> begun under President George W. Bush, but even stepped them up. Despite the collateral killings of terrorist suspects' families and neighbors, and the broader political backlash such missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> produce, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> keep American intelligence officers thousands of miles from the deaths, which clearly has made this approach attractive to both administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Few operations are riskier than a targeted killing, but the idea of eliminating a very bad guy has an alluring simplicity. Had the Clinton administration found a way to kill Osama bin Laden, might that have scuttled  the 9/11 plot? Had a Bush administration hit team taken out Saddam Hussein, might Mr. Bush not have led the country into a messy, costly war? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the reasons the C.I.A. might have hesitated before dispatching a team of killers are easily imagined by anyone who has followed the gyrations of the agency's history. Time and again in recent decades, the C.I.A. has been pressured by a president to take risky actions, only to face investigations and condemnation when the actions are exposed. This pattern reflects a deep American ambivalence about the secret power of the intelligence agencies, which often seems at odds with the democratic ideals of openness and fairness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A.'s biggest worries as it contemplated ordering an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a terrorist overseas may not have been about the law, said William C. Banks, a law professor at Syracuse who has studied targeted killings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least by American government calculations, the killing of a Qaeda member is an act of war, not assassination. The ban on assassination, in effect since President Gerald Ford's executive order of 1976, would apply only to ''politically inspired killings of people who are not combatants,'' Mr. Banks said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be a lawful target, a terrorist must be ''engaged in armed combat with the United States,'' Mr. Banks said. ''Bin Laden is the poster child, and you work your way down the Al Qaeda ladder from there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Killing such a target would arguably be permissible, Mr. Banks said, if he were in hostile territory where capture was infeasible. But if the target were in Paris, for instance, the United States would be obligated under the law of war to work with French authorities to seize the suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The logistical difficulty and political risk of picking off a terrorist away from a war zone are daunting. Consider the fallout from some of the C.I.A.'s more notorious operations to grab terrorist suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the C.I.A. seized a radical Muslim cleric in Milan in 2003 and flew him to Egypt, Italian authorities tracked the whole operation through cellphone calls and hotel receipts, leading to a criminal trial for 26 Americans in absentia that is still going on. Another rendition team picked up a Lebanese-born German citizen in Macedonia and took him to Afghanistan  --  setting off an international fiasco for the United States when it turned out the C.I.A. had grabbed the wrong Khalid el-Masri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a record of tradecraft would not exactly encourage C.I.A. bosses to give the ''go'' order to a killing team. And in any case, anyone familiar with the agency's history would already have ample reason for caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assassination is a word that still haunts the C.I.A. The most lurid of the volumes produced by the Senate committee headed by Frank Church of Idaho in the mid-1970s detailed the C.I.A.'s plots to kill foreign political figures, including Cuba's Fidel Castro and the Congo's Patrice Lumumba. Such intrigues were overseen by the agency's so-called Health Alteration Committee, which once O.K.'d the dispatch of a monogrammed, poisoned handkerchief to a left-leaning Iraqi colonel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But those schemes were as ineffective as they were scandalous. Mr. Castro, now 82, has outlived most of those who plotted to kill him. Mr. Lumumba was killed by a rival Congolese group after the would-be C.I.A. assassin balked. The Iraqi colonel ''suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad,'' as a sardonic C.I.A. memo put it, before the handkerchief could do its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People forget this now, but when the Church report came out there was a lot of mockery of the C.I.A. as the gang that couldn't shoot straight,'' said Loch K. Johnson, a former Church committee staff member and author of many books on intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other nations' schemes, too, have a checkered record. The Israelis have long used targeted killings against their Palestinian enemies, but Israeli agents killed a Moroccan waiter in Norway in 1973 after mistaking him for a Black September terrorist. Two Russians who killed a former Chechen leader in Qatar in 2004 with a bomb under his car were caught, tried and convicted of the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Targeted killings are ''very difficult to pull off, and it's politically toxic if you're caught,'' said Geneve Mantri, who tracks counterterrorism programs at Amnesty International. ''This Jason Bourne stuff is great for the movies, but the history is that these cases often end up as a mess.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is objecting to expanded American combat operations in neighboring Afghanistan, creating new fissures in the alliance with Washington at a critical juncture when thousands of new American forces are arriving in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials have told the Obama administration that the Marines fighting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan will force militants across the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with the potential to further inflame the troubled province of Baluchistan, according to Pakistani intelligence officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not have enough troops to deploy to Baluchistan to take on the Taliban without denuding its border with its archenemy, India, the officials said. Dialogue with the Taliban, not more fighting, is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national interest, they said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani account made clear that even as the United States recommits troops and other resources to take on a growing Taliban threat, Pakistani officials still consider India their top priority and the Taliban militants a problem that can be negotiated. In the long term, the Taliban in Afghanistan may even remain potential allies for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as they were in the past, once the United States leaves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani officials gave views starkly different from those of American officials regarding the threat presented by top Taliban commanders, some of whom the Americans say have long taken refuge on the Pakistani side of the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recent Pakistani military operations against Taliban in the Swat Valley and parts of the tribal areas have done little to close the gap in perceptions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as Obama administration officials praise the operations, they express frustration that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is failing to act against the full array of Islamic militants using the country as a base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, they say, Pakistani authorities have chosen to fight Pakistani Taliban who threaten their government, while ignoring Taliban and other militants fighting Americans in Afghanistan or terrorizing India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such tensions have mounted despite a steady rotation of American officials through the region. They were on display last weekend when, during a visit to India, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said those who had planned the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were now sheltering in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued an immediate rebuttal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critical assessment was provided as the Obama administration's special envoy for the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The country's perspective was given in a nearly two-hour briefing on Friday for The New York Times by senior analysts and officials of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main spy service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence. They spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the agency's policy. The main themes of the briefing were echoed in conversations with several military officers over the past few days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the first briefing slides read, in part: ''The surge in Afghanistan will further reinforce the perception of a foreign occupation of Afghanistan. It will result in more civilian casualties; further alienate local population. Thus more local resistance to foreign troops.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A major concern is that the American offensive may push Taliban militants over the border into Baluchistan, a province that borders Waziristan in the tribal areas. The Pakistani Army is already fighting a longstanding insurgency of Baluch separatists in the province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Taliban spillover would require </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to put more troops there, a Pakistani intelligence official said, troops the country does not have now. Diverting troops from the border with India is out of the question, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the American and NATO commands in Afghanistan, Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, said in an e-mail message on Monday that there was no significant movement of insurgents out of Afghanistan, and no indication of foreign fighters moving into Afghanistan through Baluchistan or Iran, another concern of the Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani and American officials also cited some positive signs for the alliance. Increased sharing of information has sharpened the accuracy of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militant hide-outs by Pakistani F-16 warplanes and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. And Pakistani and American intelligence operatives are fighting together in dangerous missions to hunt down fighters from the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the tribal areas and in the North-West Frontier Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the intelligence briefing clearly illuminated the differences between the two countries over how, in the American view, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was still picking proxies and choosing enemies among various Islamic militant groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States maintains that the Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, leads an inner circle of commanders who guide the war in southern Afghanistan from their base in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say this Taliban council, known as the Quetta shura, is sheltered by Pakistani authorities, who may yet want to employ the Taliban as future allies in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview last week, the new leader of American and NATO combat operations in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, paused when asked whether he was getting the cooperation he wanted from Pakistani forces in combating the Quetta shura. ''What I would love is for the government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have the ability to completely eliminate the safe havens that the Afghan Taliban enjoy,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani intelligence officials denied that Mullah Omar was even in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, insisting that he was in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States asked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years to round up 10 Taliban leaders in Quetta, the Pakistani officials said. Of those 10, 6 were killed by the Pakistanis, 2 were probably in Afghanistan, and the remaining 2 presented no threat to the Marines in Afghanistan, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They also said no threat was posed by Sirajuddin Haqqani, an Afghan Taliban leader who American military commanders say operates with Pakistani protection out of North Waziristan and equips and trains Taliban fighters for Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, Washington presented evidence to Pakistani leaders that Mr. Haqqani, working with Inter-Services Intelligence, was responsible for the bombing last summer of the Indian Embassy in Kabul that killed 54 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials insisted that Mr. Haqqani spent most of his time in Afghanistan, suggesting that the American complaints about him being provided sanctuary were invalid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, is also a source of deep disagreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  India and the United States have criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for allowing Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, to be freed from jail last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani officials said Mr. Saeed deserved to be freed because the government had failed to convince the courts that he should be kept in custody. There would be no effort to imprison Mr. Saeed again, in part because he was just an ideologue who did not have an anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda, the officials said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He grew up in the solid middle class of Suffolk County, the son of an engineer, the child of a couple that had emigrated from South America, a fan of football and video games, an altar boy and, eventually, a Boy Scout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Bryant Neal Vinas became very angry, according to his mother, when his parents' bitter divorce cleaved through his adolescence. He opted against college and instead joined the United States Army at 18. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Years later, he became a Muslim, joined a mosque, began visiting jihadist Web sites and, in 2008, found himself traveling to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and eventually Afghanistan. There, this young man from an American suburb tried to kill American soldiers in a Qaeda rocket </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a military base, according to federal court papers unsealed in Brooklyn on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some two months after the September assault, Mr. Vinas, going by names like Bashir al-Ameriki, or Bashir the American, was picked up by Pakistani authorities in Peshawar, according to American officials. Days later, he was back in the United States, providing counterterrorism officials with what they called ''valuable information'' gleaned from his visits to Al Qaeda's camps, leading to the arrests of senior Qaeda operatives and to Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Vinas, 26, pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to murder United States nationals, providing material support to Al Qaeda and receiving military training from the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also told Brooklyn federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents about discussions he had with operational planners from Al Qaeda about a plot to blow up a Long Island Rail Road train inside Pennsylvania Station, according to several law enforcement officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The information prompted a flurry of security activity over the Thanksgiving holiday as the authorities scrambled to take extra precautions, though it did not appear the planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had yet been put into motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The slight, dark-haired and pale-skinned Mr. Vinas, who the officials said began formally cooperating with federal authorities about two months later, also admitted assisting Al Qaeda by providing ''expert advice and assistance'' that was ''derived from specialized knowledge of the New York transit system and the Long Island Rail Road,'' according to the court papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two officials said that Mr. Vinas, who lived in Patchogue until he went to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, learned about the Long Island Rail Road as a regular rider and shared that information with Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who had planned to use it in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But neither official would provide specifics, and it appeared that Mr. Vinas's knowledge of details of the planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have been limited. The officials, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The papers unsealed on Wednesday include the terse, three-count criminal information that lists the charges against Mr. Vinas. Filed by prosecutors in the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Benton J. Campbell, it says that Mr. Vinas received ''military-type training'' from and on behalf of Al Qaeda between March and August 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He pleaded guilty to all three counts on Jan. 28 before Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of United States District Court in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lawyer for Mr. Vinas, who the court papers say was also known as Ibrahim and Ben Yameen al-Kanadee, would not discuss the charges against him or his cooperation with the authorities in the United States or Europe. ''We would just ask the public to withhold judgment until all the facts come out in this case,'' said the lawyer, Len H. Kamdang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One United States law enforcement official also said that Mr. Vinas, one of a tiny group of American citizens who have traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to train with Al Qaeda, had had contact with high-level members of the group there, but provided no names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the Qaeda leaders in Waziristan along the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border where Mr. Vinas trained, finding an American-born United States citizen with no criminal record and no previous ties to Islamist groups would seem priceless. He would be able to travel freely through the United States and Europe, with a knowledge of New York's transit systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, Mr. Vinas's cooperation is nearly as valuable a find for Western intelligence and counterterrorism investigators. He had knowledge of several camps he visited, the network that led him there and the high-level Qaeda officials with whom he met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Vinas worshiped at a mosque on Long Island, where he worked briefly as a truck driver and in a car wash, according to officials, one of whom said he had been largely ''self-radicalized.'' This official said that Mr. Vinas had met some people at the mosque, the Islamic Association of Long Island, but largely turned toward jihad on the Internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mosque's imam, Nayyar Imam, said Mr. Vinas, whom he called ''a very private person,'' had been praying there for a little more than a year, but stopped coming a year to 18 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I never saw any anger,'' he said, calling him ''very quiet and very smiley.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The young man's father, Juan Vinas, told The Los Angeles Times that his son left home suddenly in September 2007, saying he wanted to study Islam and Arabic. About a year later, F.B.I. agents interviewed the family after a truck bomb killed 55 people in Islamabad. Mr. Vinas has also provided information to European counterterrorism investigators, according to officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cases in Belgium and France center on two groups of French and Belgian citizens, several of whom trained in the camps, as well as a Moroccan-born woman, Malika El Aroud, who has been accused of using the Internet to recruit the young Muslim men to train with Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Vinas is expected to be a key witness in those cases because he spent time in the training camps with the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Vinas, who is in custody in New York, has also provided a 20-page witness statement that will be entered into evidence in the Belgian case, one law enforcement official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. El Aroud, a Belgian citizen, has become one of the most prominent Internet jihadists in Europe. Her husband killed the anti-Taliban resistance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud two days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the behest of Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a small number of United States citizens are known to have traveled to train or fight with Al Qaeda. John Walker Lindh of San Francisco was taken into custody by the United States military in Afghanistan, where he had been with the Taliban.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A son of Osama bin Laden was apparently killed in the past few months in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, American officials said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The son, Saad bin Laden, 27, was a member of Al Qaeda and had been part of a small group of Qaeda operatives that was involved in managing the terrorist organization from Iran. He had spent years under Iranian house arrest, but left under murky circumstances late last year or early this year and had been operating inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, American intelligence officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Preliminary indications point to his death, but it's not 100 percent certain,'' a United States counterterrorism official said Thursday. If the death is confirmed, Saad bin Laden will be the closest relative of Osama bin Laden to die as a result of American-led combat operations against Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was dealing with intelligence assessments, declined to identify his sources of information. But in similar situations, American intelligence officials have relied on communications intercepts, prisoner interrogations and statements on jihadist Web sites to confirm the deaths of high-ranking militants. Without a body on which to conduct DNA tests, it is hard for American officials to be absolutely certain of a militant's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When President Asif Ali Zardari of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited Washington in May, he was told that American intelligence officials were fairly certain that Saad bin Laden had been killed by a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earlier in the year, according to a Pakistani official, who said the American information was based on a communications intercept. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saad bin Laden was one of Osama bin Laden's older sons, and officials believed he was captured by the authorities in Iran while escaping Afghanistan after American troops invaded in 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the book ''The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century'' by Steve Coll (Penguin Press, 2008), Osama bin Laden has at least 23 children by several wives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement on Jan. 16 announcing financial sanctions against Saad bin Laden and three other people believed to be Qaeda operatives and thought to be in Iran, the Treasury Department said he ''has been involved in Al Qaeda activities,'' like helping bin Laden family members travel from Afghanistan to Iran. The statement said the younger Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi citizen born in 1982, ''was involved in managing the terrorist organization from Iran.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on Thursday, the American counterterrorism official sought to play down the younger bin Laden's role in his father's organization. ''This is a big name for obvious reasons, but not someone with a major league role in Al Qaeda,'' the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blog ''Long War Journal'' and NPR, the public radio network, reported on their Web sites on Wednesday that American officials believed that Saad bin Laden was probably dead. NPR cited an American counterterrorism official who said that he  had not specifically been the target of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but was ''in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-January, Mike McConnell, then director of national intelligence, told reporters that Saad bin Laden was probably in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But he gave no details about whether Mr. bin Laden had escaped from Iranian custody, whether his departure reflected a deal between Iran and Al Qaeda or whether he had simply been freed by Iranian officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saad bin Laden was one of a number of Qaeda operatives detained inside Iran in recent years. American officials have long puzzled over the exact circumstances of their captivity, but they think that Iran was holding the militants in part as a deterrent against a Qaeda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Iranian soil. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small remotely piloted planes are now used mainly to gather intelligence and fire missiles at insurgents. But over the next several decades, the Air Force envisions building larger ones that could do the work of bombers and cargo planes and even tiny ones that could spy inside a room.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a report released Thursday laying out a ''flight plan'' for developing pilotless systems, the Air Force also said it could eventually field swarms of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enemy targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it will have to be ready to defend against the same threat, which could become another inexpensive way for insurgents to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Col. Eric Mathewson, who directs the Air Force task force on pilotless aerial systems, said in an interview that the service sketched its vision to encourage contractors and university researchers to help create the technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military contractors have already been rushing to expand in what promises to remain a prime growth area even as Pentagon budgets tighten. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the last  decade, the use of remotely piloted planes has soared in Iraq, Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency have fielded Cessna-size </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, called Predators and Reapers, to send back video of insurgent activity and mount missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Army units have used hand-launched models, which look like toy planes, to peer over hills or buildings. Other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> monitor the seas and eavesdrop from high altitudes, much like the storied U-2 spy planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many of the systems have been rushed out in an ''almost reactive'' fashion, Colonel Mathewson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At the same time, we have put industry and academia at a disadvantage because we haven't told them where we're going,'' he said. ''So we wanted to describe the future, so they could help us find the solutions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colonel Mathewson said the goal was to create economical alternatives for most Air Force missions. In that sense, the plan  --  which was approved by Air Force Secretary Michael B. Donley and Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff  --  helps cement a major cultural change at the service, where many pilots initially recoiled at the idea of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colonel Mathewson said the service would like to create modular craft  --  basic airframes that could be easily configured for different missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report envisions a family ranging from ''nano''-size </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that could flit inside buildings like moths to gather intelligence, to large aircraft that could be used as strategic bombers or aerial refueling tankers. Midsize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could act like jet fighters, attacking other planes or ground targets and jamming enemy communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The changes will begin with enhancements of current systems, Colonel Mathewson said. The more exotic changes would come from 2020 through the 2040s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps the most controversial is the idea of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swarming on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advances in computing power could enable them to mount preprogrammed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on their own, though that would be a difficult legal and ethical barrier for the military to cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But before long, even a single insurgent could dispatch several small </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at once. Referring to the improvised explosive devices that insurgents have planted like mines in Iraq and Afghanistan, the report warned that the next inexpensive threat to American troops could be ''an airborne I.E.D.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Force is improving its ability to pinpoint and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militant targets with precision weapons, adding a new dimension to the country's fight against violent extremism, according to Pakistani military officials and independent analysts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military has moved away from the scorched-earth artillery and air tactics used last year against insurgents in the Bajaur tribal agency. In recent months, the air force has shifted from using Google Earth to sophisticated images from spy planes and other surveillance aircraft, and has increased its use of laser-guided bombs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The changes reflect an effort by the Pakistani military to conduct its operations in a way that will not further alienate the population by increasing civilian casualties and destroying property. But they are also dictated by necessity as the military takes its campaign into areas where it is reluctant to commit ground troops, particularly in the rugged terrain of Waziristan, where it had suffered heavy losses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military analysts say the airstrikes alone cannot ultimately substitute for ground forces or for better counterinsurgency training. But they say the airstrikes have become a valuable tool for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda in sometimes inaccessible terrain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since May, F-16 multirole fighter jets have flown more than 300 combat missions against militants in the Swat Valley and more than 100 missions in South Waziristan, attacking mountain hide-outs, training centers and ammunition depots, Pakistani military officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In conjunction with infantry fire, artillery barrages and helicopter gunship </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military officials say, the air combat missions reinvigorated the military campaign in Swat and have put increasing pressure on the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, in South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interviews with Pakistani fighter pilots and senior commanders offered a rare window into this other air war -- a much larger but less heralded campaign that runs parallel to the three dozen secret missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carried out this year by Central Intelligence Agencydrones in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The air force's new tools and tactics have several sources. The air force has without fanfare accepted some American assistance, like sophisticated surveillance equipment and high-grade images. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But sensitive to anti-American fervor in the country, Pakistani officials have refused most outside aid, developing a small corps of ground spotters largely on their own, and occasionally tapping the Internet for online assistance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials are urging the Obama administration to lease </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upgraded F-16s, until its own new fighters are delivered in the next year or two. This would allow Pakistani pilots to fly night missions, impossible with their current aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has argued that it needs the more advanced versions of the F-16 to more effectively  battle the Taliban insurgency. In the past, American officials raised concerns that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arms purchases and troop deployments  were geared mainly to bolstering its ability to fight its traditional enemy to the east, India. ''Of course, there is a real threat from India,'' Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> air force chief of staff, said in an interview at his headquarters here. ''But right now we have to tackle the threat from the militants.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly every day in the past few months, Pakistani warplanes have pummeled militant targets in the contested Swat Valley and South Waziristan. The campaigns are a big change from operations in Bajaur last fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The biggest handicap we had in Bajaur was that we didn't have good imagery,'' Air Chief Marshal Qamar said. ''We didn't have good target descriptions. We did not know the area. We were forced to use Google Earth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I didn't want to face a similar situation in Swat,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In advance of the Swat campaign, the air force equipped about 10 F-16s with high-resolution, infrared sensors, provided by the United States, to conduct detailed reconnaissance of the entire valley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has also resumed secret </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights performing military surveillance in the tribal areas, to provide Pakistani commanders with a wide array of videos and other information on militants, according to American officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In most cases, officials said, the Pakistani Army provides target information to the air force, which confirms the locations on newly detailed maps. Identifying high-value targets through the use of army spotters or, in  some cases, a new, small group of specially trained air force spotters, the air force was able to increase its use of laser-guided bombs to 80 percent of munitions used in Swat, from about 40 percent in Bajaur, Air Chief Marshal Qamar said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another change was the mass evacuation of civilians. About  two million people were displaced, sometimes with only a few hours' notice, as part of an effort to get civilians out of conflict areas to reduce their casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American officials voice skepticism about Pakistani claims of success. ''We don't have access to battle-damage assessment or the information on the actual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> execution, so we cannot make a qualitative comparison of what the intended effect was versus the actual effect,'' said an American adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, to avoid jeopardizing his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials of human rights organizations say the military has not been able to eliminate all civilian casualties from airstrikes and ground fire, but they agree that the numbers are down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Certainly, the level of civilian casualties in this phase of the conflict has been lower than in previous operations in the tribal areas,'' said Ali Dayan Hasan, senior South Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, based in Lahore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The air force still operates under limitations. Because the F-16s are equipped to fly only by day, the militants move and conduct operations at night. Indeed, not one of the 21 main militant leaders in Swat has been killed or captured, Pakistani officials acknowledge. In addition, the Pakistani jets cannot be refueled in midair, as American fighters can, limiting how long they can remain over a target area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In South Waziristan, as the army mulls a ground war, the air force continues to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militants' hide-outs and training camps as well as storage caves and tunnels with 500-pound and 2,000-pound bombs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're still developing our plans for South Waziristan,'' Air Chief Marshal Qamar said. ''We are preparing to ramp up. I think Baitullah Mehsud is getting the message, and the message is, if he keeps doing these things, we'll hit him.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A.missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas on Wednesday may have killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the country's fearsome Taliban militia, American and Pakistani officials said Thursday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials in Washington and Islamabad were scrambling to make sense of communications intercepts and other intelligence that seemed to indicate that Mr. Mehsud might have been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Thursday evening, American officials said they were growing increasingly confident that the Taliban leader was dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, they cautioned that it may be weeks before they are certain, and they may never gain access to the remote location in South Waziristan to perform DNA tests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is reason to believe that reports of his death may be true, but it can't be confirmed at this time,'' said an American official with access to classified intelligence reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud and his military network have been blamed for a wave of violence across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the  2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militant leader also seemed to take pleasure in taunting Pakistani officials and holding news conferences to demonstrate the inability of officials in Islamabad to rein in his network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud pledged to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, but American officials did not take the threat seriously. Still, his network is believed to have close ties to Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. made killing Mr. Mehsud one of its top priorities this year, partly at the urging of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian government. Pakistani officials, including President Asif Ali Zardari, had complained that the campaign of missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killing only  militants responsible for killing American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, the State Department has offered a reward of as much as $5 million for Mr. Mehsud. The C.I.A. also began trying to track his daily movements, and American intelligence officials believed on several occasions that they had almost killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is partly for this reason that officials remained cautious on Thursday about drawing definitive conclusions. Still, their confidence that Mr. Mehsud had been killed grew through the day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Taking Mehsud off the battlefield would be a major victory,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ''The world, and certainly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, would be a safer place without him.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early Wednesday morning hit a compound in the remote village of Zanghara, in South Waziristan. Village residents said that day that one of Mr. Mehsud's wives had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that several children had been wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although President Obama has distanced himself from many of the Bush administration's counterterrorism policies, he has embraced and even expanded the C.I.A.'s covert campaign in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials publicly condemn these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but they have privately given their blessing to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the country's tribal areas, in part because the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increasingly have focused on Mr. Mehsud's network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The news that Mr. Mehsud might have been killed was first reported on the Web site of ABC News. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Pir Zubair Shah, Sabrina Tavernise and Mark Mazzetti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- American and Pakistani officials said Friday they were increasingly convinced that an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two days earlier had killed Baitullah Mehsud, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enemy No.1 and the leader of its feared Taliban movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Mehsud was a pivotal figure who held together the loose and disparate network of militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, experts said his death would not end the violent Taliban insurgency, its ties to Al Qaeda or its push for Pakistani territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud, a militant in his 30s who made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> his top priority, was blamed for the assassination of the former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, and scores of suicide bombings, including at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which killed more than 50 people last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the result of months of closer cooperation by the Pakistani and American intelligence agencies. But his death would raise questions about how far the Pakistani authorities are now willing to go to crush the remnants of the Pakistani Taliban -- and how hard the Obama administration would continue to push them. The Taliban insurgency across the border in Afghanistan was not expected to be affected. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Mehsud network in fact  appeared to have weak links, as officials confirmed Friday that the intelligence about Mr. Mehsud's whereabouts had come partly from informants inside the Mehsud network who had been bought off by Pakistani spies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistanis who knew Mr. Mehsud said he had become less of an active operator since a serious kidney illness had become more acute. Several analysts also noted a tendency for military officials to focus excessively on one person -- like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, head of Al Qaeda in Iraq, whose death in 2006 did nothing to halt the violence in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The war will not finish,'' Gen. Javed Ashraf Qazi, former director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency, said in an interview. ''The rest of his group is still intact;  the man who prepared the suicide bombers is still alive. Army action is still necessary to take them out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday, from a C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, took place as Mr. Mehsud, a diabetic, was on a drip infusion for his kidney ailment, according to two Taliban fighters reached by telephone on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was being tended to by one of his wives, the fighters said, and according to Pakistani security officials who had viewed American video of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparently from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they were together on the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were both at the house of his father-in-law, Mulvi Ikramuddin, in the village of Zanghara, in South Waziristan. Mr. Ikramuddin's brother, a medical practitioner, was treating him, the Taliban fighters said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was clearly visible with his wife,'' said a senior security official, who had seen the video. ''His torso remained, while half of the body was blown up.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani counterterrorism official said that 12 people were confirmed to have been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including Mr. Mehsud, his wife, his father-in-law, his mother-in-law, one unidentified commander and seven bodyguards. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to American and Pakistani officials, was the result of steady intelligence-sharing between the countries' intelligence services. The cooperation improved around the time of a secret visit to Washington in April by Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the chief of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-Services Intelligence, to meet his C.I.A. counterpart, Leon E. Panetta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the meeting, the two sides agreed, among other things, to focus attention on striking the Mehsud network, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accuracy of American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Mehsud network improved soon afterward: the result of information gleaned by Pakistani intelligence operatives using informants inside the network, communications intercepts, and satellite imagery shared by the American and Pakistani intelligence services, according to the officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Pakistani officials had yet to confirm the death publicly on Friday -- Interior Minister Rehman Malik said they were waiting for proof, like a personal belonging -- behind the scenes they were planning their next step. ''This is 100 percent,'' a senior Pakistani intelligence official said. ''He is dead and buried.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials still would not say definitively on Friday that Mr. Mehsud was dead, in part because of the difficulty of getting forensic evidence to bolster their assessment. Yet they were clearly confident that the militant leader had been killed by Wednesday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While it's not 100 percent confirmed, there's real confidence that Mehsud is dead,'' one American counterterrorism official said. ''If he is gone, his death would offer a great opening to press the offensive against his organization and his Al Qaeda allies.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials said the Obama administration would be eager to exploit Mr. Mehsud's death in several ways. The United States is likely to press the Pakistani government to take more aggressive action against militant groups that use havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These groups include the Haqqani network, which is blamed for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the Indian Embassy in Kabul last year; and the Afghan Taliban leadership, including Mullah Muhammad Omar, around the Pakistani city of Quetta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Behind closed doors, the Americans will be saying, O.K., we've done you a big favor, now what can you do about Haqqani and the Quetta shura?'' said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington, referring to the Taliban council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military now must decide whether to take advantage of the likely disarray within the Pakistani Taliban's ranks to conduct a long-promised ground offensive into South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent interviews with senior Pakistani Army and intelligence officials, however, few commanders said they wanted to carry out what almost certainly would be a bloody ground war in the mountainous, unruly tribal areas, preferring to continue to rely on helicopter gunship </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> artillery barrages and F-16 airstrikes to pound the militants into submission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This will be a real test of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intentions,'' said Marvin Weinbaum, a former South Asia intelligence analyst for the State Department. ''Is this a threat to be contained or something to be eliminated?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taliban fighters said a meeting was under way to choose a successor from among Mr. Mehsud's top deputies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the possible successors were the No.2,  Hakimullah Mehsud, a young, brash and aggressive commander, once a driver, who until recently oversaw operations in the tribal regions of Khyber, Orakzai and Kurram, and who was credited with disrupting NATO supply lines to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Baitullah had groomed him well for the task,'' a senior Pakistani military official said. ''He could be a natural choice, but his shooting-from-the-hip attitude may actually down his chances.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another possibility, Waliur Rehman, who became Mr. Mehsud's right-hand man, is the most likely to succeed, several Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The third is a man identified by Pakistani officials as Azmatullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision will be influenced by another militant group in Waziristan, the Haqqanis, with close ties to the Afghan militant leader, Mullah Omar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No matter who is chosen, the Pakistani Taliban is not likely to change its mission of attacking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Mehsud was clearly responsible for a wide range of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, some Pakistani security officials believed that his network became so entwined with Al Qaeda and Punjabi groups that it was difficult to tell who was responsible for what. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud's group said it had carried out two recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Punjab -- one aimed at the intelligence headquarters in Lahore and another against the Sri Lankan cricket team -- but a lead investigator said evidence had pointed instead to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They used him as a brand to project their power across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' the investigator said. ''He didn't have the power, the skills or the money. It was Al Qaeda that did. They used him as a prop.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The investigator added, however, that Mr. Mehsud was involved in two other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Lahore, and cooperated with Al Qaeda by providing support and sanctuary in Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have a long way to go,'' Kamran Zaman Qaira, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> information minister, said in a television interview. ''Only killing one leader doesn't mean the other miscreants will go away.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official said his death would give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an opportunity to exploit the power vacuum, but the chance would be very fleeting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My only apprehension is that the new leader, to prove that the Taliban is alive and kicking and to boost the morale of the rank and file, might launch a couple of spectacular terrorist acts,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KABUL, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baitullah Mehsud is perhaps the most prominent example of a tribal Taliban fighter who at first fought in Afghanistan and cooperated with the Pakistani Army, but then turned against his own country, unleashing a vicious campaign of violence in the name of spreading the rule of Islam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most wanted terrorist in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the time of his apparent death on Wednesday in his mid-30s, he rocketed to notoriety in just three years as the leader of the Pakistani Taliban and became a key figure in Al Qaeda's regional operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His turn against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> state, intelligence analysts say, was seen as a direct result of his close alliance with Al Qaeda, in particular with Ayman al-Zawahri, the second in command, as well as the powerful Afghan Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also has a close working connection to Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud, whose death in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was yet to be officially confirmed, was accused of being behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister, in a suicide bombing in December 2007, among scores of other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These include last year's bombing of the Marriott Hotel in the capital, Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Ms. Bhutto that served as a wake-up call for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security services and political circles, which had for years supported those fighting in Afghanistan as Muslim heroes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Ms. Bhutto's death, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Ministry released a telephone intercept implicating Mr. Mehsud in her assassination, the liberal newspaper Daily Times wrote, ''Al Qaeda is now as much a Pakistani phenomenon as it is an Arab or foreign element.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud was once a minor figure in the small Shabi Khel branch of the Mehsud tribe in South Waziristan, an inhospitable mountainous territory that fiercely resisted efforts by the armies of the British empire to conquer it. The son of a prayer leader, he had a basic religious education where he grew up in Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan.  It was probably there that he was first recruited to fight in Afghanistan alongside the Taliban during their period in government in the late 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He served with the Taliban at the Kabul airport, according to a senior Afghan security official. After the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, he returned to his native Waziristan, accompanied by thousands of Afghan Taliban and hundreds of foreign Qaeda fighters who settled in North and South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the Pakistani Army began operations in Waziristan in 2004, Mr. Mehsud was promoted by the Taliban leadership to command the fighters from the Mehsud tribe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Pakistani officials still considered him someone they could deal with, and in February 2005 they signed a much-criticized peace deal under which the army pulled back its forces, giving Mr. Mehsud freedom to operate in South Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He quickly expanded his forces and power, and by December 2007 he had been named the leader of the Tehrik-e-Taliban, the umbrella movement that commands most of the Taliban groups throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and the adjoining Swat Valley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His growth had brought Mr. Mehsud back into confrontation with the Pakistani military. In 2007, he took about 250 Pakistani Army soldiers hostage when they tried to pass through his tribal territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hostage-taking came just days after the government laid siege to militants in the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July 2007, and was apparently in retaliation for the government's crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud began attacking Pakistani military and intelligence targets in the tribal areas and beyond, and was behind almost all of the scores of suicide bombings that have occurred in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cities since then, according to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the commander of the Pakistani Army.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghan security officials said that Mr. Mehsud had also sent suicide bombers to Afghanistan and to Iraq since 2006, as the number of suicide bombings soared in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He hosted many foreign fighters in his territory, including Uzbeks and others from Central Asia, and he ran training camps to indoctrinate suicide bombers, weapons he once called his own atom bombs. Working closely with him in training suicide bombers were two Pakistani militants, named Qari Zafar and Qari Hussain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud also ran private jails and held dozens of kidnapped hostages, trading them for money or for his own fighters caught by the Pakistani authorities. Among those who fell into his hands was the Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan, Tariq Azizuddin, who was held for three months and met Mr. Mehsud twice, according to Pakistani officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud already then complained that he had to be constantly on the move, to avoid the surveillance of C.I.A.-operated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which were striking targets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, the officials said. By this year he was moving every 30 minutes to avoid detection, according to a Taliban fighter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet he survived two large-scale operations against his fighters by the Pakistani military, one in January 2008 and another in June 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both times the Pakistani military seemed to pull back before finishing off Mr. Mehsud and his forces, prompting suspicions that he was still regarded as an asset by the military establishment, which has long supported militant groups  to fight proxy wars in Kashmir and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> escalated with complex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on government buildings and five-star hotels,  which were seen as  a threat to the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last March, the United States put a $5 million reward on his head. In June, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared him its ''enemy No. 1.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani officials said they had received information on Saturday that a ranking militant commander had been killed in a power struggle over who would take control of the Pakistani Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani government official and an intelligence official said Hakimullah Mehsud, a young and aggressive aide to the former Taliban leader, had been shot dead in a fight with Waliur Rehman, another commander who was seeking to become the leader, during a meeting in a remote mountain region near the Afghan border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reports of Hakimullah Mehsud's death could not be independently verified Saturday. If they are true, it would be the second major loss for the Pakistani Taliban in just a week, after reports that its supreme leader, Baitullah Mehsud, had been killed in an American airstrike on Wednesday. The killing would also solidify the belief among American and Pakistani intelligence officials that a power struggle has been brewing within the Pakistani Taliban, which is made up of many different tribes and factions that had been brought together under Baitullah Mehsud's leadership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier on Saturday, Hakimullah Mehsud talked to the BBC by telephone to claim that Baitullah was still alive. But in the evening, reports surfaced about the gunfight and Hakimullah's possible death. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Terrorism experts said a power struggle within the Pakistani Taliban could give Al Qaeda, which is also based in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a greater role in shaping the group's direction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials say that the two groups have become deeply enmeshed in recent years, with the Taliban helped by Al Qaeda's international reach and stream of financing from the Persian Gulf region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials in Washington could not confirm on Saturday the reports of Hakimullah Mehsud's death, which were also carried by the Pakistani news network Dawn TV. But an American counterterrorism official said the infighting could provide an opportunity for the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to exploit the rivalries that were likely to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of those opportunities, from the American point of view, would be the ability to focus its fleet of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft on attacking militant leaders who were involved in the Afghan war, or on Qaeda leaders planning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West. That has been a source of tension between the Americans and Pakistani officials, who had viewed the Mehsuds as the most urgent threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the United States considered Hakimullah Mehsud an important enough figure that at least one earlier airstrike had been aimed at killing him, American and Pakistani officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Pakistani official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the fighting could create an opening for the Haqqanis, another group that has close ties to Al Qaeda, to intervene in resolving the leadership issue. Sirajuddin Haqqani is the point man in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Details of the fighting were spotty on Saturday. The Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, confirmed reports of a shootout at a meeting in South Waziristan and said one of the commanders had been killed but did not say who it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The infighting was between Waliur Rehman and Hakimullah Mehsud,'' Mr. Malik told Reuters. ''We have information that one of them has been killed. Who was killed we will be able to say later after confirming.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reports received by government officials on Saturday indicated that Mr. Rehman and Mr. Mehsud --  a member of Baitullah's tribe but not a close relative --  argued over succession at a tribal meeting at Sara Rogha in South Waziristan. A shootout ensued, killing Mr. Mehsud and wounding Mr. Rehman, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior government official in Peshawar said Baitullah Mehsud's father-in-law, who had been at the meeting, was now in the custody of an opposing faction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond being a succession struggle, the infighting may also represent a deeper conflict over the goals and direction of the Pakistani Taliban. A resident of the area who spoke by telephone on Saturday said foreign militants favored Mr. Rehman while local Mehsuds wanted Hakimullah to be their new leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The alliance between Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban leaders goes back years in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas, where local Pakistani militants helped ferry Arab operatives back and forth across the border from Afghanistan. More recently it has surfaced in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> major cities, far from the war-torn western tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are interconnected,'' a Karachi counterterrorism official said, referring to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. ''They depend on each other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clear evidence of that alliance, counterterrorism officials say, was the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad. The bomber was an Afghan, trained by Taliban fighters in Mohmand Agency, part of the tribal area where the Mehsuds operate. But it was a Qaeda operative of Kenyan origin, Usama al-Kinni, who planned and financed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an added complication with serious implications for security in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the handlers and facilitators in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were from Punjab, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most populous and strategic province, which itself has been the target of a series of suicide bombings and commando-style </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since March. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police officials investigating those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that a poisonous mix of Al Qaeda and local Punjabi groups were responsible, and that the groups were operating out of a sanctuary provided to them by Baitullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Specifically, investigators said they had unearthed a series of small cells, whose leaders report to a Qaeda operative of Egyptian origin, Sheik Issa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the suspects arrested by Lahore investigators, a would-be suicide bomber in his 20s who claimed to have worked as a cook in Baitullah Mehsud's mountain base in South Waziristan, said the Arabs were clearly above the local Taliban fighters in hierarchy, and commanded gestures of respect from senior Taliban leaders wherever they went. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike Baitullah Mehsud, who lived openly in his area, Arabs live in hiding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, rarely moving around, and depending on local residents for cover. The foreign militants are respected because they are seen as men who gave up lives of luxury to fight in austerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most Qaeda operatives live in North Waziristan, home of the Wazir tribes, whose two leaders, Hafiz Gul Bahadur and Mulvi Nazeer, give them cover. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, is believed to have visited Mr. Mehsud's area in South Waziristan last year, said Mahmood Shah, a retired brigadier who used to be the ranking Pakistani commander in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Taliban fighter interviewed Saturday by telephone from Waziristan said that Qaeda Arabs remained separate, with their own facilities, meetings and leaders, but that they shared resources -- human and financial -- when the need arose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When we need something, they take care of us, and when they need something, we help them,'' explained the fighter, who said he had recently ferried 14 Arabs from one area of Waziristan to another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban fighter said the Arabs preferred to be assisted by militants from Punjab, who, unlike Pashtuns, the ethnic group that makes up the Taliban, can move unnoticed in central </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani security forces captured several militants of Saudi origin in May in Mohmand Agency, and the diary of one contained a warning: ''Don't speak in Arabic unless absolutely necessary. Speak Pashto whenever possible.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflicting claims continued to swirl Monday around what has become of the Taliban leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the movement's top commander, Baitullah Mehsud, was reported killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, the Pakistani government and intelligence officials have asserted that a possible successor to Mr. Mehsud had been killed in a power struggle. But in a phone call on Monday, a militant disputed assertions that any leaders, including Mr. Mehsud, had been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The back-and-forth statements underscored the difficulty of divining what is happening in the remote tribal region and in the ranks of the Pakistani Taliban leadership, which has strong links to Al Qaeda. A near complete news blackout has settled over the region, making verifying any claim almost impossible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the sweeping counterclaims of the militants were also an indicator of the stakes for the Pakistani Taliban leaders in terms of control over fighters, weapons and financing, as well as the evident stresses that the reports of Mr. Mehsud's death have placed on them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While American and Pakistani intelligence officials have not publicly confirmed Mr. Mehsud's death, they say the evidence for it is overwhelming. What is less clear is who is in charge now. On Monday, a man claiming to be Hakimullah Mehsud, the Taliban commander who Pakistani intelligence officials believed had been killed over the weekend in the power struggle, surfaced in a phone call to a news agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The caller, who contacted a reporter from Reuters, said that the government had falsely claimed he had been killed. The man also denied the death of the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have proven the government's claim of my death wrong and I challenge the government to prove the death of our amir,'' Reuters quoted the man as saying. ''Baitullah Mehsud is alive, safe and sound.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interior minister, Rehman Malik, challenged those assertions. In a telephone interview late Monday, he said the government had received intelligence over the weekend that a scuffle had broken out over who would take power and that Hakimullah Mehsud, one of the candidates, had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik said officials were convinced of Baitullah Mehsud's death, but had not been able to confirm it formally. Information about the fight and subsequent killing came from sources in the Taliban, he said, and though they believed the intelligence to be credible, it was less certain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Real proof of the counterclaims, he said, would be a video. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why don't they clearly come forward?'' he said. ''Calling from some number. The voice could be similar to others. There's something dubious going on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani intelligence official said that the information about Hakimullah Mehsud's death had come from intercepted phone conversations, and that a voice analysis was being done, as three Taliban commanders had similar-sounding voices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Reuters reporter, reached by phone, said he was sure the caller was Hakimullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the government is trying to enlist members of the Mehsud tribe against the Taliban. Mr. Malik met with tribal elders Monday evening and encouraged them to form a militia, elders said. But the suggestion did not appeal to them, mainly because such an action would put their families in danger and risk putting ancient tribal codes of revenge into action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The interior minister said they were about to finish,'' said Muhammed Zaman Mehsud, a tribal elder who attended the meeting. ''We don't know that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''We'll live in that area for the coming 100 decades. We simply cannot afford it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides, the tribe feels harassed by the government, which it says has arrested scores of its members, accusing them of being part of the Taliban. Some of them, the elder said, have been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They claim they are taking action against terrorists,'' the elder said. ''But to us, they are peaceful citizens.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the apparent killing of the Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President Obama seems to be having some success with his military policy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He is having less luck in Washington. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congress left town for its summer recess without passing a long-promised bill to triple American economic and development assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's plan to win the hearts and minds of the Pakistani people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came after months of improved cooperation between American and Pakistani intelligence officials. Mr. Mehsud and his network have orchestrated a bloody reign of terror across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and are blamed for the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, and last year's bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which left more than 50 people dead. Permanently removing him from the picture would be an obvious victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, force alone will not be enough to defeat the extremists. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama rightly criticized the Bush administration for overinvesting in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army while doing far too little to help build up its civil society -- the schools, courts, hospitals and roads that are essential to stability. Mr. Obama pledged to support legislation --  which was initially sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden and Senator Richard Lugar -- that would provide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with $7.5 billion in development assistance over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The aid -- and particularly its pledge of five years of uninterrupted help -- is intended to demonstrate that this time Washington is in for the long haul. Many Pakistanis still accuse the Americans of using and then abandoning them after the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. We fear that any more delay on the promised assistance would only reinforce that suspicion and bitterness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The House and Senate did manage to pass bills authorizing the aid, but with significant differences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both versions contained sound conditions and benchmarks to try to measure the effectiveness of the help. But the House added a variety of other provisions, including earmarks for military projects that favored American contractors and bullying language on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear program that would inevitably increase tensions with Islamabad and alienate the Pakistani public. We, too, are very concerned about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> history of nuclear proliferation. But this aid bill is clearly not the vehicle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inexplicably, the White House, which insists that bringing stability to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a top national security priority, did not press the leadership to finish the legislation. By the time negotiators managed to find a compromise, it was too late for a vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Congress returns in September, lawmakers and the White House must make passing the aid bill a top priority. Congress must also pass long-stalled legislation to establish special trade preference zones in parts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As President Obama said when he endorsed the aid bill, ''Al Qaeda offers the people of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nothing but destruction. We stand for something different.'' It is time to show the Pakistani people that the United States has more to offer than missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and empty promises. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American missile hit the Mehsud tribal region of South Waziristan on Tuesday, killing at least 10 people in the same area where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban was apparently killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week, Pakistani security officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile struck near the town of Kani Gurram, one of the largest in the area, which is home to the Pakistani Taliban movement. American and Pakistani security officials say they believe the leader of the movement, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the C.I.A. last Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Details of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday were unclear. Reuters reported that the missile had apparently hit a house that was being used by the Taliban, but it was not clear if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed any Taliban commanders. Many of them have reportedly gathered in the area in order to choose Mr. Mehsud's successor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More deaths could be extremely damaging for the Taliban, whose ranks -- according to Pakistani security officials -- are in disarray after the death of Mr. Mehsud. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military says it wants to exploit that weakness but is waiting for the right moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Now it's a fluid situation,'' a Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said in an interview. ''One would like the dust to settle first.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A nearly complete news blackout has settled over South Waziristan, but militants who reached news organizations by telephone have denied the death of Mr. Mehsud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under standard policy for covert operations, C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not publicly acknowledged by the United States government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While American and Pakistani intelligence officials say that the evidence supporting  the death of Mr. Mehsud  is overwhelming, they have not publicly confirmed that he is dead. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials, trying to capitalize on recent and rare military successes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have been delivering strong private messages to military and civilian leaders here to aggressively pursue the Taliban and other militants, including some with close ties to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a series of high-level meetings and phone calls that began after reports that an American airstrike this month had killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, administration officials said they had been prodding the Pakistanis to keep up pressure on the militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The coordinated message to the Pakistanis stems in part from a desire not to waste what administration officials see as an important opportunity to exploit apparent disarray in the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban since the death of Mr. Mehsud, which was corroborated by a senior aide captured on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it also reflects worry among senior American officials that the Pakistani military will now declare victory and go home -- pulling back from its recent offensive in the Swat Valley, and avoiding a similar push into Waziristan, Mr. Mehsud's power base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Suffice it to say that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is somewhere between a 'clear' and 'hold' when it comes to Swat and Waziristan,'' a senior administration official said. ''But the perception in the Pakistani military is that this is a surgical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They go and clear out Swat and Waziristan and then they can go back to fighting the Indians.'' Neighboring India is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> longtime rival. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard C. Holbrooke, President Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on Tuesday personally delivered the message to push on, speaking to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief of staff, and Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence chief, during a visit to Islamabad, administration officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke's meeting with General Kayani followed a similar face-to-face meeting -- with the same message -- between General Kayani and Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the leader of American and NATO combat operations in Afghanistan, who traveled to Islamabad on Monday to see General Kayani, administration officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of American forces in the Middle East, was to be in Islamabad on Wednesday for a meeting with General Kayani and was expected to deliver the same message, administration officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This followed two phone calls between Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kayani during the past week, all part of what one administration official described as a strategy intended to try to get the Pakistani military to maintain a ''constant battle rhythm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The purpose of my meeting today was to express our support and appreciation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S. military cooperation,'' Mr. Holbrooke said Tuesday. ''Second, in particular I wanted to say how impressed we are with the speed with which refugees have been able to return to their homes in Swat. And third, I wanted to encourage greater cooperation going forward.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke, in Islamabad over the past three days, tried three times to visit Swat to independently assess the gains made by the Pakistani military there. All attempts were canceled by the army because of what it called adverse weather, but there also remain lingering security concerns in the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During a meeting on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmad, the commander of the Pakistani military wing leading the Swat reconstruction effort, told Mr. Holbrooke that guerrillas and militants remained in the ''peripheral'' mountain areas, but that the effort to return Swat civilians to their homes was going well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Ahmad said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was facing ''a moment'' which, if manipulated properly, could damage the Taliban for good. ''If we play our cards right and address the root causes of the problem,'' like governance, justice, and the gap between rich and poor, General Ahmad said, the government can win back the tribal areas populated by Taliban militants and other extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But General Ahmad equivocated when Mr. Holbrooke and other American officials pressed him on what steps the Pakistani military was taking to capitalize on the opportunity. General Ahmad said that international organizations and Pakistani government officials were studying what to do next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Holbrooke continues to press Pakistani military leaders to take him to Swat, the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, has yet to make a trip to the region, but says he will. Mr. Zardari told a small group of reporters traveling with Mr. Holbrooke on Tuesday night: ''I do intend to go there. Yes, I do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari called the Swat operation the ''first step in the thought process'' for ridding the country of militants. ''Now everything else will be a journey,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to his talks with Mr. Zardari, General Kayani  and General Pasha, Mr. Holbrooke also spent Tuesday listening to Islamist critics of American policy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including Liaqat  Baloch, the secretary general of the anti-American political party Jamaat-e-Islami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Baloch gave Mr. Holbrook a multipage document of all the ways that, in his group's view, the Americans had failed in the region: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backing Pervez Musharraf, the unpopular former president; infecting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with American culture; and the war in Afghanistan. He told Mr. Holbrooke that Jamaat-e-Islami would not change its views of America until American policy changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holbrooke disputed each of his points, and the two men shook hands and agreed to differ. Afterward, administration officials pointed to the exchange as an example of making good on Mr. Obama's promise to engage the Muslim world, including those who disagreed with American policy. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARACHI, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith A. McHale was expecting a contentious session with Ansar Abbasi, a Pakistani journalist known for his harsh criticism of American foreign policy, when she sat down for a one-on-one meeting with him in a hotel conference room in Islamabad on Monday. She got that, and a little bit more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Ms. McHale, the Obama administration's new under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, gave her initial polite presentation about building bridges between America and the Muslim world, Mr. Abbasi thanked her politely for meeting with him. Then he told her that he hated her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  '' 'You should know that we hate all Americans,' '' Ms. McHale said Mr. Abbasi told her. '' 'From the bottom of our souls, we hate you.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the continuation of the battle against militants along the Pakistani-Afghan border, a big part of President Obama's strategy for the region involves trying to broaden America's involvement in the country to include nonmilitary areas like infrastructure development, trade, energy, schools and jobs -- all aimed at convincing the Pakistani people that the United States is their friend. But as Ms. McHale and other American officials discovered this week, during a visit by Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, making that case was not going to be easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have made a major turn with our relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under President Obama,'' Mr. Holbrooke told reporters at a news conference in Karachi on Wednesday. Time and again, Mr. Holbrooke tried to delineate the differences between the Obama administration and the Bush era, painting the new administration as one that wants to see a better life and more business opportunities for Pakistanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said his very presence in Karachi -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest city and its commercial capital -- demonstrated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the hunt for Al Qaeda were not the only American foreign policy activities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To polite applause, Mr. Holbrooke told local officials at the Governor's House that the United States Consulate in Karachi would start granting business visas --100 a week -- instead of making would-be business travelers to the United States go to Islamabad for the visas, as has been the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He stopped at a shantytown in the city to chat with schoolboys crowded into three classrooms, and even visited the home of a local resident, to get a feel for how people in Karachi live. On Tuesday, he met with opposition leaders in Islamabad, including Liaqat Baloch, the secretary general of the anti-American political party Jamaat-e-Islami, and Fazlur Rehman, the leader of another anti-American party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who is sometimes referred to as the spiritual founder of the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Karachi on Wednesday, Mr. Holbrooke kept bringing up a trade bill that just passed the House, which would set up so-called reconstruction opportunity zones so that textiles and other goods made in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas could get preferential access to the United States market. And Ms. McHale, whose job is, in part, to try to repair America's relations with the Muslim world, strayed from his side only when she ventured out on fence-mending missions of her own, meeting with 17 Pakistani journalists, 8 officials of nongovernmental organizations and members of several political parties, all in an effort to deliver one message: America cares about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Abbasi's reaction -- a response that, Ms. McHale acknowledged, apparently reflects the feelings of about 25 percent of the population, according to a recent poll -- demonstrated just how tough the job is. For all of the administration's efforts to call attention to the nonmilitary ties that would bind the two countries, America is still being judged by many Pakistanis as an uncaring behemoth whose sole concern is finding Osama bin Laden, no matter the cost in civilian Pakistani lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He told me that we were no longer human beings because our goal was to eliminate other humans,'' Ms. McHale said Wednesday, recounting the conversation with Mr. Abbasi.  ''He spoke English very well, and he said that thousands of innocent people have been killed because we are trying to find Osama bin Laden.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Following Mr. Holbrooke's example when he received a similar lashing from Mr. Baloch, Ms. McHale said she argued her points with Mr. Abbasi, points that to many Americans would appear logical, but that often fail to impress over here: Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001; the war in Afghanistan, unlike the war in Iraq, is blessed by the United Nations and is a multinational effort; America will always do whatever it takes to defend itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She said that even though she knew that she did not sway Mr. Abbasi, it was good to hear what he thought because she wanted to try to understand the source of much of the anti-Americanism in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, in Karachi, Mr. Holbrooke continued to push an agenda of soft power, telling business leaders that the United States wanted to invest in energy projects in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  But he acknowledged that some of the  projects that Karachi technocrats put before him, with their complex ownership structures, would never get approval in the Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trade bill, now before the Senate, has labor provisions that are unlikely to get past free-trade Republicans, whose support is needed for it to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And on top of that, in a concession to the United States textile industry, the bill would not include imports  of cotton tops and pants, items that are made in abundance in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Intelligence Agency in 2004 hired outside contractors from the private security contractor Blackwater USA as part of a secret program to locate and assassinate top operatives of Al Qaeda, according to current and former government officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Executives from Blackwater, which has generated controversy because of its aggressive tactics in Iraq, helped the spy agency with planning, training and surveillance. The C.I.A. spent several million dollars on the program, which did not successfully capture or kill any terrorist suspects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fact that the C.I.A. used an outside company for the program was a major reason that Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A.'s director, became alarmed and called an emergency meeting in June to tell Congress that the agency had withheld details of the program for seven years, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear whether the C.I.A. had planned to use the contractors to actually capture or kill Qaeda operatives, or just to help with training and surveillance in the program. American spy agencies have in recent years outsourced some highly controversial work, including the interrogation of prisoners. But government officials said that bringing outsiders into a program with lethal authority raised deep concerns about accountability in covert operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said the C.I.A. did not have a formal contract with Blackwater  for this program but instead had individual agreements with top company officials, including the  founder, Erik D. Prince, a politically connected former member of the Navy Seals and the heir to a  family fortune. Blackwater's work on the program actually ended years before Mr. Panetta took over the agency, after senior C.I.A. officials themselves questioned the wisdom of using outsiders in a targeted killing program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater, which has changed its name, most recently to Xe Services, and is based in North Carolina, in recent years has received millions of dollars in government contracts, growing so large that the Bush administration said it was a necessary part of its war operation in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has also drawn controversy. Blackwater employees hired to guard American diplomats in Iraq were accused of using excessive force on several occasions, including shootings in Baghdad in 2007 in which 17 civilians were killed. Iraqi officials have since refused to give the company an operating license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several current and former government officials interviewed for this article spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing details of a still classified program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paul Gimigliano, a C.I.A. spokesman, declined to provide details about the canceled program, but he said that Mr. Panetta's decision on the assassination program was ''clear and straightforward.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Director Panetta thought this effort should be briefed to Congress, and he did so,'' Mr. Gimigliano said. ''He also knew it hadn't been successful, so he ended it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Xe spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, also declined to give details of the program. But she praised Mr. Panetta for notifying Congress. ''It is too easy to contract out work that you don't want to accept responsibility for,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. this summer conducted an internal review of the assassination program that recently was presented to the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees. The officials said that the review stated that Mr. Panetta's predecessors did not believe that they needed to tell Congress because the program was not far enough developed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The House Intelligence Committee is investigating why lawmakers were never told about the program. According to current and former government officials, former Vice President Dick Cheney told C.I.A. officers in 2002 that the spy agency did not need to inform Congress because the agency already had legal authority to kill Qaeda leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One official familiar with the matter said that Mr. Panetta did not tell lawmakers that he believed that the C.I.A. had broken the law by withholding details about the program from Congress. Rather, the official said, Mr. Panetta said he believed that the program had moved beyond a planning stage and deserved Congressional scrutiny. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's wrong to think this counterterrorism program was confined to briefing slides or doodles on a cafeteria napkin,'' the official said. ''It went well beyond that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Current and former government officials said that the C.I.A.'s efforts to use paramilitary hit teams to kill Qaeda operatives ran into logistical, legal and diplomatic hurdles almost from the outset. These efforts had been run by the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism center, which runs operations against Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2002, Blackwater won a classified contract to provide security for the C.I.A. station in Kabul, Afghanistan, and the company maintains other classified contracts with the C.I.A., current and former officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the years, Blackwater has hired several former top C.I.A. officials, including Cofer Black, who ran the C.I.A. counterterrorism center immediately after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C.I.A. operatives also regularly use the company's  training complex in North Carolina. The complex includes a shooting range used for sniper training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An executive order signed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1976 barred the C.I.A. from carrying out assassinations, a direct response to revelations that the C.I.A. had initiated assassination plots against Fidel Castro of Cuba and other foreign politicians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush administration took the position that killing members of Al Qaeda, a terrorist group that attacked the United States and has pledged to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it again, was no different from killing enemy soldiers in battle, and that therefore the agency was not constrained by the assassination ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But former intelligence officials said that employing private contractors to help hunt Qaeda operatives would pose significant legal and diplomatic risks, and they might not be protected in the same way government employees are. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Congressional Democrats have hinted that the program was just one of many that the Bush administration hid from Congressional scrutiny and have used the episode as a justification to delve deeper into other Bush-era counterterrorism programs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Republicans have criticized Mr. Panetta's decision to cancel the program, saying he created a tempest in a teapot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think there was a little more drama and intrigue than was warranted,'' said Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said that the C.I.A. program was devised partly as an alternative to missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft, which have accidentally killed civilians and cannot be used in urban areas where some terrorists hide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet with most top Qaeda operatives believed to be hiding in the remote mountains of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have remained the C.I.A.'s weapon of choice. Like the Bush administration, the Obama administration has embraced the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign because it presents a less risky option than sending paramilitary teams into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a secret division at its North Carolina headquarters, the company formerly known as Blackwater  has assumed a role in Washington's most important counterterrorism program: the use of remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill Al Qaeda's leaders, according to government officials and current and former employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The division's operations are carried out at hidden bases in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, where the company's contractors assemble and load Hellfire missiles and 500-pound laser-guided bombs on remotely piloted Predator aircraft, work previously performed by employees of the Central Intelligence Agency. They also provide security at the covert bases, the officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The role of the company in the Predator program highlights the degree to which the C.I.A. now depends on outside contractors to perform some of the agency's most important assignments. And it illustrates the resilience of Blackwater, now known as Xe  (pronounced Zee) Services, though most people in and outside the company still refer to it as Blackwater. It has grown through government work, even as it attracted criticism and allegations of brutality in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment for this article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York Times reported Thursday that the agency hired Blackwater in 2004 as part of a secret program to locate and assassinate top Qaeda operatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews on Thursday, current and former government officials provided new details about Blackwater's association with the assassination program, which began in 2004 not long after Porter J. Goss took over at the C.I.A. The officials said that the spy agency did not dispatch the Blackwater executives with a ''license to kill.'' Instead, it ordered the contractors to begin collecting information on the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leaders, carry out surveillance and train for possible missions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The actual pulling of a trigger in some ways is the easiest part, and the part that requires the least expertise,'' said one government official familiar with the canceled C.I.A. program. ''It's everything that leads up to it that's the meat of the issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any operation to capture or kill militants would have had to have been approved by the C.I.A. director and presented to the White House before it was carried out, the officials said. The agency's current director, Leon E. Panetta, canceled the program and notified Congress of its existence in an emergency meeting in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The extent of Blackwater's business dealings with the C.I.A. has largely been hidden, but its public contract with the State Department to provide private security to American diplomats in Iraq has generated intense scrutiny and controversy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company lost the job in Iraq this year, after Blackwater guards were involved in shootings in 2007 that left 17 Iraqis  dead. It still has other, less prominent State Department work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five former Blackwater guards have been indicted in federal court on charges related to the 2007 episode. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman for Xe did not respond to a request for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For its intelligence work, the company's sprawling headquarters in North Carolina has a special division, known as Blackwater Select. The company's first major arrangement with the C.I.A. was signed in 2002, with a contract to provide security for the agency's new station in Kabul, Afghanistan. Blackwater employees assigned to the Predator bases receive training at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to learn how to load Hellfire missiles and laser-guided smart bombs on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to current and former employees, who asked not to be identified for fear of upsetting the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. has for several years operated Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out of a remote base in Shamsi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but has secretly added a second site at an air base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, several current and former government and company officials said. The existence of the Predator base in Jalalabad has not previously been reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said the C.I.A. now conducted most of its Predator missile and bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on  targets in the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border region from the Jalalabad base, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> landing or taking off almost hourly. The base in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is still in use. But officials said that the United States decided to open the Afghanistan operation in part because of the possibility that the Pakistani government, facing growing anti-American sentiment at home, might force the C.I.A. to close the one in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater is not involved in selecting targets or actual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The targets are selected by the C.I.A., and employees at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., pull the trigger remotely. Only a handful of the agency's employees actually work at the Predator bases in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the current and former employees said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said that Blackwater's direct role in these operations had sometimes led to disputes with the C.I.A. Sometimes when a Predator misses a target, agency employees accuse Blackwater of poor bomb assembly, they said. In one instance last year recounted by the employees, a 500-pound bomb dropped off a Predator before it hit the target, leading to a  frantic search for the unexploded bomb in the remote Afghan-Pakistani border region. It was eventually found about 100 yards from the original target. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The role of contractors in intelligence work expanded after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as spy agencies were forced to fill gaps created when their work forces were reduced during the 1990s, after the end of the cold war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than a quarter of the intelligence community's current work force is made up of contractors, carrying out missions like intelligence collection and analysis and, until recently, interrogation of terrorist suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are skills we don't have in government that we may have an immediate requirement for,'' Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who ran the C.I.A. from 2006 until early this year, said during a panel discussion on Thursday on the privatization of intelligence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Hayden, who succeeded Mr. Goss at the agency, acknowledged that the C.I.A. program continued under his watch, though it was not a priority. He said the program was never prominent during his time at the C.I.A., which was one reason he did not believe that he had to notify Congress.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By RICHARD N. HAASS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of ''War of Necessity, War of Choice: A Memoir of Two Iraq Wars.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">874 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPEAKING on Monday to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Phoenix, President Obama could not have been more definitive. ''We must never forget,'' he said of the conflict in Afghanistan. ''This is not a war of choice. This is a war of necessity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president did not break new ground so much as reinforce existing policy. Earlier this year, he decided to send an additional 17,000 combat soldiers and 4,000 trainers to Afghanistan, raising American force levels there to more than 60,000. And in March he articulated a broader mission: The United States would now ''take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east,'' in effect making the United States a full party to Afghanistan's civil war. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, American soldiers are fighting the Taliban, partly to provide time and space while Afghan forces are better trained and partly to persuade some Taliban that resistance does not pay. Call it armed state-building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But is Afghanistan a war of necessity? And if not -- if in fact it is a war of choice -- so what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wars of necessity must meet two tests. They involve, first, vital national interests and, second, a lack of viable alternatives to the use of military force to protect those interests. World War II was a war of necessity, as were the Korean War and the Persian Gulf war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the wake of 9/11, invading Afghanistan was a war of necessity. The United States needed to act in self-defense to oust the Taliban. There was no viable alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, however, with a friendly government in Kabul, is our military presence still a necessity? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, our interests in Afghanistan include making it difficult for Al Qaeda to mount operations from that country and limiting Taliban use of Afghan territory to destabilize neighboring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Minimizing the chance of a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American citizens is vital, as is making sure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear arsenal doesn't fall into the wrong hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even if the United States were to succeed in Afghanistan -- with ''success'' defined as bringing into existence an Afghan government strong enough to control most of its territory -- terrorists could still operate from there and would put down roots elsewhere. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> future would remain uncertain at best. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, there are alternatives to current American policy. One would reduce our troops' ground-combat operations and emphasize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on terrorists, the training of Afghan police officers and soldiers, development aid and diplomacy to fracture the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A more radical alternative would withdraw all United States military forces from Afghanistan and center on regional and global counterterrorism efforts and homeland security initiatives to protect ourselves from threats that might emanate from Afghanistan. Under this option, our policy toward Afghanistan would resemble the approach toward Somalia and other countries where governments are unable or unwilling to take on terrorists and the United States eschews military intervention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghanistan is thus a war of choice -- Mr. Obama's war of choice. In this way, Afghanistan is analogous to Vietnam, Bosnia, Kosovo and today's Iraq. Wars of choice are not inherently good or bad. It depends on whether military involvement would probably accomplish more than it would cost and whether employing force is more promising than the alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Making this assessment in Afghanistan is difficult. The Taliban are resourceful and patient and can use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a sanctuary. It is not obvious that Afghans can overcome ethnic and tribal loyalties, corruption and personal rivalries. No matter who is declared the winner, yesterday's election is almost certain to leave the country even more divided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The risk of ending our military effort in Afghanistan is that Kabul could be overrun and the government might fall. The risk of the current approach (or even one that involves dispatching another 10,000 or 20,000 American soldiers, as the president appears likely to do) is that it might produce the same result in the end, but at a higher human, military and economic cost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of which makes Afghanistan not just a war of choice but a tough choice. My judgment is that American interests are sufficiently important, prospects for achieving limited success are sufficiently high and the risks of alternative policies are sufficiently great to proceed, for now, with Mr. Obama's measured strategy. But the administration, Congress and the American people (who, recent polls suggest, are turning against the war) must undertake regular, rigorous assessments of whether these efforts are bearing fruit or are likely to. If it appears they are not, the president should roll back the combat role or withdraw militarily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Afghanistan were a war of necessity, it would justify any level of effort. It is not and does not. It is not certain that doing more will achieve more. And no one should forget that doing more in Afghanistan lessens our ability to act elsewhere, including North Korea, Iran and Iraq. There needs to be a limit to what the United States does in Afghanistan and how long it is prepared to do it, lest we find ourselves unable to contend with other wars, of choice or of necessity, if and when they arise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior leader of the Pakistani Taliban announced Saturday that a brash young commander with a reputation for pitiless violence appeared to have won the struggle  to lead the group -- even as the government wrestles with conflicting information about  whether that commander is even alive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence officials in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say that the newly proclaimed leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is dead. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interior minister, Rehman Malik, said Saturday in an interview that he was alive, although gravely injured, and that Taliban fighters were desperately searching for his younger brother as a stand-in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The news on Saturday adds to  the confusion that has surrounded the leadership of the group since its head, Baitullah Mehsud, was reportedly killed this month in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maulvi Faqir Muhammad, deputy commander of the group, had proclaimed himself  successor to  Baitullah Mehsud just a few days ago. But on Saturday he told reporters by telephone that the much younger and more aggressive Hakimullah Mehsud would be the insurgency's new leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am abdicating the leadership of the Tehrik-e-Taliban in the larger interests of the movement,'' said Mr. Faqir Muhammad, the group's leader from the Bajaur tribal region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He acknowledged the confusion about who was actually running the Pakistani Taliban, an insurgency with close links to Al Qaeda. The group's top leaders have been feuding over control of its vast assets, including cash and weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were a few problems on certain issues last week,'' he acknowledged. ''But those issues have been resolved.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Faqir Muhammad was the second in command, he does not have roots in South Waziristan, the heartland of the Pakistani Taliban, which would have made it harder for him to take the helm. Hakimullah Mehsud, however, is from the Shabi Khel branch of the Mehsud tribe, as was the group's former leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Faqir Muhammad said that a 42-member council met in Orakzai, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> separately administered tribal areas, and that it unanimously endorsed Hakimullah Mehsud as the new leader of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hakimullah Mehsud once served as a driver of the former Taliban leader and was considered very close to him. Aggressive and violent, the young militant commander was widely considered likely to succeed his mentor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik, the interior minister, compared Hakimullah Mehsud to Idi Amin, the bloodthirsty former Ugandan military dictator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has the same personality traits,'' Mr. Malik said. ''He will pull out a gun and kill his own people.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even the government cannot agree on whether Mr. Mehsud is alive or not. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intelligence services continue to believe that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a shootout after a brawl with another contender for the top slot at a meeting soon after Baitullah Mehsud's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is dead and there is no question about it,'' a senior security official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, the government has yet to put fully to rest questions about whether even Baitullah Mehsud really is dead because it has not been able to produce convincing evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Faqir Muhammad insisted that the elder Mr. Mehsud was alive, but that he had gone into seclusion for health reasons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Security officials said Mr. Faqir Muhammad's announcement of the appointment was not a sure sign that the infighting over succession was over. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The announcement is just a fillip and a ruse to gain enough time to allow the T.T.P. to regain control of the leadership,'' one  official said, referring to Tehrik-e-Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- President Obama had not even taken office before supporters were etching his likeness onto Mount Rushmore as another Abraham Lincoln or the second coming of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet what if they got the wrong predecessor? What if Mr. Obama is fated to be another Lyndon B. Johnson instead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, such historical analogies are overly simplistic and fatally flawed, if only because each presidency is distinct in its own way. But the L.B.J. model -- a president who aspired to reshape America at home while fighting a losing war abroad -- is one that haunts Mr. Obama's White House as it seeks to salvage Afghanistan while enacting an expansive domestic program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this summer of discontent for Mr. Obama, as the heady early days give way to the grinding battle for elusive goals, he looks ahead to an uncertain future not only for his legislative agenda but for what has indisputably become his war. Last week's elections in Afghanistan played out at the same time as the debate over health care heated up in Washington,  producing one of those split-screen moments that could not help but remind some of Mr. Johnson's struggles to build a Great Society while fighting in Vietnam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The analogy of Lyndon Johnson suggests itself very profoundly,'' said David M. Kennedy, the Stanford University historian. Mr. Obama, he said, must avoid letting Afghanistan shadow his presidency as Vietnam did Mr. Johnson's. ''He needs to worry about the outcome of that intervention and policy and how it could spill over into everything else he wants to accomplish.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By several accounts, that risk weighs on Mr. Obama these days. Mr. Kennedy was among a group of historians who had dinner with Mr. Obama at the White House earlier this summer where the president expressed concern that Afghanistan could yet hijack his presidency. Although Mr. Kennedy said he could not discuss the off-the-record conversation, others in the room said Mr. Obama acknowledged the L.B.J. risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He said he has a problem,'' said one person who attended that dinner at the end of June, insisting on anonymity to share private discussions. ''This is not just something he can turn his back on and walk away from. But it's an issue he understands could be a danger to his administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another person there was Robert Caro, the L.B.J. biographer who was struck that Mr. Johnson made some of his most fateful decisions about Vietnam in the same dining room. ''All I could think of when I was sitting there and this subject came up was the setting,'' he said. ''You had such an awareness of how things can go wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without quoting what the president said, Mr. Caro said it was clear Mr. Obama understood that precedent. ''Any president with a grasp of history -- and it seems to me President Obama has a deep understanding of history -- would have to be very aware of what happened in another war to derail a great domestic agenda,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghanistan, of course, is not exactly Vietnam. At its peak, the United States had about 500,000 troops in Vietnam, compared with about 68,000 now set for Afghanistan, and most of those fighting in the 1960s were draftees as opposed to volunteer soldiers. Vietnam, therefore, reached deeper into American society, touching more homes and involving more unwilling participants. But the politics of the two seem to evoke comparisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just as Mr. Johnson believed he had no choice but to fight in Vietnam to contain communism, Mr. Obama last week portrayed Afghanistan as the bulwark against international terrorism. ''This is not a war of choice,'' he told the Veterans of Foreign Wars at their convention in Phoenix. ''This is a war of necessity. Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again. If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while many Americans once shared that view, polls suggest that conviction is fading nearly eight years into the war. The share of Americans who said the war in Afghanistan was worth fighting slipped below 50 percent in a survey released last week by The Washington Post and ABC News.  A July poll by the New York Times and CBS News showed that 57 percent of Americans think things are going badly for the United States in Afghanistan, compared with 33 percent who think they are going well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That growing disenchantment in the countryside is increasingly mirrored in Washington, where liberals in Congress are speaking out more vocally against the Afghan war and newspapers are filled with more columns questioning America's involvement.  The cover of the latest Economist is headlined ''Afghanistan: The Growing Threat of Failure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard N. Haass, a former Bush administration official turned critic, wrote in The New York Times last week that what he once considered a war of necessity has become a war of choice. While he still supports it, he argued that there are now alternatives to a large-scale troop presence, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on suspected terrorists, more development aid and expanded training of Afghan police and soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   His former boss, George W. Bush, learned first-hand how political capital can slip away when an overseas war loses popular backing. With Iraq in flames, Mr. Bush found little support for his second-term domestic agenda of overhauling Social Security and liberalizing immigration laws. L.B.J. managed to create Medicare and enact landmark civil rights legislation but some historians have argued that the Great Society ultimately stalled because of Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has launched a new strategy intended to turn Afghanistan around, sending an additional 21,000 troops, installing a new commander, promising more civilian reconstruction help, shifting to more protection of the population and building up Afghan security forces. It is a strategy that some who study Afghanistan believe could make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even some who agree worry that time is running out at home, particularly if the strategy does not produce results quickly.  Success is so hard to imagine that Richard Holbrooke, Mr. Obama's special representative for Afghanistan, this month came up with this definition: ''We'll know it when we see it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The consequences of failure go beyond just Afghanistan. Next door is its volatile neighbor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> armed with nuclear weapons and already seething with radical anti-American elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It could all go belly up and we could run out of public support,'' said Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy. ''The immediate danger is we don't explain to Americans how long things take. I certainly get questions like, 'Is the new strategy turning things around? Is the civilian surge working?' We're not going to even get all of those people on the ground for months.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others are not so sure that the new strategy will make a difference regardless of how much time it is given. No matter who is eventually declared the winner of last week's election in Afghanistan, the government there remains so plagued by corruption and inefficiency that it has limited legitimacy with the Afghan public. Just as America was frustrated with successive South Vietnamese governments, it has grown sour on Afghanistan's leaders with little obvious recourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lt. Col. Douglas A. Ollivant, a retired Army officer who worked on Iraq on the National Security Council staff first for Mr. Bush and then for Mr. Obama, said Afghanistan may be ''several orders of magnitude'' harder. It has none of the infrastructure, education and natural resources of Iraq, he noted, nor is the political leadership as aligned in its goals with those of America's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're in a place where we don't have good options and that's what everyone is struggling with,'' Colonel Ollivant said. ''Sticking it out seems to be a 10-year project and I'm not sure we have the political capital and financial capital to do that. Yet withdrawing, the cost of that seems awfully high as well. So we have the wolf by the ear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And as L.B.J. discovered, the wolf has sharp teeth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani Taliban leaders acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that their leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was dead, confirming claims of American and Pakistani officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The acknowledgment of Mr. Mehsud's death came as rights groups were demanding an inquiry into reports of extrajudicial killings in the Swat Valley, where dozens of bodies have surfaced in execution-style killings in areas where the Pakistani military has conducted operations to push out Taliban militants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army denies any involvement in extrajudicial killings and says the deaths could be acts of revenge by local residents who suffered when the Taliban controlled the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American and Pakistani officials had said they were all but certain that Mr. Mehsud, who had accepted responsibility for a string of deadly terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the country in recent years, had been killed in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Aug. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani intelligence officials also said there were indications of violent infighting over who would succeed him, and reported briefly that one of his possible successors, Hakimullah Mehsud, had been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on Tuesday, Taliban leaders tried to dispel reports of Hakimullah Mehsud's death or the impression of a rift in their leadership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two men claiming to be Hakimullah Mehsud and Waliur Rahman, another Taliban commander, contacted several media outlets to confirm Baitullah Mehsud's death and put up a unified front. They also announced that Hakimullah Mehsud would take over leadership of the Pakistani Taliban, while Mr. Rahman would lead the Taliban in South Waziristan, the rugged tribal region that had been Baitullah Mehsud's stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Pakistani officials immediately cast doubt on the claims and about whether Hakimullah Mehsud was alive or dead. The Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, contends that Hakimullah Mehsud is dead. Analysts said the public admission of Baitullah Mehsud's death came after it became increasingly difficult for the Taliban to continue denying it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rahimullah Yousafzai, an analyst and journalist based in Peshawar, speaking to the Geo television network, said the Taliban initially thought they could hide Mr. Mehsud's killing. ''It wasn't possible for them to hide it and eventually they have admitted now,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, in the northern Swat Valley, villagers and district officials have found dozens of bodies of suspected militants in the past two weeks. Three bodies were found in the Danagram area on the outskirts of Swat's central town of Mingora on Tuesday morning, the BBC reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the dead had multiple gunshot wounds and were found dumped in fields and alleys while blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week the Human Rights Commission of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an independent rights group, put out a statement rebutting the military's denial of involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The commission reiterates that it has come across credible accounts of extrajudicial killings and complaints of reprisal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the security forces during the operation in Swat,'' Asma Jahangir, the chairwoman of the commission, said in the statement. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide attacker pretending to offer food to a group of tribal police officers detonated his explosives among them on Thursday, killing at least 22 people as they gathered to break the Ramadan fast on the Afghanistan-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border, officials and witnesses said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Torkham, a post on the main route for moving supplies to NATO and American forces in Afghanistan, took place just before dusk, as the men prepared to eat on the lawn outside their barracks. Because the attacker offered food, he was welcomed to join the gathering in accordance with local tradition during Ramadan, said Sajid Khan, a policeman who witnessed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A militant group affiliated with the Taliban later claimed responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a spokesman for the group called a local reporter to warn of further </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against security forces if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not stop NATO supplies from passing through its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Medical workers described a chaotic scene at the local hospital and the blast site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So far, we have 22 bodies brought here, but there are many others, so we don't know the exact casualty figures,'' said Zar Alam Shinwari, a local doctor. ''We have asked for ambulances from other towns. The situation is bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear how many of the dead were police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group that claimed responsibility, the Dr. Abdullah Azzam Brigade, is based in the Orakzai tribal region and is named after a fiery Palestinian scholar who was a mentor to Osama bin Laden and was killed in a car bomb in Peshawar in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier on Thursday, at least six people were killed in the South Waziristan tribal region in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a remotely controlled United States aircraft aimed at a meeting of local Taliban militants, according to security officials in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took place in the town of Kanigurram, in an area considered to be a stronghold of Waliur Rehman, the man the Taliban chose as its regional leader after Baitullah Mehsud,  the head of the Pakistani Taliban, died from injuries suffered in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of dead from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could rise and that it could include some foreign militants. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taliban fighters have long used this city of 17 million as a place to regroup, smuggle weapons and even work seasonal jobs. But recently they have discovered another way to make fast money: organized crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police here say the Taliban, working with criminal groups, are using Mafia-style networks to kidnap, rob banks and extort, generating millions of dollars for the militant insurgency in northwestern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is overwhelming evidence that it's an organized policy,'' said Dost Ali Baloch, assistant inspector general of the Karachi police. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is where they come to hide, where they raise their finances,'' said a counterterrorism official in Karachi. ''They don't want to disturb that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The danger is not of a Taliban takeover -- Karachi is run by a powerful secular party that despises the Taliban -- but of an urban sanctuary for financing and equipping the insurgency from this southern port. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These criminal syndicates helped drive kidnappings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year to their highest numbers in a decade, according to the police, and they have also generated a spike in bank robberies. Eighty percent of bank heists are now believed to be related to the insurgency and other militant groups, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Taliban are a group of thieves,'' said a currency exchange owner here who was robbed of nearly $2 million last year and who did not want to be identified for fear of further trouble. ''If it was God, they'd steal from him, too.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani counterterrorism officials say they believe that kidnapping for ransom may have been the single largest revenue source for the Taliban's top commander in the country, Baitullah Mehsud, before he was killed this month in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, Mr. Mehsud's network may have held as many as 70 hostages, said a Pakistani counterterrorism official who did not speak for attribution for reasons of protocol. Control over these criminal networks and the money they generate may have been at the center of what seemed to be the struggle over who would succeed Mr. Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The world thinks this is about religion, but that's a mistake,'' said Sharfuddin Memon, director in Karachi of the Citizens Police Liaison Committee, a crime watch group run by members of the business community. ''It's about money and power. Faith has nothing to do with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The kidnappers who took Shawkat Afridi, a prominent businessman, last year, did not make a single mistake, the family said. A caller breathed his demands into the phone in a bewildering array of accents. First he sounded like an Afghan. Then like a Mehsud tribesman. After more than 50 phone calls over five months, Mr. Afridi's family finally agreed to pay $2.5 million for his release. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We understood he was not an ordinary kidnapper,'' said Gul Afridi, the victim's brother. ''There was no way out.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Typical of such cases, the group, which the police said was Taliban-related, had chosen its target carefully: the Afridis are rich businessmen who supply fuel to NATO forces in Afghanistan. Other recent cases include a prominent film distributor, the owner of a textile mill and a personnel manager at a pipe manufacturer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though just 10 percent of kidnappings are connected to the Taliban, according to the police, the ransoms they generate -- generally $60,000 to $250,000 each -- collect more money than all the other cases combined. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're real professionals,'' said Ahmed Chinoy, a textile manufacturer who is the deputy head of the citizens committee, which was established in 1989 by the business community to protect against encroaching crime. ''They know for sure that whoever they take can afford to pay.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The same goes for bank robberies. Raja Umer Khattab, a senior police officer in Karachi's Special Investigations Unit, noticed something strange early last year. The robbers had beards and bigger than usual guns, and, unlike ordinary thieves, they tended to kill the security guards. They were taking the banks' surveillance systems, along with the cash. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We started seeing a different kind of crime -- more professional, more aggressive,'' he said in an interview. ''We realized these criminals were linked to jihadis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Khattab dug further. These criminals switched cellphone SIM cards like bus tickets, and had a code word for every neighborhood. Last August he made a series of arrests and a bomb exploded under his car. Shrapnel scars still mark his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A recent influx of people in Karachi displaced by the military's offensive in the northwest has expanded opportunities for the Taliban. Many are Pashtuns, the ethnic group most closely associated with the Taliban. Fanned by local politicians, ethnic tensions erupted in clashes that killed dozens this spring in Karachi. The authorities say Taliban-related crime has dropped greatly since then, with the arrests of the crime leaders breaking networks, among them, the gang that kidnapped Mr. Afridi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many of the networks are still in place, crisscrossing the city like a web, with strong links to Taliban sanctuaries in the northwest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the case of the heist at the money exchange last year, two security guards, who were from the Mehsud tribe, carried out the robbery. The exchange's owners believed the men were working directly for Mr. Mehsud. They were uneducated and had been told that the exchange was taking money from the C.I.A. and that its dollars were the proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They were brainwashed,'' said one of the owners, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. ''They were told, if you do this, it's good for Islam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In many ways, it is the Pashtuns who suffer most. Militants extort money from the biggest oil traders to the smallest house servants, and Pashtuns can do little to resist, because their families remain in areas that the militants control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shahid, 22, a shy  servant in Karachi, squirms when he describes how half of his $100 monthly salary goes to the local militant commander in his village, near the Afghan border. He did not want his full name used for fear of Taliban retribution. The commander was once a bus conductor, but has grown rich in his position, hoarding more than 200 sport utility vehicles, Shahid said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Refusing has consequences: Four who recently fought the extortion turned up dead, Shahid said. Their bodies were not allowed a burial in the village, a sign of shame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we give, we're in trouble, and if we don't give, we're in trouble,'' said Abzal Khan Mehsud, a member of the Oil Tanker Owners Association, who said he had not been able to go to his village for years out of fear of the militants who control it. ''We're being ground down in between.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a gritty industrial area of north Karachi, businessmen have taken matters into their own hands. Idrees Gigi, a textile manufacturer, is building a tall cement wall along the edge of his property. On the other side is Sorabgoth, a bone-poor Pashtun neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hope is that the wall will help shield his factory from crime,  but security precautions do nothing to address the real problem, which Mr. Gigi believes is poverty. Partsof Sorabgoth lack roads and running water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a recent Saturday, young men scrambled past the  wall over a river of red wastewater across a footbridge made of drainage chutes. Mr. Gigi employs  thousands of residents, and has built four schools, but it is not enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The worse the economy is, the more jihadis it will create,'' he said. ''This is a money war.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the United States need a large and growing ground force in Afghanistan to prevent another major terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In deploying 68,000 American troops there by year's end, President Obama has called Afghanistan ''a war of necessity'' to prevent the Taliban from recreating for Al Qaeda the sanctuary that it had in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But nearly eight years after the American invasion drove Qaeda leaders from Afghanistan, the political support for military action that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has faded. A war that started as a swift counterattack against those responsible for the murder of 3,000 Americans, a growing number of critics say, is in danger of becoming a quagmire with a muddled mission. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews, most counterterrorism experts said they believed that the troops were needed to drive Taliban fighters from territory they had steadily reclaimed. But critics on the right and the left say that if the real goal is to prevent terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States, there may be alternatives to a large ground force in Afghanistan. They say Al Qaeda can be held at bay using intensive intelligence, Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cruise missiles, raids by Special Operations commandos and even payments to warlords to deny haven to Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all, they point out, the Central Intelligence Agency has killed more than a dozen top Qaeda leaders in the lawless Pakistani tribal areas, disrupting the terrorists' ability to plot and carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the United States and Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew J. Bacevich, professor of international relations at Boston University, said the alternatives would have at least as much chance of preventing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States as a large-scale counterinsurgency effort, which he said would last 5 to 10 years, require hundreds of billions of dollars, sacrifice hundreds of American lives and have a ''slim likelihood of success.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the Obama administration's assertions that it has a new approach, ''the truth is they want to try harder to do what we've been doing for the last eight years,'' Mr. Bacevich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But most specialists on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, inside and outside the government, say terrorism cannot be confronted from a comfortable distance, such as by airstrikes or proxy forces alone. It may take years to turn Afghanistan into a place that is hostile to Al Qaeda, they say, but it may be the only way to keep the United States safe in the long term. Many agree with the classified strategy for a troop buildup that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, has presented to Mr. Obama and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They say a large American-led NATO ground force is needed to clear Taliban-held territory and hold it while instructors train sufficient, competent Afghan soldiers and police officers to secure those areas. The allied force, the argument goes, will buy time and space to help the Afghans build more effective local, provincial and national governments, and create some semblance of an economy. Since many polls in Afghanistan show little support for the Taliban, a stable, peaceful country would not be likely to become a home for terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration's ''clear, hold, build'' strategy is meant to win over Afghans. It is based on the counterinsurgency principle of protecting the population -- or, in this case, at least Afghan population centers -- to win confidence and support, before isolating remaining insurgents to be killed or captured. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have maintained that the United States cannot fight terrorists from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The notion that you can conduct a purely counterterrorist kind of campaign and do it from a distance simply does not accord with reality,'' Mr. Gates told reporters last Thursday. ''The reality is that even if you want to focus on counterterrorism, you cannot do that successfully without local law enforcement, without internal security, without intelligence.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, concurred, saying the argument that terrorism can be prevented essentially by remote control was ''immensely seductive'' -- and completely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We tried to contain the terrorism problem in Afghanistan from a distance before 9/11,'' he said. ''Look how well that worked.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Airstrikes risk killing civilians -- as shown by international concern over the possibility that many civilians were among the scores killed in the NATO bombing of two fuel tankers in northern Afghanistan last week -- and making enemies of the very people American commanders are trying to sway. General McChrystal recently tightened rules on airstrikes to try to avert civilian deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hoffman said the success of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Predators in killing Qaeda suspects in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> depended on accurate information on terrorists' whereabouts from Pakistani intelligence. In Afghanistan, without such sources, ''we'd be flying blind,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Disengagement from Afghanistan could destabilize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and ''guarantee'' a future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States from the region, Mr. Hoffman said. For starters, a pullout could deny the United States bases from which it carries out some Predator missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By all accounts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remains the wild card that complicates all predictions on Afghanistan. Proponents of the increased American force in Afghanistan say a withdrawal would reinforce </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fears that the United States is not committed to security in the region, encouraging an old Pakistani strategy of maintaining ties to Islamic militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Daniel L. Byman, director of Georgetown's Center for Peace and Security Studies, said calculations on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> role were complicated. ''The more we escalate in Afghanistan, the more we depend on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for logistics,'' he said, ''and the more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may feel it can resist our pressure to go after the militants.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As opposition to the war in Afghanistan builds, some of Mr. Obama's strongest supporters say he must do a better job of explaining how deploying a large American ground force there safeguards Americans at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He needs to reinforce that message more frequently and to the point,'' said Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee who just returned from Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''He hasn't made it enough.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain ordered a predawn commando raid in northern Afghanistan on Wednesday to rescue a British reporter for The New York Times and his Afghan interpreter after Afghan agents learned that the Taliban was planning to move the hostages into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a senior Afghan official said Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The raid by British Special Forces and Afghan soldiers freed the reporter, Stephen Farrell, but the interpreter, Sultan Munadi, and a British paratrooper were killed in a fierce firefight, as were least one Afghan civilian and dozens of Taliban fighters, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Afghan official and Mr. Farrell described a situation where after two days in captivity, the hostages' situation turned more menacing. They said it seemed likely that Taliban leaders from outside the immediate district in Kunduz Province were planning to move the captives across the border into neighboring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, largely outside the reach of NATO forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Farrell said he was treated well -- given food, water and blankets and never harmed -- the militants increasingly taunted Mr. Munadi. At one point one of the Taliban reminded Mr. Munadi of a case two years ago in which an Italian journalist taken hostage in Helmand Province was freed while his Afghan translator was beheaded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I did not think they were going to kill me,'' Mr. Farrell said Wednesday in a telephone interview from the British Embassy in Kabul. ''I did think they were going to kill him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban captors talked freely on their telephones, increasing the chances that NATO eavesdroppers also picked up on the change in mood and believed time was running short to act. ''My sense is they probably just got them in the right place and needed to get on to it,'' said Peter Gilchrist, a retired British major general and a former senior commander in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior American military official in Washington said that the United States provided intelligence assistance and helicopters for the mission, and had </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft at the ready if needed, but that the operation was planned and carried out by British commanders and civilian officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior NATO spokesman in Afghanistan, Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, said that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in the country, was informed of the raid after it took place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Times of London reported on its Web site on Wednesday that Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain personally approved the raid. But other British officials said Mr. Brown gave only general authorization to the military to rescue Mr. Farrell, who has dual British and Irish citizenship, and Mr. Munadi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, Mr. Brown said the raid was a British operation supported by the Afghan authorities and NATO allies, including the United States. He praised the heroism of the British commandos and confirmed ''with very deep sadness'' the death of one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This operation was carried out after extensive planning and consideration,'' Mr. Brown said, adding that whenever ''British nationals are kidnapped, we and our allies will do everything in our power to free them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sadly, we were unable to rescue Stephen's Afghan interpreter, Sultan Munadi, and we send his family our condolences,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Hamid Karzai ''strongly condemned the killing of an experienced Afghan journalist,'' his office said in a statement on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse. The statement said Mr. Munadi ''was killed mercilessly by the enemies of Afghanistan'' -- shorthand for Taliban insurgents -- but did not give further details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Neither The Times nor Mr. Farrell's family knew that the military operation was taking place. But they had discussed with the military under what conditions they might attempt a rescue. Basically the answer was they might act if they had intelligence that they could act on quickly and with a high probability of success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gunmen seized Mr. Farrell and Mr. Munadi on Saturday while they were working in a village near Kunduz. They were reporting on the aftermath of NATO airstrikes on Friday that blew up two fuel tankers hijacked by Taliban militants and killed scores of people, including an uncertain number of civilians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Farrell, speaking to colleagues at The Times, said that he and Mr. Munadi were moved several times a day amid the cornfields, rice plantations and mud-brick villages in the Char Dara district over their four days of captivity. In the first two days, he said, they felt optimistic that they would be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They drove us around Char Dara, almost always in the same old Toyota Corolla, sometimes with masked and turbaned motorcycle outriders, rocket-propelled grenades sticking out of backpacks in full daylight, just a few miles from the main Kabul to Kunduz road,'' Mr. Farrell said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said his captors delighted in showing off, at one point driving to within about 1,500 feet of Afghan government and NATO watch towers, gleeful at their daring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The area of Kunduz Province where they were held is ethnically mixed, with Tajiks and Pashtuns living in separate villages. But there was no doubt who was in charge. ''At no point did we see a single NATO soldier, Afghan policeman, soldier or any check to the Taliban's ability to move at will,'' Mr. Farrell said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Six to eight guards took turns watching the hostages, and they were hugely unpredictable. ''One became enraged when I urinated standing up, deeming it an offense to local families,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''He then calmed down and asked me to teach him how to count to 10 in English.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on the third day, the situation became more threatening. It became harder for the captors to find safe houses. They would get lost driving down ever-narrower and ever more obscure country lanes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When they finally found a house with electricity two youngsters produced a tape recorder and began blaring hours of religious sermons, praising Osama bin Laden, the mujahedeen of Chechnya, Somalia, Helmand, Kandahar and anyone fighting the Americans,'' Mr. Farrell said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some new Taliban figures, evidently more senior, arrived on the scene. There was much discussion of moving the captives outside the Kunduz area, including to Baghlan, a medium-size city not far from the sanctuaries of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Waziristan in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Munadi became worried about his own fate, and told Mr. Farrell, ''I think you're going to be O.K., but they've got it in for me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late on the third night, loud explosions nearby and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of aircraft overhead sent the captors and their hostages into the darkness, racing across open fields. It was a false alarm, but with a waning moon Mr. Farrell warned Mr. Munadi that a rescue attempt could be coming soon. Indeed, it would. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At about 2:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, the allied helicopters descended on the hideout and disgorged the British commandos. British and NATO officials have refused to discuss details of the operations, but most of the nations with sizable forces in Afghanistan keep a special military hostage-rescue team at the ready for occasions just like this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and helicopters overhead, the captors scattered, Mr. Farrell said. The two men initially stayed put, fearing that they would be caught in any cross-fire. Then one of the captors came back and tipped his gun toward them, he said, but left without firing. ''We absolutely expected them to cut us down as they ran,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''We were crouching targets in a long, narrow room devoid of anything but walls and matting, which felt like a death trap.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two men waited a bit, then made their way out of the room into a courtyard. The lost each other in the darkness for a moment, before linking back up. With Mr. Munadi leading, they scuttled along a narrow ledge on  the outer wall of the compound. ''We could see nothing more than a few feet in front of us,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''We had no idea who was where, and there were bullets flying through the air.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After crouching and running for some 60 feet, the two men got to a corner. Mr. Munadi was about two feet ahead of Mr. Farrell, and walked out into the clearing saying in an accent, ''Journaliste, journaliste.'' It was not clear whether he was assuring commandos that he was not a Talib, or assuring the Taliban that he was not with the commandos. There was a hail of bullets -- unclear whether from friend or foe -- and Mr. Munadi fell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Farrell said he reared back from the gunfire and dived into a ditch. He waited a couple of minutes until he was clear which direction the British voices were coming from, then shouted, ''British hostage! British hostage!'' A few seconds later with hands raised high, he walked to the British troops and safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, Mr. Farrell blamed himself for Mr. Munadi's death, though he said the two of them discussed while in captivity the possibility that they might not survive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Farrell said of his colleague, ''He was trying to protect me up to the last minute.'' As they left the room under commando siege, ''he moved out in front of me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was three seconds away from safety,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''I thought we were safe. He just walked into a hail of bullets.'' </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top commander for Al Qaeda has been killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an American missile fired from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Pakistani intelligence officials said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials, who spoke anonymously under security rules, said the Qaeda commander, Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10 days earlier in the border area of North Waziristan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kashmiri was considered by some intelligence officials to be one of the 10 most wanted militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Although they said his body had not been found, agents were sent to his home village, Bahawalpur, to verify his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile struck a compound in the village of Machi Khel, and a security official said five other militants were killed and at least three others wounded. A local resident said the five dead fighters were Uzbeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been especially successful recently against high-profile Taliban and Qaeda leaders, although reliable identification of the victims can be difficult. After such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insurgents typically cordon off the area and quickly remove any bodies to prevent security forces from taking them for DNA tests. Burials are often in unmarked graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani officials also said a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday had probably killed a Qaeda lieutenant from Uzbekistan named Nazimuddin. They were still seeking his body. Also Thursday, a Pakistani military spokesman in the Swat Valley said Sher Muhammad Qasab, a wanted Taliban leader, had been arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Qasab's surname means ''butcher,'' and the spokesman said his notoriety derived from his practice of beheading security officers and civilians opposed to the Taliban. Residents of Swat reached by telephone said that Mr. Qasab had been a butcher in civilian life, then took his new surname on joining the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Qasab's arrest came during a military search operation in the Charbagh area of Swat, the troubled area northwest of the capital where the Pakistani military has largely put down an insurgency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His capture follows the recent arrest of Muslim Khan, the Taliban spokesman in Swat, and a less senior Taliban commander, Mahmood Khan. All three men are known to be close associates of Maulvi Fazlullah, the Taliban chief in the region whose whereabouts remain unknown, military officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier this week, three of Mr. Qasab's sons were killed in fighting with security forces, officials said. When he was captured, along with another son and more than a dozen other militants, Mr. Qasab was wounded, the military spokesman said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Eight years after 9/11, the specter of terrorism still haunts the United States. Just last week, F.B.I. agents were working double time to unravel the alarming case of a Denver airport shuttle driver accused of training with explosives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and buying bomb-making chemicals. In Dallas, a young Jordanian was charged with trying to blow up a skyscraper; in Springfield, Ill., a prison parolee was arrested for trying to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the local federal building. Meanwhile, the Obama administration struggled to decide whether sending many more troops to Afghanistan would be the best way to forestall a future </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But important as they were, those news reports masked a surprising and perhaps heartening long-term trend: Many students of terrorism believe that in important ways, Al Qaeda and its ideology of global jihad are in a pronounced decline -- with its central leadership thrown off balance as operatives are increasingly picked off by missiles and manhunts and, more important, with its tactics discredited in public opinion across the Muslim world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Al Qaeda is losing its moral argument about the killing of innocent civilians,'' said Emile A. Nakhleh, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency's strategic analysis program on political Islam until 2006. ''They're finding it harder to recruit. They're finding it harder to raise money.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marc Sageman, a former C.I.A. officer and forensic psychiatrist, counted 10 serious plots with Western targets, successful and unsuccessful, that could be linked to Al Qaeda or its allies in 2004, a peak he believes was motivated by the American-led invasion of Iraq the year before. In 2008, he said, there were just three. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Sageman has been in the forefront of those who argue that the centrally led Al Qaeda responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is giving way to a generation of dispersed, aspiring terrorists linked largely by the Internet -- who still pose a danger, but of a lesser degree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I said two years ago it was a diminishing problem, and everything I've seen since then has confirmed it,'' Dr. Sageman said of what counterterrorism specialists call Al Qaeda Central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Sageman is not alone in that assessment. Audrey Kurth Cronin, a professor at the National War College in Washington, cites the arcs of previous violent extremist groups, from the Russian People's Will to the Irish Republican Army, that she studied for her new book, ''How Terrorism Ends.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think Al Qaeda is in the process of imploding,'' she said. ''This is not necessarily the end. But the trends are in a good direction.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the question of how much comfort to take from such an assessment, and whether it should change American counterterrorism policy, remain wide open, as shown by the Afghanistan debate and the charges against the Denver man, Najibullah Zazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even counterterrorism officials who agree that Al Qaeda is on the wane, for example, say the organization might well regroup if left unmolested in a lawless region in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Afghanistan or Somalia. Moreover, they point out that even a lone terrorist with modest skills can produce mass carnage. Six years before 9/11, with no aid from a sophisticated network, Timothy McVeigh used a simple fertilizer bomb in Oklahoma City to kill 168 people. And the 2001 calamity was the work of, at most, a few dozen plotters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nevertheless, some government officials do take quiet, if wary, satisfaction in two developments that they say underlie the broad belief that Al Qaeda is on a downhill slope. One is the success of military Special Operations units, the C.I.A. and allies in killing prominent terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three days apart in mid-September, American special forces in Somalia firing from helicopters killed Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a leader of a Somalian organization, Al Shabab, which is allied with Al Qaeda, and the police in Indonesia killed the most-wanted terrorist in Southeast Asia, Noordin Muhammad Top, in an assault on a house in Java.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft have taken a steady toll on Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies since the Bush administration accelerated these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, a policy reinforced by President Obama. A count of such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> compiled by the Center for American Progress in Washington, found a handful in 2006 and 2007, rising rapidly to 36 in 2008, and another 36 so far in 2009, nearly all in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to thinning the ranks of potential plotters, the constant threat of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the air makes it far harder for terrorists to move, communicate, and plan, counterterrorism officials say. And while the officials say they worry about a public backlash in response to the civilians killed during the air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> those officials also say the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be frightening away potential recruits for terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second trend is older and probably more critical. The celebration in many Muslim countries that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has given way to broad disillusionment with mass killing and the ideology behind it, according to a number of polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Between 2002 and 2009, the view that suicide bombings are ''often or sometimes justified'' has declined, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, from 43 percent to 12 percent in Jordan; from 26 percent to 13 percent in Indonesia; and from 33 percent to 5 percent in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (excluding some sparsely populated, embattled areas). Positive ratings for Osama bin Laden have fallen by half or more in most of the countries Pew polled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Peter Mandaville, a professor of government and Islamic studies at George Mason University, says a series of public recantations'' by prominent Islamist scholars and militants in recent years have had an effect. But the biggest catalyst has been bombings close to home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Right after 9/11, people thought, wow, America is not invincible,'' Mr. Mandaville said. ''It was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the U.S., and they were for it.'' But when large numbers of innocent Muslims fell victim to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''it became more and more difficult to romanticize Al Qaeda as fighting the global hegemons -- basically, 'sticking it to the man.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Support for bombings plummeted in Jordan, for example, after three bombs hit hotels in Amman in November 2005, including one at a wedding party. In Iraq, the slaughter of civilians by the group that called itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia prompted Sunni tribal leaders to make common cause with American forces. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, proliferating bombings, including the 2007 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that killed Benazir Bhutto, soured most people of all social classes on Qaeda-style violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Al Qaeda, for all its talk of global religious war, offered no practical solutions for local problems: unemployment, poverty, official corruption and poor education. ''People realized bin Laden didn't have anything to offer,'' Dr. Mandaville said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Weighing the importance of such statistics is tricky, however. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University who is often consulted by government agencies, is a dissenter from what he acknowledged has become a majority view among counterterrorism specialists about the decline of Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the sinking poll numbers, Mr. Hoffman said, ''Al Qaeda's core demographic is young hotheads aged 16 to 28, and I still don't think it's lost its appeal to that demographic.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said many terrorist groups kill their compatriots and become unpopular, but still remain in business. ''Terrorism ends, sure,'' he said. ''But with Al Qaeda it may be 50 years, and we're only eight years away from 9/11.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even those who are convinced Al Qaeda is growing weaker offer a cautious prognosis about what that might mean. They say that what is growing less likely is an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil with a toll equal to or greater than that of 9/11. But they concede that the example of Al Qaeda will continue to produce copycats: ''Bin Laden has given others a narrative, a grand story of struggle, and he's given them tactics as well,'' Dr. Mandaville said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Sageman said the United States should approach the threat not with hysteria, but with a careful analysis of the motives and patterns of people drawn into violent plotting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Terrorism,'' he added, ''is here to stay.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The news last week made that crystal clear, but it also made clear a corresponding reality: counterterrorism, too, is here to stay, and is achieving some successes. Al Qaeda has no entirely safe haven today, and the Afghanistan debate is over how to keep it that way. And if the arrest of Mr. Zazi sent a shudder through many Americans, it's worth remembering that it came before any bombs went off.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, vice president and an array of cabinet secretaries, intelligence chiefs, generals, diplomats and advisers gathered in a windowless basement room of the White House for three hours on Wednesday to chart a new course in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The one thing everyone could agree on: None of the choices is easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just six months after President Obama adopted what he called a ''stronger, smarter and comprehensive strategy'' for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he is back at the same table starting from scratch. The choices available to him are both disparate and not particularly palatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He could stick with his March strategy, but his commander wants as many as 40,000 more troops to make it work. He could go radically in the other direction and embrace Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s idea of using fewer troops, focused more on hunting down leaders of Al Qaeda, but risk the collapse of the Afghan government. Or he could search for some middle-ground option that avoids the risks of the other two, but potentially find himself in a quagmire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's doing what he has to do: before you make a decision, you better scrub all your alternative options,'' said Brett H. McGurk, who worked on Afghanistan and Iraq at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and briefly under Mr. Obama. ''I just suspect they'll find, like we found with Iraq, that it's two imperfect choices.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of the decision is defining America's strategic interest in the region. Mr. Obama has called Afghanistan a ''war of necessity'' to stop it from becoming a haven again for Al Qaeda to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America. The question is, how much danger is there and how many lives can be lost and dollars spent to minimize it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stephen Biddle, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who has advised Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, said the chances of a new Qaeda stronghold that could threaten American territory was relatively low but that even a small risk was a concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's like buying life insurance for a 50-year-old,'' Mr. Biddle said. ''The odds of a 50-year-old dying in the next year in America are substantially less than 1 percent. And yet most Americans buy life insurance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meeting  on Wednesday was one of five planned  as the president rethinks his approach in response to a dire report by General McChrystal. The session was meant to review the worsening political and security situation, while future meetings will examine options in detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal's preferred option builds on the strategy outlined by Mr. Obama in March with a substantial infusion of new troops. The counterinsurgency strategy emphasized protecting civilians over just engaging insurgents, restricting airstrikes to reduce civilian casualties and sharply expanding the Afghan security forces through accelerated training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most counterinsurgency specialists say a larger ground force is needed to clear Taliban-held territory and hold it while instructors train enough competent Afghan soldiers and police officers, and Afghan leaders build an effective government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Without more troops, the insurgents can continue to maneuver around us and set I.E.D.'s, which kill our people,'' said Peter Gilchrist,  a retired British major general and a former senior commander in Afghanistan, referring to improvised explosive devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's no question that more forces will buy more space and time, and that will translate into an effort to get more Afghan police into the hinterlands and more Afghan National Army soldiers through training,'' said Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the NATO  commander in Afghanistan until June 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Critics argue that foreign forces have never pacified Afghanistan and that more troops will only increase the perception of them being occupiers. The result would be a long, drawn-out war with many more American casualties. They say that though the Taliban are ruthless, they do not pose a danger to America, while Al Qaeda, which is a threat, is located primarily in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, widespread allegations of fraud in Afghanistan's presidential election have left the country's leadership uncertain and underscored that America does not have a partner in Kabul with broad public legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the other end of the spectrum is Mr. Biden's approach. Rather than try to protect the Afghan population from the Taliban, American forces would concentrate on eliminating the Qaeda leadership, primarily in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, using Special Operations forces, Predator missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other surgical tactics. The Americans would also accelerate training of Afghan forces and provide support as they took the lead against the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This counterterrorism strategy, as opposed to a counterinsurgency strategy, is predicated on the theory that the real threat to American national security lies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, not Afghanistan. Some call this proposal the ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First'' option. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the critical focus, the greatest security risk for the United States,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. ''And all of this exercise, after all, is about our security.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials lately have been pointing to what they call great success in working with Pakistani authorities to decapitate Al Qaeda and other extremist cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet critics note that successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> require good intelligence on the ground, something that may be lost without enough forces. After Mr. Bush sent more troops to Iraq in early 2007, tips about enemy locations soared, a development some attributed to a larger American presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, a greater reliance on air power could mean more civilian deaths, making enemies of the very people American commanders are trying to sway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In between those two approaches is a menu of options not especially satisfying to either side of the debate.  Mr. Biddle estimates there are about a half-dozen variants in this territory, from negotiating a power-sharing arrangement with the Taliban to paying off local warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of these options envision roughly the same number of troops as are in the country now or a smaller increase than General McChrystal's maximum request. With the reinforcements Mr. Obama ordered earlier this year, the United States will have 68,000 troops on the ground this fall. The Pentagon still has a request for another 10,000 that was deferred last spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Substantially expanding Afghan security forces would be critical. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, has said that by 2012 the Afghan Army should be increased to 240,000 troops from 92,000 and police forces to 160,000 officers from 84,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal's troop request, said one administration official, offers alternatives requiring fewer than 40,000 more troops. If the goal is recalibrated to secure Afghan cities but not the countryside, then not as many more troops would be needed. And if the goal is scaled back even further, then the additional 10,000 troops previously requested could be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These ideas, though, may not be big enough to change the trajectory of an effort that has muddled along for eight years. Critics on both sides said the worst of all options would be some version of staying the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The middle options,'' Mr. McGurk said, ''are either high risk or they're status quo or they're unworkable.''</SPAN></P>

Allied troops focus on security in Kabul. *Includes infantry, cavalry and armor units that take part in offensive operations. The insurgency starts to gain strength, and American forces grow. There are fewer Special Operations forces because of the war in Iraq. American units operate separately from NATO ones. American forces continue to hunt for pockets of the Taliban in the south and east. NATO reconstruction operations expand into the west. NATO expands into the south and takes command of American forces in the east. Dutch, Canadian and British units move into the south. The troops encounter heavy resistance as the insurgency gains strength. Violence escalates as the insurgency grows. In response, NATO commits more resources and expands forces, especially in the south. American units remain in the east, where the fighting is intense. The Taliban gain control of more of the south even as more NATO and American troops are deployed there. British forces in the south are five times as large as in 2006, and the fighting is more severe. Americans plan a surge in troops. American troop levels climb as new brigades deploy in the south. Some of them reinforce British units, who have begun to penetrate insurgent havens in Helmand. Others focus on training and advising Afghan forces as violence continues to rise in the south and east.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the arrival of the Obama administration and the prospect of substantially increased aid, more Pakistanis -- an overwhelming majority -- continued to reject the United States as a partner to fight militancy in their country, a new poll finds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey, conducted by the Washington-based International Republican Institute, underscored the difficulties the Obama administration faced in its efforts to tamp down Islamic militancy in this strategically vital nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The I.R.I. is a nonprofit pro-democracy group which is financed by the American government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of the slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and a relatively inexperienced politician, scored a 25 percent approval rating how he's handling his job, 6 points more than in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His chief opponent, Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim League-N, garnered a 67 percent favorable rating, down from 75 percent in March.The findings come as Washington is poised to spend $1.5 billion in assistance for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the coming year, a big jump in American funds intended to help strengthen the civilian government rather than the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The poll confirms the persistent strand of anti-American discourse in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the last few years, and its release coincides with particularly strong </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Pakistani media about the American Embassy's hiring private security firms to protect American diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as the Obama administration takes pride in the new funds for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the increased aid has been criticized in the Pakistani news media and among politicians as too little, one calling it ''peanuts.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Face-to-face interviews were conducted July 15 to Aug. 7 with 4,900 adults throughout </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> four provinces, excluding areas in the North-West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus one percentage point. The survey results will be available on the institute's Web site, www.iri.org, on Friday. The I.R.I. has conducted surveys in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A troubling aspect of the findings for the Obama administration, analysts said, was the significant increase in the rejection of the United States as a partner in the war against Islamic militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the poll, 80 percent of the respondents said they were opposed to United States assistance in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fight against terrorism, a 19 percentage-point increase since the last survey conducted by the institute in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The survey says that 76 percent of the respondents were opposed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partnering with the United States on missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against extremists by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft. Such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been under way for several years against militants from Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the tribal areas, and have recently intensified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American missile from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban in August, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that was assisted by Pakistani intelligence, officials said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were various reasons for the harsh attitude toward the United States, even as the Obama administration tried to reach out to Muslim nations, said Kamran Khan, a prominent journalist and the anchor of the most widely watched television news show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Most Pakistanis are exposed to the popular media and to extremist clerics who provide this perception,'' Mr. Khan said. ''The American side of the story is not available to the people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq colored Pakistani views of the United States, Mr. Khan said. ''The United States is seen as an occupying force and moving unilaterally against Muslim nations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Obama was perceived as more ''trustworthy and plain speaking,'' Mr. Khan said these attributes were not enough to outweigh the hostility to American policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In order to improve American standing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the special envoy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, had ordered an overhaul of the public diplomacy programs and was sending several seasoned diplomats to bolster the embassy, a senior American official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A public affairs strategy centered on the American desire for a strong relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and focused on describing the common enemy as Al Qaeda and the Taliban was about to begin, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new effort included spending about $30 million on educational and cultural exchanges between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, and providing more Fulbright scholarships for Pakistanis to study at American universities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For three months, the military has been drawing up plans, holding in-depth deliberations and studying past operations in the area, where previous campaigns ended in failure and resulted in some of the military's highest levels of casualties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He and other officials did not want to be identified while discussing confidential preparations for the campaign. But they said the military now seemed ready to try to re-enter the area, having decided it could wait no longer. ''If we don't take the battle to them, they will bring the battle to us,'' the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The past two operations in South Waziristan ended up with the military bogged down and suing for peace, resulting in a series of accords that ultimately strengthened the hand of the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An operation in January 2004 led to a peace agreement by that April, followed by another on Feb. 5, 2005, with Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. But with few if any enforcement mechanisms, the accords were never sturdy and allowed the militants to regroup and tighten their hold on the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In late January 2008, the military began another operation, called Zalzala, or Earthquake, with the declared goal of dislodging Mr. Mehsud. The operation did not cause even a tremor, and only 12 days later, authorities were struggling to revive the peace accord. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the failure of the operation went any pretense of state authority in Waziristan, as the government in effect ceded control to emboldened militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials hope that things will be different this time, having now taken on militants' strongholds, each in their turn, in recent years in other areas: first in Bajaur, then in Mohmand and, most recently, in the Swat Valley. Perhaps most critical was the elimination of Mr. Mehsud, whose death in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August helped fracture the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban. ''The Tehrik-i-Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a monolithic organization remains no more,'' a security official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since June, Waziristan has been under an economic blockade, with thousands of army soldiers sitting on the fringes of the area, waiting for orders from the military high command to move in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some argue that the military should have mounted an operation immediately after Mr. Mehsud's death. ''As far as we are concerned, the operation should have been launched three months ago,'' said a senior government official. ''Baitullah is dead and his group seems to be in some form of disarray. And this provides the best opportunity to go after them.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a senior military official said that, in addition to needing to wait for the forces and resources to be available, the military wanted to see what would be the repercussions of Mr. Mehsud's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We thought that Baitullah's death would unravel the Mehsud militant group and galvanize the tribe to stand up to the people they have suffered from,'' the official said. ''It didn't happen.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now there is a sense within the military establishment that the situation in South Waziristan cannot be allowed to be perpetuated. The blockade is nearly three months old, and the military, which has been conducting limited airstrikes, is running out of targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, described Waziristan as an intelligence black hole. ''We have to move in,'' he said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A large number of civilians have already relocated to Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, both in North-West Frontier Province, giving the army a relatively free hand to mount an operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But all agree that the battle ahead is formidable. Questions remain whether the army will be able to hold territory and sustain operations in a tough and treacherous terrain, where snows arrive in late November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Mehsud militants not only have the advantage of familiarity with the area, but their numbers -- estimated at 6,000 to 7,000 -- have been thickened by foreign elements, in particular Uzbeks, who have a reputation as ferocious fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is the Haqqani network, which uses the area as a base for its operations in Afghanistan, and there is Al Qaeda, which depends heavily on the Mehsud fighting force. ''They will defend their power base and fight till the very last,'' one officer said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steps by the United States to vastly expand its aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as the footprint of its embassy and private security contractors here, are aggravating an already volatile anti-American mood as Washington pushes for greater action by the government against the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An aid package of $1.5 billion a year for the next five years passed by Congress last week asks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cease supporting terrorist groups on its soil and to ensure that the military does not interfere with civilian politics. President Asif Ali Zardari, whose association with the United States has added to his unpopularity, agreed to the stipulations in the aid package. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many here, especially in the powerful army, object to the conditions as interference in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> internal affairs, and they are interpreting the larger American footprint in more sinister ways. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials say the embassy and its security presence must expand in order to monitor how the new money is spent. They also have real security concerns, which were underscored Monday when a suicide bomber, dressed in the uniform of a Pakistani security force, killed five people at a United Nations office in the heart of Islamabad, the capital.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States Embassy has publicized plans for a vast new building in Islamabad for about 1,000 people, with security for some diplomats provided through a Washington-based private contracting company, DynCorp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The embassy setup, with American demands for importing more armored vehicles, is a significant expansion over the last 15 years. It comes at a time of intense discussion in Washington over whether to widen American operations and aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a base for Al Qaeda -- as an alternative to deeper American involvement in Afghanistan with the addition of more forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fierce opposition here is revealing deep strains in the alliance. Even at its current levels, the American presence was fueling a sense of occupation among Pakistani politicians and security officials, said several Pakistani officials, who did not want to be named for fear of antagonizing the United States. The United States was now seen as behaving in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> much as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In particular, the Pakistani military and the intelligence agencies are concerned that DynCorp is being used by Washington to develop a parallel network of security and intelligence personnel within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, officials and politicians close to the army said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The concerns are serious enough that last month a local company hired by DynCorp to provide Pakistani men to be trained as security guards for American diplomats was raided by the Islamabad police. The owner of the company, the Inter-Risk Security Company, Capt. Syed Ali Ja Zaidi, was later arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The action against Inter-Risk, apparently intended to cripple the DynCorp program, was taken on orders from the senior levels of the Pakistani government, said an official familiar with the raid, who was not authorized to speak on the record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The entire workings of DynCorp within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are now under review by the Pakistani government, said a senior government official directly involved with the Americans, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tensions are erupting as the United States is pressing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to take on not only those Taliban groups that have threatened the government, but also the Taliban leadership that uses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a base to organize and conduct their insurgency against American forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a public statement, the American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, suggested last week that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should eliminate the Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, a onetime ally of the Pakistanis who Washington says is now based in Baluchistan, a province on the Afghanistan border. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not get rid of Mullah Omar, the United States would, she suggested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reinforcing the ambassador, the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, said Sunday that the United States regarded tackling Qaeda sanctuaries in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as ''the next step'' in the conflict in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in an unusually stern reaction last week,  said that missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baluchistan, as implied by the Americans, ''would not be allowed.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistanis also complain that they are not being sufficiently consulted over the pending White House decision on whether to send more troops to Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The head of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI,  Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with senior officials at the Central Intelligence Agency last week in Washington, where he argued against sending more troops to Afghanistan, a Pakistani official familiar with the visit said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army, riding high after its campaign to wrench back control of the Swat Valley from the Taliban, remains nervous about Washington's intentions and the push against the new aid is reflective of that anxiety, Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the Zardari government is trumpeting the new aid as a triumph, officials say the language in the legislation ignores long-held prerogatives about Pakistani sovereignty, making the $1.5 billion a tough sell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Now everyone has a handle they can use to rip into the Zardari government,'' said a senior Pakistani official involved in the American-Pakistani dialogue but who declined to be named because he did not want to inflame the discussion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The expanding American security presence has become another club. DynCorp has attracted particular scrutiny after the Pakistani news media reported that Blackwater, the contractor that has generated controversy because of its aggressive tactics in Iraq, was also in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently, there have been a series of complaints by Islamabad residents who said they had been ''roughed up'' by hefty, plainclothes American men bearing weapons, presumably from DynCorp, one of the senior Pakistani officials involved with the Americans said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Office had sent two formal diplomatic complaints in the past few weeks to the American Embassy about such episodes, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The embassy had received complaints, and confirmed two instances, an embassy official said, but the embassy denied receiving any formal protests from the Foreign Office. It also declined to comment about the presence of Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have said that Blackwater employees worked at a remote base in Shamsi, in Baluchistan, where they loaded missiles and bombs onto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliban and Qaeda militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Shamsi had been shifted by the Americans to Afghanistan this year, a senior Pakistani military official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several Blackwater employees also worked in the North-West Frontier Province supervising the construction of a training center for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frontier Corps, a Pakistani official from the region said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was considerable unease about the American diplomatic presence in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province, one of the senior government officials said. Politicians were asking why the United States needed a consulate in Peshawar, which borders the tribal areas, when that office did not issue visas, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another question, he said, was why did the consulate plan to buy the biggest, and most modern building in the city, the Pearl Continental hotel -- which was bombed in a terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year -- as its new headquarters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Parliament prepared to discuss the American aid package Wednesday, the tone of the debate was expected to be scathing. On a television talk show, Senator Tariq Aziz, a member of the opposition party, called the legislation ''the charter for new colonization.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People think this government has sold us to the Americans again for their own selfish interests,'' said Jahangir Tareen, a former cabinet minister and a member of Parliament, in an interview. ''Some people think the United States is out to get </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to defang </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to destroy the army as it exists so it can't fight India and to break down the ISI's ability to influence events in India and Afghanistan. Everyone is saying about the Americans, 'Told you so.' ''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide bomber dressed in the uniform of one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces struck the United NationsWorld Food Program offices in Islamabad on Monday, killing  five people in what the police said was a serious breach in a building tightly guarded by private security officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The interior minister, A. Rehman Malik, said that the bomber asked for permission to use the bathroom, entered the building and detonated about 16 pounds of explosives in the lobby just after noon, when the compound was filled with people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber wore a uniform from the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary unit assigned to guard diplomatic missions in the area, raising questions of whether he had assistance from others working inside the compound. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bombing was the first direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a United Nations agency here in the Pakistani capital, and the organization immediately closed its offices in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a temporary arrangement to ensure the safety and security of our staff,'' Ishrat Rizvi, the spokeswoman for United Nations operations in Islamabad, said by telephone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A prominent international presence here, the World Food Program provides food aid to as many as 10 million people across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has been essential in tending to Pakistanis displaced by the military's operations against Taliban militants in tribal areas and the Swat Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the explosion came as the Pakistani Army was planning a full-scale offensive in another tribal area, South Waziristan, the prime Taliban stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a surprise to Pakistani intelligence officials, the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, met Sunday with a small group of reporters and vowed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Pakistani and American targets would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the reporters, Anwar Mehsud, who works with a Pakistani television channel,  Aaj TV, said Monday that the Pakistani Taliban leader had invited the group to dispel reports that he had been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as late as Monday, one Pakistani intelligence official said he had been told  that Hakimullah Mehsud was confirmed dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initial reports said  Hakimullah Mehsud had been killed in the fight over who would succeed Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader  killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More recently, Pakistani intelligence officials reported that Hakimullah Mehsud had been killed in a helicopter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the television reporter, Hakimullah Mehsud also used his news conference to dispel any notion of a split in the Pakistani Taliban since Baitullah Mehsud's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He appeared with his top lieutenants in a show of unity: Waliur Rehman, the head of the Taliban in South Waziristan; Qari Hussain, the organizer of the Taliban's suicide bomb squad; and Azam Tariq, the new spokesman for the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reporters from Islamabad were also invited, but declined to go because of security concerns -- something the bombing in Islamabad underscored. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A string of successful operations recently killing or capturing high-level figures from Al Qaeda, particularly in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has fueled the argument inside the Obama administration about the necessity of a substantial troop buildup in Afghanistan, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration  officials said the United States had eliminated more than half of its top targets over the last year, severely constricted Al Qaeda's capacity to operate and choked off a lot of its financing. The sense of progress against Al Qaeda and its allies has helped shape the internal debate over the best way to fight in Afghanistan as President Obama explores alternatives to a large escalation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House has begun promoting the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and raids that have killed Qaeda operatives in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Somalia and elsewhere. Mr. Obama will visit the National Counterterrorism Center on Tuesday to call attention to the operations. While aides said the public focus was not related to the Afghanistan review, it could give Mr. Obama political room if he rejected or pared back the request for 40,000 more troops from Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The focus on so-called surgical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against terrorism suspects comes as the Afghanistan review accelerates. Mr. Obama met Monday with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates; his national security team met separately. The president will host Congressional leaders  on Tuesday to talk about Afghanistan, then meet with top advisers on Wednesday and Friday to consider a new strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The internal debate has spilled out in public at times and created stress within the Obama team. Mr. Gates warned his colleagues in a speech Monday to keep their advice to the president private, a statement taken as a rebuke to General McChrystal, who last week said publicly that he did not think a smaller-scale option would work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is imperative that all of us taking part in these deliberations, civilians and military alike, provide our best advice to the president candidly but privately,'' Mr. Gates told the Association of the United States Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just a day earlier Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, also appeared to chide General McChrystal for his public comments. But Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said Mr. Gates's comment was directed not just at the general but at all participants in the review. ''To interpret this as being directed at only one person is really missing the point,'' Mr. Morrell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House also tried to make it clear on Monday that Mr. Obama did not envision actually pulling out of Afghanistan no matter how he rules on General McChrystal's request. ''I don't think we have the option to leave,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even the option advocated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for a scaled-back approach would not reduce the current force of 68,000 troops, officials said. Instead, it would keep troop levels roughly where they are now but shift emphasis to the sort of Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Special Forces operations that have been used more aggressively over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That idea has its critics, including General McChrystal and other officials who do not overlook the value of such operations -- indeed, General McChrystal used to head the Joint Special Operations Command, which was responsible for many of those operations. But they say they depend on a significant troop presence on the ground to provide intelligence and restrict the space where Al Qaeda can operate. They argue that defeating Al Qaeda requires fighting the Taliban, too, and warn of the difficulties in managing the relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which has often bristled at American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday evening, Mr. Gates suggested that a shortage of troops had contributed to the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. ''The reality is that because of our inability -- and the inability, frankly, of our allies -- to put enough troops into Afghanistan, the Taliban do have the momentum right now,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials trace what they see as increasing success at killing individual Qaeda leaders to the stepped-up use of Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the brutal and largely ungoverned border regions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. President George W. Bush approved a more aggressive campaign of surgical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year before leaving office, and Mr. Obama has embraced and expanded the program. The Obama team has also worked to strengthen its partnership with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of the 20 Qaeda or allied leaders most wanted by the United States in the Pakistani tribal areas, 11 have been killed or captured since July 2008, according to senior administration officials who provided a briefing on the operations on condition of anonymity. Another four  added to the top-20 list have also been killed or captured, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much this all adds up to is hard to say. The Bush administration regularly cited its successes in eliminating high-level Qaeda figures, too, and yet the organization seemed to replenish itself. The Obama administration appears no closer than its predecessor to capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri or the Afghan Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But one official who has been involved in the struggle with terrorism under both administrations said Al Qaeda had been significantly degraded. Fewer than 100 Qaeda fighters are left in Afghanistan, according to American estimates, and many foreigners who fought with Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have begun leaving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, last month's arrest of Najibullah Zazi, an American alleged to have been trained in a Qaeda camp in preparation for a possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States, showed that Al Qaeda appeared still to be working to hit American targets even here. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistani interior minister said Tuesday that the government was expecting more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Taliban as the military prepared to launch a major offensive in South Waziristan, the rugged northwestern tribal region considered a stronghold of Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The minister, Rehman Malik, said  the Taliban had  orchestrated the suicide bombing of the headquarters of the World Food Program in Islamabad on Monday, which a Taliban spokesman confirmed. The blast killed five people -- four Pakistanis and an Iraqi -- and led the United Nations to shutter its offices in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban spokesman, Azam Tariq, made the confirmation  in a phone conversation with The Associated Press. ''We proudly claim the responsibility for the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the U.N. office in Islamabad,'' he told The A.P. ''We will send more bombers for such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' he said, adding that the Taliban would not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim relief groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking to reporters at an Islamabad hospital while visiting some of the people who were wounded in the bombing, Mr. Malik said Taliban militants in the northern valley of Swat had waited until after the Muslim holiday of Id al-Fitr to launch their assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also said Taliban leaders in Waziristan had recently gathered to plan their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to avenge the death of their leader, Baitullah Mehsud, who was killed in August in a United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik also cast doubt over a new video that purports to show Hakimullah Mehsud, the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban. He said the person in the video instead appears to be Hakimullah's brother, who bears a strong resemblance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani government and intelligence officials believe Mr. Mehsud, a young and brash insurgent commander, died in a power struggle among rival militant chiefs after Baitullah Mehsud, was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence officers were surprised to learn of the video, which was made during an interview that Hakimullah Mehsud -- if that is who it was -- apparently gave on Sunday to a small group of reporters. One of the reporters, Anwar Mehsud, who works with a Pakistani television channel,  Aaj TV, said Monday that Mr. Mehsud had invited the group to dispel the reports that he had been killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as late as Monday, however, one Pakistani intelligence official said he had been told  that Mr. Mehsud was confirmed dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the television reporter, Mr. Mehsud also used the interview session to dispel any notion of a split within the Pakistani Taliban. He appeared with his top lieutenants in a show of unity: Waliur Rehman, the head of the Taliban in South Waziristan; Qari Hussain, the organizer of the Taliban's suicide bombing squads; and Azam Tariq, the new spokesman for the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reporters from Islamabad were also invited, but they declined to go because of security concerns -- something the bombing at the World Food Progam in Islamabad underscored. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik said the bomber was dressed in the uniform of the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary unit assigned to guard diplomatic missions in the area, raising questions of whether he had assistance from others working inside the compound. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Malik also said that the bomber asked for permission to use the bathroom, entered the building and detonated about 16 pounds of explosives in the lobby just after noon, when the compound was filled with people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was especially worrisome because it occurred at the heavily fortified United Nations compound that was tightly guarded by private security officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About 80 people work at the compound, a three-story building in an upscale residential neighborhood. The building is also equipped with video surveillance cameras, motion detectors and explosives-detection devices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The street was barricaded at both ends, and vehicles and visitors were supposed to be allowed entry only after a thorough security check. The outer walls of the building were secured by barbed wire, and a paramilitary post was located within walking distance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the first direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a United Nations agency here in the Pakistani capital, and the organization's officials quickly moved to close their offices in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a temporary arrangement to ensure the safety and security of our staff,'' Ishrat Rizvi, the spokeswoman for United Nations operations in Islamabad, said by telephone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A prominent international presence here, the World Food Program says it provides food aid to as many as 10 million people across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including many of those displaced by the military's operations against Taliban militants in tribal areas and the Swat Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in a statement from Geneva, called the bombing a ''heinous crime committed against those who have been working tirelessly to assist the poor and the vulnerable on the frontlines of hunger and other human suffering in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama told Congressional leaders on Tuesday that he would not substantially reduce American forces in Afghanistan or shift the mission to just hunting terrorists there, but he indicated that he remained undecided about the major troop buildup proposed by his commanding general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meeting with leaders from both parties at the White House, Mr. Obama seemed to be searching for some sort of middle ground, saying he wanted to ''dispense with the straw man argument that this is about either doubling down or leaving Afghanistan,'' as White House officials later described his remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the war approached its eight-year anniversary on Wednesday, the session underscored the perilous crosscurrents awaiting Mr. Obama. While some Democrats said they would support whatever he decided, others challenged him about sending more troops. And Republicans pressed him to order the escalation without delay, leading to a pointed exchange between the president and Senator John McCain of Arizona, his Republican opponent from last year's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McCain told the president that ''time is not on our side.'' He added, ''This should not be a leisurely process,'' according to several people in the room.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few minutes later, Mr. Obama replied, ''John, I can assure you this won't be leisurely,'' according to several attendees. ''No one feels more urgency to get this right than I do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, compared with the harsh debate over health care, the tone was civil and restrained during the 75-minute meeting in the State Dining Room as Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and about 30 members of Congress gathered around a large table with only glasses of water and notebooks in front of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama summoned the lawmakers to assure them that he would keep their concerns in mind as he considered the request of his commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, for as many as 40,000 more troops. The president plans to meet with his national security team on Wednesday to talk about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and on Friday to talk about Afghanistan. Aides plan to schedule one more meeting before he decides on General McChrystal's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several administration officials and lawmakers who attended the session on Tuesday said Mr. Obama was intent on using it to dismiss any impression that he would consider pulling out of Afghanistan. ''There is no option that would entail a dramatic reduction in troops,'' said one administration official, who, like others quoted in this article, requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden made it clear that the option Mr. Biden had proposed was not a pure counterterrorism alternative, relying only on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Special Forces to track down leaders of Al Qaeda. Instead, Mr. Biden's approach would increase the use of such surgical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while leaving the overall size of the American force in Afghanistan roughly at the 68,000 troops currently authorized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in the final moments of the meeting, Mr. Obama sought to put to rest suspicions of friction with General McChrystal. ''I'm the one who hired him,'' Mr. Obama said, according to participants. ''I put him there to give me a frank assessment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A joint appearance afterward on the White House driveway by the two top Democratic Congressional leaders demonstrated Mr. Obama's political challenge. ''The one thing that I thought was interesting was that everyone, Democrats and Republicans, said whatever decision you make, we'll support it basically,'' said Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, smiled and raised her eyebrows in apparent disagreement. ''Whether we agreed with it or voted for it remains to be seen when we see what the president puts forth,'' she said. ''But I think there was a real display of universal respect for the manner in which he was approaching it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least three Democrats -- Ms. Pelosi; Senator Carl Levin, the Armed Services Committee chairman; and Representative David R. Obey, the Appropriations Committee chairman -- voiced reservations during the meeting about increasing troops, according to those in attendance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were a number of people who spoke out with a lot of caution about getting in deeper and what the endpoint is,'' Mr. Levin said in an interview. Mr. Levin, who promoted accelerated training of Afghan forces, then met alone with Mr. Obama  to expand on his views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others shared their skepticism in interviews. ''Clearly, there is hesitancy about the prospect of sending 40,000 more troops,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said after the meeting that ''it would be irresponsible'' to send more troops until it became clear ''what is possible in Afghanistan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Democrats were more supportive of General McChrystal's request, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, head of the  intelligence committee, and Representative Ike Skelton, head of the  Armed Services Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I said the real war in Afghanistan did not start until March, when the president made the speech on strategy,'' Mr. Skelton said in an interview, referring to the strategy Mr. Obama put in place shortly after taking office. ''There was no strategy before that,'' he said, and so the president ought to give General McChrystal what he needs to execute it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans pressed even harder. After the meeting, Mr. McCain warned against any middle ground. ''Half measures is what I worry about,'' he said. Citing the Bush administration's experience in Iraq, he added that half measures ''lead to failure over time and an erosion of American public support.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama separately pointed to American successes against Al Qaeda in a series of recent missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Special Forces raids. During a visit to the National Counterterrorism Center just outside Washington on Tuesday, he said Al Qaeda had ''lost operational capacity'' but he vowed to continue pressing the battle to cripple the network around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White House officials said the president's visit was not related to the Afghanistan review. But the public focus on efforts to eliminate Al Qaeda's top hierarchy through surgical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could provide political cover for Mr. Obama should he reject the most expansive request for 40,000 more troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, told a military conference on Tuesday that the president's strategy review was progressing toward a decision. ''It is moving quite rapidly,'' he told the Association of the United States Army. ''There is a recognition of the need to move through this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The general said the effort in Afghanistan required ''a sustained, substantial commitment,'' but he declined to say if that meant more troops.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unusual move, the Pakistani Army expressed public anger Wednesday at the terms of a large American aid package, saying it interfered with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national security, a posture that set the military at loggerheads with the American-backed civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The criticism made in a statement after the monthly meeting of the nation's top generals embarrassed the government of President Asif Ali Zardari and came as the Obama administration is seeking to persuade the Pakistani Army to broaden its campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was so offended by stipulations in the American legislation that he complained to the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, when the two men met in Islamabad on Tuesday, according to a senior Pakistani military officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The legislation passed by Congress last week gives </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $1.5 billion over the next year for the Zardari government to build roads, schools and other infrastructure, a gesture intended to shore up the weak civilian government and turn around the widespread antipathy toward the United States among Pakistanis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the aid package has served to widen the distrust between the  military and the civilian government, even though the new aid comes in addition to America's aid to the Pakistani military, which had totaled more than $10 billion since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The section of the legislation that has outraged the army says the secretary of state must report to Congress every six months on whether the government is exercising ''effective civilian control over the military.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The secretary must assess the extent to which the civilian government has oversight over the military chain of command, promotion of generals and the military budgets, provisions that even Pakistani politicians have taken strong exception to as meddling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The legislation also says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must show progress in ending  support for terrorist groups, and dismantle groups operating out of Quetta and Muridke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The generals were specifically infuriated by mention of Quetta, which the Obama administration says is a base for Taliban who fight American forces in Afghanistan, and of Muridke, which is a well known base for Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group formed two decades ago by the Pakistani government to fight India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States and India say Lashkar was behind the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in India's financial capital, Mumbai, last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a direct indictment,'' a senior military official said in reference to Muridke. The Americans, he said, were threatening the Pakistanis, saying that if the Pakistani military did not behave according to American wishes, then the Americans would penalize them. ''Some may say this is typical American arrogance,'' said the official who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anger over what is being interpreted as impudent American demands has been building, fanned by other recent frictions -- plans for a bigger American Embassy, the use of an American private security firm to protect American diplomats -- in what was supposed to be a new era  between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fury reached a high on Wednesday, even exceeding longtime complaints about American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants in the tribal areas as being an infringement of sovereignty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In its statement after the generals' monthly meeting, the army said: ''The forum expressed serious concern regarding clauses impacting on national security.'' A ''formal input'' by the military would be sent to Parliament, the army said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zardari held a lengthy meeting with members of his party on Tuesday, many of whom were having difficulty explaining the aid legislation under a barrage of criticism in the press and among the opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afterward, the presidential spokesman called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the legislation ''propaganda'' aimed at ''undermining'' the president's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part of the military's anger focused, the senior military official said, on the affront of not being informed by the civilian government about the stipulations that affected the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The security establishment of the country has not been kept in the loop,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The front-page headline on Wednesday for an article about the meeting between General Kayani and General McChrystal in  The News read: ''Insult! Army tells U.S. military.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a conciliatory address to Parliament on Wednesday evening, the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, argued the legislation was not binding. He assured Parliament that the government would ''never'' allow a foreign power to have access to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His reference to nuclear capability was apparently to allay anger over a reference in the legislation asking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to continue to cooperate with the United States in efforts to dismantle networks trying to acquire nuclear weapons-related materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani commandos rescued 42 hostages early Sunday who were held by militants inside the nation's military headquarters, after gunmen dressed in army fatigues stormed the building in a brazen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18 hours earlier, according to the chief army spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four militants and three hostages were killed in the operation, the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said. He said that the militants, who had taken both soldiers and civilians hostage, had been armed with explosives. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A series of loud explosions and gunshots were heard at the headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi at 6 a.m., shortly before the army announced the freeing of the hostages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the third by Taliban militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a week, and it is a singular embarrassment for the Pakistani Army, exposing its vulnerability to the insurgency that is closely linked with Al Qaeda. It came as the military was planning an offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan, and it was seen as a statement by the militants that they could </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the army first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the initial assault on the headquarters, six people, including a brigadier and a colonel, were killed as the militants broke through a checkpoint in a van. The army had reported initially that there were 10 to 15 hostages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army said Sunday that commandos captured the last militant who took part in the assault. He was identified by the army as Aqeel, who also used the alias Dr. Ufman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration, which is in the midst of reassessing its strategy for the region, has asked the Pakistani military to step up its efforts against the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officials said they were astonished that the militants could penetrate the high-security installation to the extent that they did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One official, speaking anonymously, said the siege represented ''a major security lapse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before ending the standoff, the government vowed to carry out its Waziristan offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I want to give a message to the Taliban that what we did with you in Swat, we will do the same to you there, too,'' Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, referring to the Swat Valley, where the army drove out the Taliban last summer. He identified the militants involved in the assault as Pakistani Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, when 8 to 10 gunmen drove up to what was considered a heavily fortified compound. After a 45-minute gunfight, four of the attackers were killed, General Abbas said, and several others fled into the building. Once inside, the militants took hostages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the headquarters came after the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, warned that the army had become the militants' main target. The army announced two weeks ago that it planned a major offensive in South Waziristan, the Taliban's stronghold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud said last weekend that the Taliban would not let the planned offensive go unanswered. It was his first news conference since taking over from Baitullah Mehsud, who was killed in a missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assault and other recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be the start of the escalation Mr. Mehsud warned about, military analysts said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a suicide bomber blew himself up at the headquarters of the United NationsWorld Food Program in Islamabad on Monday, killing five United Nations workers. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed designed to intimidate international aid workers and the agency that the Taliban has said should leave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, a car bomb killed 48 people in the busiest bazaar at noon on Friday, when it was most crowded. It was one of the most lethal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a city that has become a consistent target of the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Security analysts said the militants had cells planted through out Punjab, the most populous province, and had clearly refined assault techniques from its close links with Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to an account from a senior Pakistani military official who was at the scene when the Rawalpindi </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began, there was initial confusion because the attackers were dressed in army fatigues, and security officers could not tell the difference between soldiers and militants, he said. The van they were driving had military plates, allowing them to approach the checkpoints with less suspicion, an American military official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants were a mixed group, the Pakistani military official said. Some came from the tribal areas, some from Punjab and some from Kashmir. The men made calls on their cellphones demanding release of prisoners from government custody, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another witness, Mansoor Ahmed, told the Geo television network that the men in the van were stopped at a gate. ''Soon heavy firing started,'' he said. ''I saw one terrorist falling down. They have also used hand grenades.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the siege developed at the headquarters, the chief of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was shown on Pakistani television meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on the contentious issue of a $7.5 billion, five-year American aid package that the army says interferes with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani television reported that Mr. Zardari, who has hailed the aid as a major triumph but has come under direct criticism from the army for accepting its conditions, had agreed to take up the army's objections with the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The aid package, aimed at bolstering civilian infrastructure, is separate from military aid, of which the United States has provided $10 billion since 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army had been riding high in public opinion after its offensive against Taliban forces in the Swat Valley in the summer pushed militants out of the area. Stepped up security in Islamabad and Peshawar appeared to have quelled militant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the last few months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And a lull in bombings after Baitullah Mehsud's death was interpreted by security analysts as a sign that the Taliban were in disarray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the new Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, appeared intent  to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before the army struck in South Waziristan, said a retired senior army officer, Brig. Mehmood Shah. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A commentator on national security and former senior police officer, Arbab Hidayatullah, said Saturday that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had occurred because the military had so far failed to ''deliver the mother of all battles'' in South Waziristan, giving the ''terrorists a free hand to deliver themselves.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militants on Monday launched their fourth assault in a week on strategic targets across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, this time with a suicide car bombing against a military vehicle in a crowded market in the northwest, killing 41 people and wounding dozens more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bombing took place in the Shangla District, an area within the Swat Valley but under separate administration. The Pakistani military had declared the valley cleared of militants after an offensive this summer and announced that the Taliban were a shattered force. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the Swat campaign and the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, the militants have been relatively quiet. But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday showed they could still shake the country with serious terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a short period over a wide geographic spread. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the latest in a series clearly intended to prove the Taliban's resilience, to exact revenge for government and American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to discourage the Pakistani military from expanding its campaign into South Waziristan, the heartland of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Air Force has been pounding areas of South Waziristan in the last day, a prelude to a possible ground campaign, military officials said. Hundreds are reported to have fled in recent days in expectation of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, in one of their boldest gambits, 10 militants dressed in army fatigues and armed with automatic weapons, mines, grenades and suicide jackets breached the perimeter of the army headquarters in Rawalpindi in a raid that left 23 people dead and set off a 20-hour siege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The standoff ended Sunday morning with the rescue of 39 hostages by army commandos, but showed that even a building of the intelligence wing of the army was vulnerable to Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, the Pakistani Army announced that it had a telephone intercept showing that the Tehrik-e-Taliban, the umbrella organization of the Pakistani Taliban, was responsible for the assault. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group's deputy, Wali ur-Rehman, was heard telling a colleague by phone after the raid had begun to pray for the success of the operation, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said at a news conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Taliban spokesman, Azam Tariq, told The Associated Press on Monday that the Rawalpindi assault was to avenge Mr. Mehsud's death. ''This was our first small effort and a present to the Pakistani and American governments,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that the raid had been carried out by a Punjabi faction and that the Taliban had given orders to other branches in Sindh, Baluchistan and North-West Frontier Province to carry out similar operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sole surviving Taliban gunman was captured by the military and identified as Muhammad Aqeel, also known as Dr. Usman, because he had once worked with the Army Medical Corps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Aqeel was in serious condition and unconscious from wounds suffered when he tried to blow himself up, the military spokesman said. He is a member of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Punjabi militant group affiliated with Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban, General Abbas said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior police officer in Punjab said Mr. Aqeel led the commando operation against the Sri Lankan cricket team during its visit to Lahore in March, and military officials said he was behind a suicide bombing that killed the army surgeon general in 2008. On Friday, in the busiest bazaar in Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, militants set off a car bomb that killed 48 people. Last Monday, five people were killed when a suicide bomber dressed in military fatigues walked through the security cordon at the World Food Program offices of the United Nations in Islamabad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Shangla on Monday was clearly aimed to shake the confidence of the underfinanced local government and the people who returned to their homes only two months ago after the military operation in Swat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the dead were six soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel, who were part of a quick response force and four newly recruited members of a community police force, a local police official said. Last month, the Taliban sent a suicide bomber to a police training center in the Swat capital, Mingora,   resulting in the deaths of 16 new policemen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> general angrily denounced Monday's bombing as ''a diversionary tactic'' that would not dissuade the Pakistani military from carrying out an expected offensive in South Waziristan. But the officer conceded that there was no ''foolproof antidote'' to stop suicide bombers, and acknowledged that the militants could conduct such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer said the bombing in the crowded market in Shangla District on Monday, as well as the bombing on Friday in Peshawar, could backfire against the militants, and present the Pakistani military and civilian government with a chance to tap into public anger over civilian deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is opportunity in calamity, and we need to be able to capitalize on the public anger over the death of innocent civilians,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak openly about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours after getting off a plane from America's war zones, Joseph R. Biden Jr.  slipped into a chair, shook off his jet lag and reflected on what he had seen. The situation in Iraq, he said, was much improved. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said he saw encouraging signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then he came to Afghanistan and shook his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It has deteriorated significantly,'' he said. ''It's going to be a very heavy lift.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was six days before Mr. Biden was sworn in as vice president in January, and just after he had met with President-elect Barack Obama, who had sent him on the fact-finding mission to figure out just what the new administration was inheriting. Mr. Biden's assessment was even grimmer during his private meeting with Mr. Obama, according to officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the moment they took office, Mr. Biden has been Mr. Obama's in-house pessimist on Afghanistan, the strongest voice against further escalation of American forces there and the leading doubter of the president's strategy. It was a role that may have been lonely at first, but has attracted more company inside the White House as Mr. Obama rethinks the strategy he unveiled just seven months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. Biden, a longtime senator who prided himself on his experience in foreign relations, the role represents an evolution in his own thinking, a shift from his days as a liberal hawk advocating for American involvement in Afghanistan. Month by month, year by year, the story of Mr. Biden's disenchantment with the Afghan government, and by extension with the engagement there, mirrors America's slow but steady turn against the war, with just 37 percent supporting more troops in last week's CBS News poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He came to question some of the assumptions and began asking questions about whether there might be other approaches that might get you as good or better results at lower cost,'' said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who has been consulted by Mr. Biden on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden does not favor abandoning Afghanistan, but his approach would reject the additional troops sought by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and leave the American force in Afghanistan roughly the same, 68,000 troops. Rather than emphasize protecting the Afghan population, he would accelerate training of Afghans to take over the fight while hunting Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and special forces. His view has caught on with many liberals in his party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The vice president is asking great questions and he understands this issue very, very deeply,'' said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Biden's successor as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. ''He's been there many times. He knows the issues and the personalities very well. He's set out a good analysis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond Mr. Biden's strategic concerns, some who participated in administration deliberations earlier this year said he was keenly aware that the country, and particularly his party's liberal base, was growing tired of the war and might not accept many more years of extensive American commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think a big part of it is, the vice president's reading of the Democratic Party is this is not sustainable,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, who led the administration's review this year. ''That's a part of the process that's a legitimate question for a president -- if I do this, can I sustain it with political support at home? That was the argument the vice president was making back in the winter.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Riedel said the public could be persuaded to stick by the war with a well-articulated argument by the president. And others, more harshly, argue that Mr. Biden's judgment on foreign policy has often been off base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They point out that he voted against the successful Persian Gulf war of 1991, voted for the Iraq invasion of 2003, proposed dividing Iraq into three sections in 2006 and opposed the additional troops credited by many with turning Iraq around in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When was the last time Biden was right about anything?'' Thomas E. Ricks, a military writer, wrote in a blog on Sept. 24. Mr. Ricks is affiliated with the Center for a New American Security, a research organization founded by Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden's office rejects that criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''From nuclear arms control to ending ethnic cleaning in the Balkans to confronting the threat of terrorism, the vice president has not only been right on many of the toughest questions of U.S. foreign policy over the past 30 years, he has been consistently ahead of the curve,'' said Jay Carney, his communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden's office rejects that criticism. ''From nuclear arms control to ending ethnic cleansing in the Balkans to confronting the threat of terrorism, the vice president has not only been right on many of the toughest questions of U.S. foreign policy over the past 30 years, he has been consistently ahead of the curve,'' said Jay Carney, his communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden's journey on the American war in Afghanistan began where it did for many political leaders. He strongly supported President George W. Bush's decision to topple the Taliban after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Sept. 11, 2001, and after traveling there in January 2002 was convinced that half-measures were not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the United States invaded Iraq, Mr. Biden's attention shifted, but he eventually expressed concern that attention was being diverted from Afghanistan and refocused on what Democrats were calling ''the good war'' as he opened his campaign for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In January 2007, he opposed Mr. Bush's troop buildup in Iraq by arguing that ''if we're going to surge anywhere,'' then it ''should be Afghanistan.'' In August of that year, when Mr. Obama, too, proposed more troops for Afghanistan, Mr. Biden's camp responded with a statement calling him a ''Johnny-come-lately'' and suggesting that it was ''a little disingenuous'' of Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by the time Mr. Biden traveled to Afghanistan again in February 2008, he was rethinking his views, according to people close to him. He had grown sour on President Hamid Karzai and the Kabul government's pervasive corruption. During a now-famous dinner, Mr. Biden became exasperated by Mr. Karzai's denials about corruption, threw down his napkin and declared, ''This dinner is over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden also engaged in a tough talk with Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the NATO commander in Afghanistan at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His concept was to keep a small footprint, have an offshore strategy as the sole approach to seeking better security and stability in Afghanistan and focus on counterterrorism and the hard-core ideologues who won't change,'' General McNeill said. But the general disagreed: ''It could lead to greater insecurity and instability in that region.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Biden had also been influenced by the difficult years in Iraq. ''The Iraq experience has been an important, formative one in the sense that Biden has been much more aware that fighting insurgents is not entirely a military process,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser who has talked with Mr. Biden about it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Biden visited Afghanistan in January for a third time, he returned increasingly convinced that America's national interest lay in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. With fewer than 100 Qaeda fighters left in Afghanistan, he reasoned, the nation was investing disproportionate resources in the wrong country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview hours after he returned, Mr. Biden sounded deeply pessimistic. ''There's very little governance, there's significant corruption and the drug trade is humongous,'' he said. While some allies had been helpful, he said, ''others have dropped the ball considerably.'' So Mr. Obama needed ''fresh assessment of and assertion of what the goal'' should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nine months later, Mr. Obama is reassessing his goal. While officials anticipate that he will fall between the suggestions from Mr. Biden and his commanding general in Afghanistan, they agree that Mr. Biden has shaped the choices -- not entirely unlike his predecessor, Dick Cheney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are some ironic similarities to Cheney's definition of the job and Biden's in one sense,'' Mr. Haass said. ''They're both people who are not hobbled by their own ambitions, they're both experienced national security hands, and it freed up Cheney and it frees up Biden to give an honest take.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved thousands of troops into the militant stronghold of South Waziristan on Saturday, the army said, beginning a long-anticipated ground offensive against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in treacherous terrain that has stymied the army in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The operation is the most ambitious by the Pakistani Army against the militants, who have unleashed a torrent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against top security installations in the last 10 days in anticipation of the military assault. The militants' targets included the army headquarters where planning for the new offensive had been under way for four months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has been pressing the army to move ahead with the campaign in South Waziristan, arguing that it is vital for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to show resolve against the Qaeda-fortified Pakistani Taliban, which now embrace a vast and dedicated network of militant groups arrayed against the nuclear-armed state. The groups include some nurtured by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have said the fighting there would probably not substantially help the American and NATO effort in Afghanistan because most militants who cross the border to fight there are from a different area in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and because the Taliban stronghold within South Waziristan is not directly along the border. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if successful, the operations could put pressure on Al Qaeda, a pivotal supporter of the Taliban in Afghanistan, providing training and strategic planning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The front in South Waziristan was the fourth operation by the army against the Taliban in a year, and the campaigns in the less remote parts of the country's tribal areas have shown that guerrilla tactics can bedevil an army trained in conventional warfare against its archenemy, India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Bajaur and Mohmand, two tribal areas close to the provincial capital of Peshawar, and far less mountainous than South Waziristan, the army has been forced to launch repeated air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against persistent Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even though much of the area was declared cleared of militants almost a year ago. Civilians who fled Bajaur and Mohmand have been unable to return, and towns flattened by the army have remained in ruins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even in the Swat Valley, where the military was able to make most cities safe enough for residents to return, the army was unable to knock out the Taliban leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Washington, senior American military officials were closely monitoring the long-awaited offensive, with some  expressing skepticism about how extensive a ground campaign the Pakistani Army would actually carry out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is going to be much tougher than their offensives in Swat and Bajaur this year,'' said one top American officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  ''We just don't know how committed the army will be.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Obama administration officials said Saturday they were pleased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at least decided to go ahead with the offensive. Some senior administration officials voiced concerns immediately after the death of Baitullah Mehsud, the country's public enemy No. 1, that the Pakistani military would let up in its counterinsurgency efforts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Precise information about the start of the assault Saturday, which army officials said involved about 28,000 soldiers, was impossible to verify immediately since no reporters are traveling with the troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was clear that the military faced a potent, heavily armed enemy that has been preparing for months, bringing in reinforcements from across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal region, and diverting Taliban fighters  from Afghanistan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In South Waziristan, the Taliban  loyal to the Mehsud tribe are relying on hardened Uzbek fighters, and despite the death of their leader, Baitullah Mehsud, in an American missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, the rest of the Taliban leadership appears largely intact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The guerrillas are practiced at hit-and-run tactics intended to keep the troops bottled up until the snow falls next month. Bunkers and tunnels have been under construction with the help of excavation machinery commandeered in the past several years from local contractors, civilians from South Waziristan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In North-West Frontier Province, civilian officials said Saturday that they had been told by the military that soldiers were moving in a pincer movement from government areas in Shakhai in the west, Razmak in the north into Makeen and Jandola in the east into Spinkai Raghzai. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the last few days, F-16 fighter jets have hammered ammunition depots and fortified bunkers in the mountainous enclave, where the Pakistani Taliban, now led by Hakimullah Mehsud, keep their operations center, according to civilians in Wana who had been reached by telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The region inside a ring of government-held towns, Jandola, Razmak and Shakhai, is the homeland of the Mehsud tribe, who have a reputation as the fiercest of fighters in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a taste of Taliban tactics, an army convoy heading to the area of operations from North Waziristan was hit by a remote-controlled bomb Saturday, killing two soldiers and wounding four others, according to a journalist reached by telephone in Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan. That area in North Waziristan was supposed to have been neutralized after talks between a militant group and the military, the journalist said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the areas where the army is headed are 6,000 to 7,000 feet high. In previous operations against the Taliban in the same area -- in 2004, in 2005 and again in early 2008 -- the army settled for a truce. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This time, under the leadership of its chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, the army is better prepared. It also has been left little choice about whether to take on the operation given the onslaught of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Taliban and Al Qaeda against the Pakistani state, politicians have said in the past several weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States was expected to provide additional surveillance, reconnaissance and eavesdropping equipment to the Pakistani military, and possibly increase noncombat Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surveillance flights over the rugged mountainous battle area to help the Pakistani forces identify and single out Taliban strongholds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier this summer, the United States resumed secret </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flights performing military surveillance in the tribal areas to provide Pakistani commanders with a wide array of videos and other information on militants, according to American officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Army officials said the approximately  28,000 Pakistani soldiers  involved in the operation in South Waziristan   were set to face about 10,000 militants, including 1,500 particularly tough Uzbek fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The proportion of soldiers to militants did not appear to be very high, some military specialists said, noting that in the Swat Valley in May, the Pakistani Army fielded more than 30,000 soldiers against a similar number of less experienced militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late Saturday night, the army's Web site reported that four soldiers had been killed so far in the offensive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army expected the South Waziristan operation to last about two months, a period that stretches into the winter season there, a Pakistani official who has been briefed by the military said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military was confident that this time the soldiers could retake and hold the Mehsud area, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But military experts noted that South Waziristan was at the southern tip of the tribal areas and needed a much longer supply line than Bajaur and Mohmand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tens of thousands of civilians have fled South Waziristan in the past few months in anticipation of fighting, moving in with relatives all over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The preparations for the South Waziristan campaign had been thorough, but the effort is fraught with uncertainties, said a former brigadier, Javaid Hussain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is the fear of the unknown that is weighing very heavily on those involved in the planning,'' he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS President Obama and his advisers contemplate a new course for Afghanistan, many commentators are suggesting analogies with earlier conflicts, particularly the war in Vietnam. Such comparisons can be useful, but only if the characterizations of earlier wars are accurate and lessons are appropriately applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Vietnam is particularly tricky. While avoiding the missteps made there is of course a priority, few seem aware of the many successful changes in strategy undertaken in the later years of the conflict. The credit for those accomplishments goes in large part to three men: Ellsworth Bunker, who became the American ambassador to South Vietnam in 1967; William Colby, the C.I.A. officer in charge of rural ''pacification'' efforts; and Gen. Creighton Abrams, who became the top American commander there in 1968. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A closer look at key aspects of how these men rethought their war may prove instructive to those considering our options in Afghanistan today. Among their principles were these: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fight one war: Abrams, Bunker and Colby agreed that the war would be fought -- and won or lost -- in the villages. They decided to put equal priority on all key aspects of the war -- thus the improvement of South Vietnam's armed forces and the elimination of covert Vietcong bases and refuges in rural areas were given the same emphasis as large combat operations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, it is vital that American and NATO troops get out of their protected bases to work alongside Afghan forces and build trust with civilians. In some ways this may be trickier than in Vietnam, as our troops will have to navigate the tribal and ethnic rivalries that have long divided Afghan society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rethink combat operations: The early strategy in Vietnam was to use large units in ''search and destroy'' sweeps -- often on ground of the enemy's choosing in the deep jungle. Abrams decided instead to try ''clear and hold'' operations, in which small patrols were sent to villages to protect the populace. These troops were followed by South Vietnamese security forces -- which Abrams made sure would get better training and equipment and were integrated into the regular army -- to provide the ''hold.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, combat does little good unless allied or Afghan forces remain behind to keep the Taliban from simply moving back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Restrain the use of force: Early on, Abrams said, ''My problem is colored blue.'' By that he meant that friendly forces (usually portrayed in blue on battle maps, as contrasted to the enemy shown in red) were causing undue ''collateral damage'' to the South Vietnamese people and their property. He reined in the use of heavy firepower like artillery and tactical airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Allied forces in Afghanistan may have to accept increased risks to themselves as the price of protecting the population. There have been some grumblings that they are hampered by the rules of engagement, and perhaps in platoon-level operations that it true. But Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan, is right that Western forces have to cut down on civilian deaths caused by air power and reckless use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Create an effective central government: As Nguyen Van Thieu, who became South Vietnam's president in 1967, gained experience and influence, senior Americans came to regard him as the ''No. 1 pacification officer.'' He traveled extensively, promoting and evaluating local programs. And by 1972 his ''Land to the Tiller'' initiative had achieved genuine land reform, distributing two and a half million acres of land to nearly 400,000 farmers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has no signature triumph like Land to the Tiller, nor has he made many efforts to reach out to average Afghans. Perhaps Washington should make some of its support to his government contingent on anticorruption efforts and delivering real services to his people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Support local governments: In Vietnam, rural hamlets were able to elect their own officials, who were sent to training sessions in the port city of Vung Tau. President Thieu spoke to every class, emphasizing that they had to be ''little presidents'' and make good use of the resources that the central government would provide for economic growth, health care and schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the diversified population of Afghanistan there has been too much emphasis on central government -- if the Karzai government lags in giving money and supplies to local and tribal leaders, the United States should consider doling out more aid directly to them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gather intelligence: ''The intelligence is the most important part of this whole damn thing,'' Abrams told a visiting officer. ''And if that's good, we can handle anything.'' The best way to root out the enemy's secret bases in Vietnam was to get good information from villagers and ''ralliers,'' former Vietcong rebels who had switched sides.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Afghanistan, a continuing security presence in contested areas will be key to getting Afghans and former insurgents to aid the war effort. As long as they fear Taliban reprisal, locals will stay silent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Build the economy: Vietnam depended on rice, and widespread fighting and enemy gains in early years took many acres of land out of cultivation. Pacification efforts put some of that land back into production and re-opened local markets, while the introduction of genetically engineered ''miracle rice'' greatly increased yields. In Afghanistan, finding viable alternative crops for farmers now growing opium poppies would seem to be a first order of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Improve security: Protection of the people (not body counts, as in the earlier period) became the measure of progress in Vietnam. The appropriate metrics to watch in Afghanistan are probably economic growth, the percentage of children attending school and health data, along with freedom of movement within and between population centers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Control the borders: In South Vietnam, allied forces were never able to seal off borders with Cambodia, Laos or North Vietnam. The self-imposed prohibitions against going outside South Vietnam with ground forces allowed the enemy to use border areas for training, supply routes and sanctuary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similarly, the Taliban uses the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border as its own barrier, and American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can do only so much. Either Washington must find a way to get the Pakistanis to step up the fight against the terrorists, or  consider operations across the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maintain political support at home: All that was accomplished on the battlefield in the latter years of Vietnam was lost when Congress, having tired of the whole endeavor, drastically cut support for South Vietnam. Neither Lyndon Johnson nor Richard Nixon was able to rally public and press support for the war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama has said that Afghanistan is a war of necessity.  If so, he must put his political capital behind it. As he and his advisers plan the new course for the war, he must also come up with a new approach for selling it to Congress and the American people. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal stepped off the whirring Black Hawk and headed straight into town. He had come to Garmsir, a dusty outpost along the Helmand River in southern Afghanistan, to size up the war that President Obama has asked him to save. McChrystal pulled off his flak jacket and helmet. His face, skeletal and austere, seemed a piece of the desert itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was surrounded by a clutch of bodyguards, normal for a four-star general, and an array of the Marine officers charged with overseeing the town. Garmsir had been under Taliban control until May 2008, when a force of American Marines swept in and cleared it. Since then, the British, then the Americans, have been holding it and trying, ever so slowly, to build something in Garmsir -- a government, an army, a police force -- for the first time since the war began more than eight years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Marines around McChrystal, including the local battalion commander, Lt. Col. Christian Cabaniss, looked surprised, even alarmed, when McChrystal removed his protective gear. But as the group walked the rutted streets into Garmsir's bazaar, they began taking off their helmets, too. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Who owns the land here?'' McChrystal asked, peering up the street and into the shops. ''Is it owned by the farmers or by landlords?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the sort of question a sociologist, or an economist, would ask. No one offered an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you owned 200 acres here, would you live on it, or would you live somewhere else?'' McChrystal asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The entourage entered the bazaar. The Afghans sensed that an important American had arrived, and they began to gather in groups inside the stalls. Then the general stopped and turned.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What do you need here?'' McChrystal asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A translator turned the general's words into Pashto.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We need schools!'' one Afghan called back. ''Schools!'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're working on that,'' McChrystal said. ''Those things take time.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal walked some more, engaging another group of Afghans. He posed the same question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Security,'' a man said. ''We need security. Security first, then the other things will be possible.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That is what we are trying to do,'' McChrystal said. ''But it's going to take time. Success takes time.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The questions kept coming, and the answer was the same. After a couple of hours, McChrystal put on his helmet and flak jacket, boarded the Black Hawk and flew to another town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Success takes time, but how much time does Stanley McChrystal have? The war in Afghanistan is now in its ninth year. The Taliban, measured by the number of their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are stronger than at any time since the Americans toppled their government at the end of 2001. American soldiers and Marines are dying at a faster rate than ever before. Polls in the United States show that opposition to the war is growing steadily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Worse yet, for all of America's time in Afghanistan -- for all the money and all the blood -- the lack of accomplishment is manifest wherever you go. In Garmsir, there is nothing remotely resembling a modern state that could take over if America and its NATO allies left. Tour the country with a general, and you will see very quickly how vast and forbidding this country is and how paltry the effort has been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And finally, there is the government in Kabul. President Hamid Karzai, once the darling of the West, rose to the top of nationwide elections in August on what appears to be a tide of fraud. The Americans and their NATO allies are confronting the possibility that the government they are supporting, building and defending is a rotten shell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his initial assessment of the country, sent to President Obama early last month, McChrystal described an Afghanistan on the brink of collapse and an America at the edge of defeat. To reverse the course of the war, McChrystal presented President Obama with what could be the most momentous foreign-policy decision of his presidency: escalate or fail. McChrystal has  reportedly asked for 40,000 additional American troops -- there are 65,000 already here -- and an accelerated effort to train Afghan troops and police and build an Afghan state. If President Obama can't bring himself to step up the fight, McChrystal suggested, then he might as well give up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Inadequate resources,'' McChrystal wrote, ''will likely result in failure.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The magnitude of the choice presented by McChrystal, and now facing President Obama, is difficult to overstate. For what McChrystal is proposing is not a temporary, Iraq-style surge -- a rapid influx of American troops followed by a withdrawal. McChrystal's plan is a blueprint for an extensive American commitment to build a modern state in Afghanistan, where one has never existed, and to bring order to a place famous for the empires it has exhausted. Even under the best of circumstances, this effort would most likely last many more years, cost hundreds of billions of dollars and entail the deaths of many more American women and men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that's if it succeeds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few days after McChrystal filed his report, I sat down with him in his headquarters in Kabul. He seemed upbeat and relaxed. The report was still secret -- it hadn't yet leaked to the public. The ensuing furor was still to come, as was talk that McChrystal was considering resigning, which he was forced to publicly dispel. The atmosphere was not tense -- not yet. Only urgent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I took this job because I was asked to take it, and because it is very, very important,'' McChrystal told me. ''Admiral Mullen'' -- head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- ''specifically said to me: 'You go out, you decide what needs to be done, and you tell me whatever you need to do that. Don't constrain yourself because of politics. You tell me what you need.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked him about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I didn't get any assurances from anyone that I would be given any amount of time,'' McChrystal said. ''I didn't get any assurances from anyone that I would be given any amount of resources. I didn't ask for any assurances.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a moment, McChrystal paused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't feel like the lonely man in the arena,'' he said, ''with all the pressure on my shoulders.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE MARINES WERE walking along the sandy road when the Afghans lined up to watch the bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Marines, members of Echo Company of the Second Battalion, Eighth Marine Regiment, had plodded through a mile of sodden cornfields in the heat of Helmand Province and climbed a rock promontory to an observation post once manned by soldiers of the Soviet Union. They arrived in early July as part of the big push ordered by President Obama; General McChrystal had visited their command post in Garmsir, 12 miles up the road, three days before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Marines had been in plain view for more than two hours. And when they moved down from the old Soviet lookout and walked up the dirt path that runs alongside the hamlet of Mian Poshteh, the Afghans started to come out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first, a lone man walked along the edge of one of Mian Poshteh's mud-brick houses. Then he stopped and turned and stood, watching. Then another man, this one in an irrigation ditch, stuck his head up over the ledge. A pair of children stopped playing. They turned to watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Something's going down,'' Sgt. Jonathan Delgado said. He was 22 and from Kissimmee, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Watch that guy,'' said Lance Cpl. Joshua Vance, pointing. He was also 22, from Raleigh, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two more Afghans arrived. They stopped and stood and looked at a spot just ahead of the Marines. A man on a motorcycle drove past, driving slowly, turning his head. Then the bomb went off. It had been buried in the path itself, a few feet under the sand, a few feet in front of the Marines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blast from the bomb was sharp and deep, and a dirty cloud shot up a hundred feet. Waves from the blast shot out, toward the village and toward us. Ten Marines at the front of the line disappeared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're hit! We're hit!'' Delgado shouted, and everyone ran to the front.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marines began staggering out of the cloud. They were holding their ears and eyes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''God, I'm still here,'' Cpl. Matt Kaiser said, rubbing his ears. Kaiser had been at the front, sweeping the ground with a mine detector. He was from Oak Harbor, Ohio. ''I'm still here.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No one's hit,'' Delgado said. ''Jesus, no one's hit.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rest of the young men staggered out of the cloud while the Marines trained their guns on Mian Poshteh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghans were gone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My bell's rung pretty bad,'' Kaiser said. He was shaking his head and glancing up and down and half laughing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bomber had missed. The weapon had been what the Marines refer to as ''command-detonated,'' which meant that someone, probably in Mian Poshteh, had punched a trigger -- on a wire leading to the bomb -- when the Marines came up the path. The triggerman needed to remember precisely where he had buried his bomb. Clearly, he had forgotten. If he had waited five more seconds, he would have killed several Marines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Delgado, Kaiser and the others gathered themselves and walked toward Mian Poshteh. On their radio, the Marines could hear voices coming from inside the village. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Is everything ready?'' a voice said in Pashto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everything is ready,'' another voice said. ''Let's see what they do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Marines stayed back. Earlier in the war, they would have gone into Mian Poshteh; they would have surrounded the village and kicked in doors until they found the bomber. Most likely they would have found him -- and maybe along the way they would have killed some civilians and smashed up some homes. And made a lot of enemies. The Marines are a very different force now, with very different goals. They walked to within 50 feet of Mian Poshteh, and Lt. Patrick Bragan shouted: ''Send us five men. Five men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Minutes passed, and five Afghans appeared. They were unarmed and ordinary looking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have no idea who did that,'' an old man named Fazul Mohammed said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maybe they came at night,'' a man named Assadullah said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I only heard the explosion,'' a man named Syed Wali said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The face of Lieutenant Bragan was pink from the heat and from pleading. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All you have to do is tell us,'' he said. ''We're here to help you.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Marines gave up. Near sunset, they started back the way they came, through the head-high corn. Delgado turned to one of his buddies, Cpl. John Shymanik, 22. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They didn't get us today,'' Delgado said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're still trying, though,'' Shymanik said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL SAT at the head of a U-shaped bank of tables in a sealed room at Bagram Airfield, a main hub of the war. He was surrounded by five giant video screens. On each screen was another general -- American, German, Dutch, French, Italian -- each commanding a different part of Afghanistan. It was McChrystal's morning briefing, known as the commander's update. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One by one, the generals scrolled through the events from the day before: a roadside bomb in Khost, small-arms fire in Ghazni, a British soldier killed in Helmand Province. Then one of the European generals started talking about an airstrike. A group of Taliban insurgents had attacked a coalition convoy, and the soldiers called for air support. A Hellfire missile, the European general said, obliterated an Afghan compound. The general -- he cannot be named because of the confidentiality of the meeting -- was moving on to the next topic when McChrystal stopped him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Can you come back to that, please?'' McChrystal said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal's voice is higher than you would expect for a four-star general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes, sir,'' the European general said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We just struck a compound,'' McChrystal said. ''I would like for you to explain to me the process you used to shoot a Hellfire missile into a compound that might have had civilians in it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The European commander looked at an aide and muttered something. The killing of Afghan civilians, usually caused by inadvertent American and NATO airstrikes, has become the most sensitive issue between the Afghans and their Western guests. Each time civilians are killed, the Taliban launch a campaign of very public propaganda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Were there civilians in that compound?'' McChrystal asked. He was leaning into the microphone on the table. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commander started to talk, but McChrystal kept going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Who made that decision?'' McChrystal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An aide handed the European general a sheaf of papers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm sorry, but the system is not responsive enough for us to get that kind of information that quickly,'' the general said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal's face began to tighten. Generals tend to treat one another with the utmost deference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We bomb a compound, and I don't know about it until the next morning?'' McChrystal said. ''Don't just tell me, 'Yeah, it's O.K.' I want to know about it. I'm being a hard-ass about it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The European general looked down at his papers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It seems it was not a Hellfire missile but a 500-pound bomb,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal took off his reading glasses and looked around the room -- at the video screens and the other American officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Gentlemen, we need to understand the implications of what we are doing,'' he said. ''Air power contains the seeds of our own destruction. A guy with a long-barrel rifle runs into a compound, and we drop a 500-pound bomb on it? Civilian casualties are not just some reality with the Washington press. They are a reality for the Afghan people. If we use airpower irresponsibly, we can lose this fight.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LATER THAT DAY, during a drive through Kabul, McChrystal told me that he had decided to drastically restrict the circumstances under which airstrikes would be permitted: for all practical purposes, he was banning bombs and missiles in populated areas unless his men were in danger of being overrun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even if it means we are going to step away from a firefight and fight them another day, that's O.K.,'' McChrystal told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal's missive was the first in an array he has drafted aimed at radically transforming the way America and its allies wage war here. In his first weeks on the job, McChrystal issued directives instructing his men on how to comport themselves with Afghans (''Think of how you would expect a foreign army to operate in your neighborhood, among your families and your children, and act accordingly''); how to fight (''Think of counterinsurgency as an argument to win the support of the people''); even how to drive (''in ways that respect the safety and well-being of the Afghan people''). At the heart of McChrystal's strategy are three principles: protect the Afghan people, build an Afghan state and make friends with whomever you can, including insurgents. Killing the Taliban is now among the least important things that are expected of NATO soldiers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You can kill Taliban forever,'' McChrystal said, ''because they are not a finite number.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That strategy is underscored by an extraordinary sense of urgency -- that eight years into this war the margin for error for the Americans has shrunk to zero. ''If every soldier is authorized to make one mistake,'' McChrystal said, ''then we lose the war.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Afghanistan is not Iraq, McChrystal's plan does resemble in some ways that of General David H. Petraeus, who took command of American forces in Iraq in early 2007, when the country was disintegrating in a civil war. For four years, the American military had tried to crush the Iraqi insurgency and got the opposite: the insurgency bloomed, and the country imploded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By refocusing their efforts on protecting Iraqi civilians, American troops were able to cut off the insurgents from their base of support. Then the Americans struck peace deals with tens of thousands of former fighters -- the phenomenon known as the Sunni Awakening -- while at the same time fashioning a formidable Iraqi army. After a bloody first push, violence in Iraq dropped to its lowest levels since the war began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was all in,'' Petraeus told me about that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so if it was Petraeus who saved Iraq from cataclysm, it now falls to McChrystal to save Afghanistan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petraeus and McChrystal are in fact close -- their bond solidified in the crucible of Iraq. Petraeus, now head of the U.S. military's Central Command, with overall responsibility for both Iraq and Afghanistan, pushed McChrystal for the job. ''He was a key part of the team in Iraq,'' Petraeus told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now 55, Stanley McChrystal is the son of Herbert J. McChrystal Jr., an Army general who served in Germany during the American occupation and fought in Korea and Vietnam. Stanley McChrystal was the fourth child in a family of five boys and one girl; all of them grew up to serve in the military or marry someone who did. ''My dad was always the soldier I wanted to be,'' McChrystal said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He graduated from West Point in 1976, at the Army's post-Vietnam nadir. Over the next 30 years, McChrystal ascended the ranks, mostly by way of the elite, secretive wing of Special Operations, in units like the Rangers. He served as a staff officer and an operations officer in the first gulf war and did stints at Harvard and the Council on Foreign Relations (where he is remembered for running a dozen miles each morning to the council's offices on the Upper East Side).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With his long and gaunt face and his long and lean body, McChrystal looks almost preternaturally alert -- coiled, hungry. He pushes himself mercilessly, sleeping four or five hours a night, eating one meal a day. He runs eight miles at a clip, usually with an audiobook at his ears. ''I was the fastest runner at Fort Stewart, Ga., until he arrived,'' Petraeus told me recently. ''He's a tremendous athlete.'' On a recent daylong helicopter trip touring bases around the country, McChrystal yawned throughout the day -- the only evidence of his exhaustion. He drank regularly from a large mug of coffee, black.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As McChrystal drives himself, he sometimes affords little tolerance to those who do not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  V.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MCCHRYSTAL WAS ONLY a month into his new job when he strode into the area inside NATO's International Security Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul known as Destille Gardens. A collection of one-story buildings with a courtyard and patio, it is the only thing at headquarters that resembles a lounge or a recreation area. Soldiers and Marines -- most of them staff officers -- would gather there for coffee and even, if they were European, a glass of beer or wine. It's a world away from Helmand Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal was coming for a haircut, and as he walked through the courtyard, he passed a table of coalition officers chatting and drinking. According to several officers present, his face showed immediate disapproval, but no one noticed and he kept on going. Twenty minutes later, when McChrystal walked back across the courtyard, his hair freshly trimmed, the officers were still at their table. Some of them had dozed off. The general's mouth tightened. He walked over to their table. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He woke one officer and said: ''Good afternoon, I'm Stan McChrystal. Is there a problem with your office space?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He turned and walked off. Six weeks later, McChrystal issued an order banning alcohol from I.S.A.F. headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet for all his asceticism, McChrystal displays a subtlety that suggests a wider view of the world. ''If you were to go into his house, he has this unreal library,'' Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn, McChrystal's intelligence chief and longtime friend, told me this summer. ''You can go over and touch a binding and ask him, 'What's that one about?' And he'll just start. His bad habit is wandering around old bookstores. He's not one of these guys that just reads military books. He reads about weird things too. He's reading a book about Shakespeare right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on his recent reading list this past summer: ''Vietnam: A History,'' Stanley Karnow's unsparing account of America's defeat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When McChrystal decided to come to Afghanistan, a lot of people signed up to come with him. ''I first worked for him in the gulf war, and General McChrystal was the sharpest, fastest staff officer I have ever come across -- and I had been serving for 20 years at that point,'' said Graeme Lamb, a retired British general and former commander of the Special Air Service, Britain's equivalent of Delta Force. ''He could take ideas, concepts, directions, and he could turn them into language, into understanding, and pass it out at an electric rate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lamb was getting ready to retire earlier this year when McChrystal asked him to join his team. Lamb flew to Washington to talk it over, and the two men sealed the deal at a Mexican restaurant in Arlington, Va. ''I don't think there is a Brit that could have made the same call,'' Lamb told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One big question hovering over McChrystal is whether his experience in Iraq truly prepares him for the multiheaded challenge that faces him now. For nearly five years, McChrystal served as chief of the Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the military's commando units, including the Army Delta Force and the Navy Seals. (Until recently, the Pentagon refused to acknowledge that the command even existed.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As JSOC's commander, McChrystal spent no time trying to win over the Iraqis or training Iraqi forces or building the governing capacity of the Iraqi state. In Iraq (and, for about a third of his time, in Afghanistan), McChrystal's job, and that of the men under his command, was, almost exclusively, to kill and capture insurgents and terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rescue of Iraq from the cataclysm that it had become by 2006 is an epic tale of grit and blood and luck. By February of that year, Iraq had descended into a full-blown civil war, with a thousand civilians dying every month. Its central actors were the gunmen of Al Qaeda, who, with their suicide bombers, carried out large-scale massacres of Shiite civilians; and the Shiite militias, some of them in Iraqi uniforms, who retaliated by massacring thousands of young Sunni men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Breaking the cycle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and revenge was crucial to stopping the civil war, and it was here, McChrystal and his colleagues say, that JSOC played a critical role. In a series of operations that climaxed in 2006 and 2007, McChrystal's commandos set out to destroy Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The aim was to go after the middle of their network -- in a regular army, their senior noncommissioned officers. We tried to cause the network to collapse,'' McChrystal told me. ''We took it to an art form. It really became a machine.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal said that as early as the fall of 2006 -- when Al Qaeda was at its murderous peak -- it looked like the group was coming apart. ''We sensed that Al Qaeda was going to implode,'' he said. ''We could just feel it. We were watching it and feeling it and seeing it.'' In addition to driving the civil war, Al Qaeda gunmen were seen as a main obstacle to Iraq's Sunnis' reconciling with the Americans and the Iraqi government. By degrading Al Qaeda, McChrystal and others say, they helped significantly reduce the civil war, and by so doing created a space that allowed a broader movement of reconciliation -- the Sunni Awakening -- to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What General McChrystal was doing with the forces he had under command in Iraq was absolutely essential to setting the conditions that allowed the Awakening to move forward,'' Lamb, the former S.A.S. head, told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most significant moment in McChrystal's tenure was on June 6, 2006, when a crucial piece of information came across one of JSOC's video screens. For months, according to sources involved in the operation (though not McChrystal), McChrystal and his commandos had been hunting Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian head of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Zarqawi, of course, was the man responsible for the murder of many hundreds of innocents in car bombings and suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McChrystal was so desperate that he created a separate task force to get him. The task force narrowly missed Zarqawi several times; a few months before the June sighting, the operator of a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a pilotless airplane, had spotted Zarqawi in a taxicab in Anbar Province. He lost him -- and Zarqawi jumped out -- when the operator changed the focus on the Predator's camera lens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This time, McChrystal believed, Zarqawi was in his sights. The tip was long in coming, a result of thousands of hours of intelligence work, but according to several sources, it boiled down to this: Under interrogation, an Iraqi insurgent who was a member of Zarqawi's inner circle pointed to an Iraqi named Abd al-Rahman, who, the insurgent said, served as Zarqawi's spiritual adviser. Whenever Rahman was preparing to meet Zarqawi, the source told the Americans, he would send his wife and family out of Baghdad the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal and his JSOC team watched Rahman for 17 consecutive days. Then, on June 6, 2006, it happened -- Rahman's family was seen piling into a vehicle and leaving the city. The next day, a Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed Rahman himself as he made his way northeast out of Baghdad, to a small house in a palm grove near the village of Hibhib. Rahman went inside. McChrystal had a commando team on the ground, 18 minutes away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As McChrystal and his staff watched through the Predator camera, a man, dressed in black, walked from the house to the edge of the road. The man looked to his right, then to his left. It was Zarqawi. He walked back inside. They were sure it was him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At an operations center, a senior Special Forces commander, realizing that time was short, ordered an airstrike. Two F-16's were dispatched; one of them was hooked up to a refueling plane; the second jet was told to go alone. A pair of 500-pound bombs killed Zarqawi. McChrystal and his staff were waiting at JSOC's headquarters in Balad when the corpse came in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal's tenure as JSOC's commander was not flawless. JSOC never got its most wanted quarry, neither Osama bin Laden nor Ayman al-Zawahiri. One of JSOC's units, Task Force 6-26, was cited for abusing detainees, many of them at a site known as Camp Nama, in Baghdad. McChrystal himself was not implicated, but at least 34 task-force members were disciplined. ''There were cases where people made mistakes, and they were punished,'' McChrystal told me. ''What we did was establish a policy and atmosphere that said that is not what you do. That is not acceptable.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also signed off on the Silver Star recommendation for Cpl. Pat Tillman, the N.F.L. star and Army Ranger killed in Afghanistan in April 2004. The medal recommendation erroneously suggested that Tillman was killed by enemy fire; in fact he was killed accidentally by his own men, which McChrystal suspected at the time. The medal was awarded at a memorial service for Tillman, in which he was lionized as a man killed by the enemy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal said he did indeed sign off on the recommendation for Tillman, because he believed it was warranted. The award was for valor, and Tillman had been extraordinarily brave, regardless of who killed him. McChrystal said he never intended for Tillman's death to be exploited politically or to convey an incorrect impression about his death. ''I certainly regret the way this came out,'' McChrystal told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for his current job, McChrystal said there are two lessons from Iraq that apply to Afghanistan. The first is that his role -- killing insurgents -- worked there only because it was part of a much larger effort to not only defeat the insurgency but also to build an Iraqi state that could stand on its own. ''Ours was just a supporting effort,'' he said. The second lesson is perhaps more startling. It is that no situation, no matter how dire, is ever irredeemable -- if you have the time, resources and the correct strategy. In the spring of 2006, Iraq seemed lost. The dead were piling up. The society was disintegrating. One possible conclusion was that it was time for the United States to cut its losses in a country that it never truly understood. But the American military believed it had found a strategy that worked, and it hung in there, and it finally turned the tide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One of the big take-aways from Iraq was that you have to not lose confidence in what you are doing,'' McChrystal said. ''We were able to go to the edge of the abyss without losing hope.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL in Afghanistan in June 2009, McChrystal sat down with the commanders of the 82nd Airborne Division, which oversees a broad swath of eastern Afghanistan. The briefing, given by the 82nd's officers, was sophisticated but sobering: corruption in the Afghan government is pervasive, the officers said; the insurgency, supported from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is resilient. Every valley and every village is different, each its own patchwork of ethnic groups and tribes, each with its own history. The Americans are having to learn them all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The environment is so complex that there is no overarching solution,'' Brig. Gen. William Fuller told McChrystal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the briefing was finished, McChrystal looked around the room. ''Gentlemen, I am coming into this job with 12 months to show demonstrable progress here -- and 24 months to have a decisive impact,'' he said. ''That's how long we have to convince the Taliban, the Afghan people and the American people that we're going to be successful. In 24 months, it has to be obvious that we have the clear upper hand and that things are moving in the right direction. That's not a choice. That's a reality.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a tour of bases around Afghanistan, McChrystal repeated this mantra to all his field commanders: Time is running out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet even if McChrystal's plan succeeds, even if he can turn the Afghan venture around, neither he nor anyone else in the upper echelons of the military believes that the job -- the one President Obama has given them to do -- will be finished then. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It feels like Iraq in 2004,'' said Michael Flynn, McChrystal's deputy. ''Part of it is that the insurgency is stronger -- we didn't realize how strong it was. What we are trying to do is make sure everyone understands what it is we are facing -- a much stronger insurgency, certainly much more capable. Their capacity to lay I.E.D.'s on the battlefield, for instance -- it's just stunning.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked General Flynn to imagine the future here. ''We are going to go in and ask for some resources,'' he told me. ''If those resources are brought to bear in a timely manner, I believe that it's probably going to take us three years to really turn the insurgency to the point where it's waning instead of waxing. To do that we have to fix the Afghan security forces, we have to build their capacity and capability, and we have to absolutely culturally change the way they operate. And then I think beyond those three years, we are looking at another two years when the government of Afghanistan and the security forces of Afghanistan begin to take a lot more personal responsibility. The challenge to us is: What can we do in 12 months? What should we expect? If people's expectations are that we are going to have the south turned around, for instance, it's not going to happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The strategy that McChrystal, Flynn and the other senior commanders want to employ in Afghanistan has two main prongs: one hard, one soft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the military arena, McChrystal wants to put as many of his men as close to the Afghan people as he can. That means closing some of the smaller bases in remote valleys and opening them in densely populated areas like the Helmand River valley. Here, at least, military force will play a central role, at least in the early phase of his strategy, as the Americans fight their way into areas they have not been in before.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The insurgency has to have access to the people,'' McChrystal told me. ''So we literally want to go in there and squat among the people. We want to make the insurgents come to us. Make them be the aggressors. What I want to do is get on the inside, looking out -- instead of being on the outside looking in.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There will be a lot of fighting,'' McChrystal added. ''If we do this right, the insurgents will have to fight us. They will have no choice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that's the rub: the population-focused strategy requires more troops -- as many as 40,000 more. This is the decision that confronts President Obama and his advisers now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other part of the military option is one with which McChrystal is familiar but does not completely control. It's his old portfolio -- killing and capturing insurgents and terrorists. Much of that is being carried out in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where Al Qaeda's leadership has gathered in havens just across the border from Afghanistan. Both bin Laden and Zawahiri are believed to be hiding there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a C.I.A.-led program using Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hunt down and kill leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban has proved remarkably successful, even if controversial inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself. To date, American officials say, they have killed 11 of the top 20 Al Qaeda leaders, without having to launch large-scale military operations across the border.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With its 180 million people, several dozen nuclear warheads and havens for Al Qaeda and the Taliban, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is one wild card in McChrystal's campaign. ''If we are good here, it will have a good effect on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he told me. ''But if we fail here, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not be able to solve their problems -- it would be like burning leaves on a windy day next door. And if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> implodes, it will be very hard for us to succeed.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The softer side of McChrystal's strategy has two main thrusts: training Afghan soldiers and police and persuading insurgents to change sides. It is here where the best chances of long-term success in Afghanistan may lie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first of these is a vast, expensive and painstaking project. In the ninth year of the war, Afghan forces are neither large nor able enough to take over for NATO. The Afghan Army has about 85,000 soldiers, and the police force has about 80,000 men. McChrystal wants to boost the size of the army to about 240,000 and the police to 160,000. ''I think we can do it,'' he told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But experience suggests that it won't be easy. In Iraq, the building of the security forces was fraught with disaster: in 2004 and 2005, Iraqi soldiers and the police disintegrated whenever they came under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In later years, Iraqi forces became more sectarian, with some Shiite-dominated units carrying out massacres of Sunni civilians. It was only much later -- by early 2008 -- that the Iraqi Army and the police began to show promise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Iraq was an urban and literate society. Afghanistan is neither. The Afghan police are widely seen as corrupt and complicit in the opium trade -- the world's largest. And while many Afghan soldiers have shown themselves willing to fight, it usually falls to the Americans and their NATO allies to pay them, feed them and support them in the field. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier this year, Maj. Gen. Richard Formica, who oversees the training of the Afghan security forces, spoke to me about the difficulties of creating an army in a country where only one in four adults is literate. ''What percentage of police recruits can read?'' Formica asked when we met at his headquarters in Kabul. ''When I was down in Helmand, where the Brits were training police officers, they said not only could none of them read but they didn't understand what a classroom was. How can you train officers if they can't write arrest reports?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps McChrystal's most intriguing idea is his belief that he can persuade large numbers of Taliban to change sides. Coaxing insurgents back into the fold was, after all, one key to pulling Iraq back from the brink of apocalypse. Beginning in late 2006, tens of thousands of Sunni tribesmen, many of them former insurgents, agreed to stop fighting and to come onto the payroll, usually as policemen. Almost overnight, the Iraqi insurgency was reduced to Al Qaeda fanatics and a handful of others who could be targeted by McChrystal's commandos in JSOC. This shaky -- very shaky -- arrangement is still keeping what peace there is in Iraq today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal says he intends to begin a similar effort in Afghanistan. The idea, he said, would not be to try to flip the Taliban's leaders -- that's not likely -- but rather its foot soldiers. The premise of the program, McChrystal says, is that most of the Taliban's fighters are not especially committed ideologically and could be brought into society with promises of jobs and protection. ''I'd like to go pretty high up,'' McChrystal said, referring to the Taliban's hierarchy. ''It could be people who are commanders with significant numbers of troops. I think they can be given the opportunity to come in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The effort, McChrystal said, is based on his own reading of the Taliban and of Pashtun culture: most of the people fighting the United States, he argued, are motivated by local and personal grievances. They want more of a voice in local governance, for instance, or they want jobs. ''Historically, the Pashtuns are very practical people,'' McChrystal told me. ''Pashtun culture adjudicates disagreements in a way that mitigates blood feuds. The Pashtun people go out of their way not to do things that cause permanent feuds. They have always been willing to change positions, change sides. I don't think much of the Taliban are ideologically driven; I think they are practically driven. I'm not sure they wouldn't flip to our side.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To help him achieve this, McChrystal recruited his old friend Graeme Lamb, who played a similar role in Iraq. The trick in Iraq, Lamb said, was timing: by late 2006, many Iraqis, even the insurgents, had grown tired of fighting. ''What we did in Iraq in mid-2006 -- had we tried to do it in mid-2004, it would have crashed and burned,'' Lamb told me. ''Because at the end of the day, people hadn't exercised their revenge. They hadn't stood at the edge of the abyss and looked into it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lamb said the time may have arrived for something similar in Afghanistan, if only because everyone is exhausted by so much war. ''Now is a good time,'' he said, ''because people are very serious on all sides.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reconciliation plan might end up bringing into the fold some disreputable characters, but neither Lamb nor McChrystal has much of a problem with that. ''In my view,'' McChrystal said of the insurgents, ''their past is not important. Some people say, 'Well, they have blood on their hands.' I'd say, 'So do a lot of people.' I think we focus on future behavior. They can enter the political process if they want to.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The notion that large groups of Taliban fighters could be persuaded to quit is not new. Previous efforts have ended in failure, often because neither the Americans nor their allies were able to protect people who changed sides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier this year, for example, a local Taliban commander in Wardak Province named Abdul Jameel came forward with a group of fighters and declared that he wanted to quit. Wardak's governor, Halim Fidai, accepted his surrender and told him he was free to go home. Two weeks later, Taliban gunmen entered Jameel's home and killed him, his wife, his uncle, his brother and his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We had nothing to offer him,'' Fidai told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another case, Gulab Mangal, the governor of Helmand Province, told me that during a recent American military operation he got a telephone call from a Taliban commander. ''He wanted to surrender,'' Mangal said. And then the military operation was over -- and the American troops went back to their bases. ''He never called back after that,'' Mangal said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With more American troops, McChrystal told me, he would be better able to squeeze the insurgents into changing sides. ''I think a lot of them need to be convinced that they are not going to be successful,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So many things could scuttle McChrystal's plans: a Taliban more intractable than imagined, the fractured nature of Afghan society and, no matter what President Obama does, a lack of soldiers and time. But there is something even worse, over which neither McChrystal nor his civilian comrades in the American government exercise much control: the government of Hamid Karzai, already among the most corrupt in the world, appears to have secured its large victory in nationwide elections in August by orchestrating the stealing of votes. A United Nations-backed group is trying to sort through the fraud allegations, and American diplomats are trying to broker some sort of power-sharing agreement with Karzai and his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But increasingly, McChrystal, as well as President Obama and the American people, are being forced to confront the possibility that they will be stuck fighting and dying and paying for a government that is widely viewed as illegitimate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I asked McChrystal about this, it was the one issue that he seemed not to have thought through. What if the Afghan people see their own government as illegitimate? How would you fight for something like that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Then we are going to have to avoid looking like we are part of the illegitimacy,'' the general said. ''That is the key thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A GROUP OF American Marines were bumping along a sandy road in their Humvee as the twilight turned to dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One guy lost his legs,'' Sgt. David Spaulding said, riding in the front passenger's seat. ''They were walking in a field.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Humvee bounced along some more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You know the guy who got shot in the head?'' Lance Cpl. Jeremy Dones said, from a seat in the back. ''They got him to Germany. His parents flew to Germany. They took him off life support.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A moment passed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Apparently a guy got blown to pieces, and they can't find all of him,'' Spaulding said. ''They don't know if they have all the pieces.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The men rode together in silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal's plans come to earth along the banks of the Helmand River, where members of the 2/8 Battalion are trying to retake a 20-mile stretch of orchards and villages around the city of Garmsir. The 2/8 Battalion, about 800 men, is part of the 10,000 Marines dispatched to Helmand by President Obama earlier this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since arriving in early July, the 2/8 has lost 13 men, most to homemade bombs. About five times that number have been wounded. The Marines here fight nearly every day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet for all their difficulties, the battalion's progress has been real. Garmsir, a district of about 90,000 people, boasts a functioning government with a governor and a local council. About 300 Afghan soldiers are deployed here, led by an Afghan colonel educated at the United States Army's school for its best junior officers. About 250 Afghan police officers are stationed at bridges and checkpoints. An array of public-works projects is under way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most important, the town of Garmsir and the villages around it are quiet. They are part of an area, roughly six miles wide and six miles long, that has been secured by the Marines along the east bank of the Helmand. They call the area ''the snake's head'' for its oblong shape. Outside of Garmsir, the Taliban roam and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside, life for local Afghans is remarkably sane. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garmsir is a devastated and impoverished place; 30 years of war has seen to that. None of its roads are paved, leaving the farmers unable to sell their grapes and corn in markets outside of town. There are no cellphones, no electricity, no running water. Building a city here that could function on its own would take many years. But in Garmsir's calm, the first hints of normal life are beginning to show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One day in August, I tagged along with a group of Marines to the monthly meeting of Garmsir's district council. Our leader was Capt. Micah Caskey, a civil-affairs officer from Irmo, S.C. At 28, Caskey had already done two tours in the hardest years of the Iraq war. In 2007, he left the Marines to begin a dual graduate degree in law and business at the University of South Carolina. He spent the summer of 2008 studying law abroad. But he stayed in the Marine Reserve, and a few months ago they called him back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I had a job all lined up for the summer,'' Caskey said. ''And now I'm here for seven months. I can't tell you it was easy. Sometimes it really makes me wonder.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garmsir's governor, Abdullah Jan, arrived ahead of the meeting, and he and Caskey and a group of Marines sat in the courtyard of the district headquarters in a circle of plastic chairs. Governor Jan is the beneficiary of Afghanistan's strangely centralized political system; he was appointed by Helmand's governor, Mangal, who was directly appointed by Karzai. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Caskey's experience in Iraq shows immediately. He is unfailingly polite, even deferential, to Jan. And each time one of the councilmen enters, he stops the conversation and rises to shake his hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Peace be upon you,'' Caskey said to Jan. ''It's very nice to see you after so long.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan, who grew up in the district, told Caskey not to worry about local support for the Taliban -- there wasn't any. But in the absence of a stable government, and with no guarantee of safety, ordinary Afghans were often forced to go along. ''I can assure you that the people of Garmsir appreciate what you are doing here,'' Jan said. ''Unfortunately the people are held hostage by the Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Afghan -- one of Jan's assistants -- arrived bearing a tray of tea and cakes while Jan talked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ninety percent of the local people support the government,'' Jan told Caskey. ''Maybe 10 percent really like the Taliban.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That seemed an overstatement; there were too many roadside bombs in the area -- even inside the snake's head. But the point Jan was making seemed valid enough: once there is law and order, public opinion begins to change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You guys,'' Jan said, looking at Caskey and the other Americans, ''you come in, you help and then you leave. The Afghan people are not 100 percent sure that you are going to stay. They are not sure they won't have their throats cut if they tell the Americans where a bomb is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The council's meeting began with its 16 members taking their seats on the floor of a large, airy room. Caskey and the other Americans sat in the back. The agenda for the meeting was to decide on a list of development projects, which the Americans would pay for. As Caskey explained, the Americans didn't want to direct the projects -- they wanted to strengthen the Afghan leaders by funneling the money through them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans are only going to pay for projects that we decide on,'' Jan announced. ''It's up to us.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghans -- all men -- began to talk. Their first choice was unanimous: the main sluice gates that lead to the irrigation canals off the Helmand River, built by American aid workers in the 1950s, were badly in need of repair. Some of the fields were going dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's been 30 years since anyone did any work on that canal,'' Hajji Anwar, one of the councilmen, said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the meeting under way, Caskey and the other Americans got up to leave. ''I have one request,'' Caskey said to one mullah. ''Would you be willing to record a message that we can play over the radio station saying that fighting the government violates the idea of jihad -- that it's not jihad?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan thought for a second and nodded. Caskey and the other Marines strapped on their helmets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''May you have a son just like yourself,'' Jan told him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VIII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE ABANDONED ELEMENTARY school in Mian Poshteh that houses the 240 Marines of 2/8's Echo Company has no bedrooms, no beds, no electricity, no water. It's a vacant, dirty building filled with tired and dirty men. They sleep on the floor, a dozen to a room, or they sleep in the dirt outside, shirtless in the heat. They fight every day. When the Marines don't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Taliban, the Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Marines.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No Americans have ever come this far south before, at least not permanently. With fewer than 8,000 British troops covering all of Helmand, there never were enough to go around. Garmsir is 12 miles up a single dusty road, where Echo Company's supply convoys get bombed nearly every day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mian Poshteh is like Garmsir but worse. There is no government: no mayor, no city council, no police. Thirty Afghan soldiers live here, only 10 of whom leave the base at any given time. As in Garmsir, the Marines in Mian Poshteh have come to build a government -- but they have to defeat the Taliban first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're not going to clear anything that we can't hold onto,'' said Capt. Eric Meador, Echo Company's commander. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even with 240 men, they can't hold onto much. By the time Echo Company and the rest of the 2/8 leave at the end of October, Meador said, he would like to control a perimeter that extends perhaps a mile and a half around his fort. ''I'd be doing pretty well,'' he said. To the south, there isn't another Marine base for miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When you see a place like Mian Poshteh -- wild, broken and isolated -- it's not difficult to see why McChrystal believes he doesn't have enough troops to do what President Obama has asked him to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Echo Company's typical days unfolded in late August, when the Marines set out on foot for a village named Tarakai. Led by a young lieutenant, Patrick Nevins, 24, from Chapel Hill, N.C., Echo Company's First Platoon walked through a vast field of shoulder-high corn. The fields had been flooded recently, so they were filled with muck. The trek might have been easier had the Marines taken the farmers' raised footpaths, but the Taliban had taken to laying land mines in those, so the Marines waded straight into the field itself. The mud below was crisscrossed by gullies and rows of broken ground. The helmets of the Marines bobbed above the top of the corn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fields, deep and green, were eerily empty of other men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I guess all the farmers took the day off,'' Nevins said, hacking his way through the corn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Helmand's summers are long and merciless, and on this day the temperature hovered around 120 degrees. Crossing the fields, with all the muck, it was hotter still. Nevins and his men tromped through the corn in full gear, including helmets and flak jackets. In the heat, my own boots fell apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he walked, Nevins talked a little about himself. He seemed an unlikely presence in the fields of Helmand. His father is a cancer researcher at Duke University. ''My dad is really good at what he does,'' Nevins said, hacking and pushing his way through the mud and corn. ''I guess I didn't want to compete with him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An hour later, Nevins's platoon popped out on the other side. Behind them were trails of toppled corn. ''Sorry about your field,'' Nevins said to an Afghan man standing nearby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's O.K.,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We arrived at Tarakai. A group of Afghans lined up. They were talking about the Afghan presidential election, to be held only a few days later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can't vote,'' said Hakmatullah, who, like many Afghans, has only one name. ''Everybody knows it. We are farmers, and we cannot do a thing against the Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The others said much the same. The Taliban had passed word that they would cut off the right index finger of anyone caught casting a ballot. Not that there was much chance of that: the area around Mian Poshteh was so anarchic that the Afghan government didn't send anyone to register voters. The closest polling place was in Garmsir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there was more to talk about. ''The children are frightened,'' one of the men said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so were the adults. The Taliban owned Tarakai; they taxed the corn and kept watch over the town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When you leave here, the Taliban will come at night and ask us why we were talking to you,'' a villager told Nevins. ''If we cooperate, they would kill us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They will cut out our stomachs,'' another man said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Is there anything I can do for you?'' Nevins asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Don't come close to our houses,'' the first villager said. ''Don't try to negotiate with us.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nevins was polite but insistent. The Americans were here now, and they were going to stay. ''I will try to be respectful, and I will try to keep my distance,'' Nevins told the men. ''But I have a job to do, and I need to be able to come by from time to time.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An old man with a long white beard stepped forward. ''We're afraid you're going to leave this place after a few months,'' the old man said. ''And the Taliban will take their revenge.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I promise you,'' Lieutenant Nevins said, ''we will be here when the weather gets cold, and when it gets hot again.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nevins shook hands with the Afghans and said goodbye. Then he turned, and his men disappeared into the cornfield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN AMERICA, the chorus is insistent and growing: scale back the Afghan mission. It's too hard and too expensive, and we've overstayed our welcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George F. Will, the columnist, recently said as much. So did Rory Stewart, the British scholar-diplomat who has spent years in the region. Vice President Biden is said to favor such a choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The exact shape of a scaled-down commitment is not clear, but it goes something like this: American Special Forces units, aided by Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can keep Al Qaeda off-balance, while American soldiers stay on to train the Afghan Army and the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's an attractive argument, of course: it offers the hope that the United States can achieve the same thing -- American security -- at a much-reduced cost. (The fate of the Afghan people themselves is basically left out of this equation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last month, I visited Richard Haass, one of the idea's chief proponents, at his office in New York, where he is president of the Council on Foreign Relations. (Before that, through June 2003, Haass was director of policy planning at the State Department under President George W. Bush.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Haass is particularly persuasive, in part because he does not pretend to have easy answers. After eight years of mismanagement and neglect, Haass says, every choice the United States faces in Afghanistan is dreadful. The weight of the evidence, he says, suggests that curtailing our ambitions is the option least dreadful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not self-evident that doing more will accomplish more,'' Haass told me. ''And I'm skeptical about how central Afghanistan is anymore to the global effort against terror. I'm not persuaded that you can transform the situation there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bulk of Al Qaeda's leadership, Haass pointed out, is now in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That's where the United States should really be focused -- in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with a population six times larger than Afghanistan's and with at least 60 nuclear warheads. ''No one wants Afghanistan to become a sponge that absorbs a disproportionate share of our country's resources,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal and most of the rest of the Pentagon say that Haass's argument is essentially an illusion. If the United States drew down substantially in Afghanistan, they say, much of the country would quickly be overrun by the Taliban, rendering the other things -- training and counterterrorism -- impossible. Al Qaeda would return, possibly to the place it had before the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks, and Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be likely to follow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I pitched McChrystal's counterargument to Haass, he said he was glad that he wasn't in Obama's shoes. ''Let's not kid ourselves,'' he said. ''We're not going to find some wonderful thing that's going to deliver large positive results at modest costs. It's not going to happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Haass went on to say: ''I keep going back to Yogi Berra. You know: 'When you reach a fork in the road, take it.' I bet there are days when Obama wakes up and sees the fork in the road and decides he's not going to take it. Because both choices are so bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  X.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DURING HIS TRIP to Garmsir, Stanley McChrystal took a moment to meet with Abdullah Jan, the governor. The two sat down in the same council chambers where Jan had met with Captain Caskey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Tell me how we can do better,'' McChrystal said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan thought for a second, then offered an unusual answer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You need to live in a building, not a bunch of tents,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal gave him a quizzical look. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everyone in Garmsir sees that you are living in tents, and they know that you are going to be leaving soon,'' Jan told McChrystal. ''You need to build something permanent -- a building. Because your job here is going to take years. Only then will people be persuaded that you are going to stay.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal nodded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We'll stay as long as we have to until our Afghan partners are completely secure,'' he said. ''Even if that means years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal started to get up, but Jan wasn't finished yet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Afghan people are impatient,'' he said. ''We've been waiting for 30 years! We don't want to wait any longer. We're impatient!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McChrystal held back a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Believe me,'' he told Jan. ''I work for a lot of impatient people, too.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A  YOUNG Taliban driver with shoulder-length hair got behind the wheel of the car. Glancing at me suspiciously in the rearview mirror, he started the engine and began driving down the left-hand side of the road. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was some sort of prank, I hoped, some jihadi version of chicken -- the game where two drivers speed toward each other in the same lane until one loses his nerve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which lane he drove down showed what country we were in. If he continued driving on the left, we had crossed into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. If he drove on the right, we were still in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A mile down the road, traffic signs appeared in Urdu. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I thought to myself. We're dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eight days earlier, a Taliban faction had kidnapped me along with an Afghan journalist, Tahir Luddin, and our driver, Asad Mangal, during a reporting trip just outside Kabul. The faction's commander, a man who called himself Atiqullah, had lied to us. He had said we were being moved to southern Afghanistan and would be freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, on Nov. 18, we arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, an isolated belt of Taliban-controlled territory. We were now in ''the Islamic emirate'' -- the fundamentalist state that existed in Afghanistan before the 2001 American-led invasion. The loss of thousands of Afghan, Pakistani and American lives and billions in American aid had merely moved it a few miles east, not eliminated it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Through seven years of reporting in the region, I had pitied captives imprisoned here. It was arguably the worst place on earth to be an American hostage. The United States government had virtually no influence and was utterly despised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since 2004, dozens of missiles fired by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had killed hundreds of militants and civilians. The Taliban had held Afghan, Pakistani and foreign hostages in the area for years, trading lives for ransom and executions for publicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' I said out loud in the car, venting my anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah laughed, and the driver appeared surprised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''How does he know it's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?'' the driver asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because you're driving down the left-hand side of the road,'' I answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''How do you know that?'' he asked. ''When were you in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah smiled and appeared amused by the conversation. He knew I had been to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many times on reporting trips. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was one of dozens of journalists who had written articles detailing how Al Qaeda and the Taliban had turned the tribal areas into their new stronghold after being driven from Afghanistan in 2001. I had watched the Pakistani government, then led by President Pervez Musharraf, largely stand by as the Taliban murdered tribal elders and seized control of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, an abstract foreign policy issue was deeply personal. When my wife and family learned that I was in the tribal areas, their distress would increase exponentially. They would expect that I would never return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We arrived in a large town, and I spotted a sign that said ''Wana'' in English. Wana is the capital of South Waziristan, the most radical area of the seven administrative districts that make up the tribal areas. We stopped in the main bazaar, and I was left alone in the car with the young driver. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Desperate rationalizations swirled through my mind. Our captors wanted a ransom and prisoners. Killing us got them nothing. The three of us would survive. They were all delusions, of course. Simply getting us this far was an enormous victory for them. We would be held here for months or killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the car, dozens of Pakistani tribesmen and Afghan and foreign militants milled around. Each carried a Kalashnikov assault rifle on his shoulder and had a long, thick beard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man with a large turban stopped, peered at me in the back seat and asked the driver a question in Pashto. The driver looked at me and said a sentence that I thought included the word for martyr. I told myself the driver had said I was on my way to heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah got back into the car, and I felt relief. He had kidnapped us, but more and more I desperately viewed Atiqullah as my protector, the man who would continue to treat us well as other militants called for our heads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OUR first Pakistani home was in Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan. Two large sleeping rooms looked out on a small courtyard. One even had a small washroom, separate from the toilet, for showering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the first day there, I went to the bathroom and returned to find Tahir with a fresh cut on his calf. It looked as if someone had drawn a line across his leg in red ink. A local Waziri militant had taken out his knife and tried to cut off a chunk of Tahir's calf, saying he wanted to eat the flesh of an Afghan who worked with Westerners. One of Atiqullah's guards had stopped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All day, a parade of random Pakistani militants stopped by the house to stare at us. I felt like an animal in a zoo. Among them was a local Taliban commander who introduced himself as Badruddin. He was the brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who led the Haqqani network, one of the most powerful Taliban factions in the region. Miram Shah was its stronghold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their father was Jalaluddin Haqqani, an Afghan mujahedeen leader whom the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backed in the 1980s when he battled the Soviets. In the 1990s, the United States ended its relationship with the Haqqanis and many other hard-line Afghan fighters. With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> help, the Taliban movement emerged and the Haqqanis joined them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Badruddin, a tall, talkative man who appeared to be in his early 30s, said he was preparing to make a video of us to release to the media. He smiled as he showed me a video on his camera of a French aid worker, Dany Egreteau,  who had been kidnapped a week before us as he walked to his office in Kabul. He was in chains and appeared to have welts on his face. He implored his family and friends to save him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a nightmare,'' he said.  ''I really beg you to pay.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked if Tahir and I could speak alone with Atiqullah, and I told him we should not make the video. The American and Afghan governments were more likely to agree to a secret prisoner exchange, I said, than a public one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trying to reduce their expectations, I told him it would be far easier to get prisoners from the main Afghan-run prison outside Kabul, known as Pul-i-Charkhi.  If the Taliban demanded prisoners from the American-run detention centers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Bagram, Afghanistan, they would never succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was not worth that much, I told him, and he should compromise. I did not say it, but I also wanted to spare my family the pain of seeing me in a video. To my surprise, Atiqullah agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am one of those kinds of people,'' he said at one point. ''I am one of those people who like to meet in the middle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir, Asad and I would be allowed to call our families that night to prove we were alive, he said. Atiqullah told me to emphasize during the call that he wanted to reach a deal quickly. He continued to cover his face with a scarf. To me, that meant he did not want to be identified because he planned to release us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I spent the rest of the day nervously scribbling a list of things I wanted to say to my wife, Kristen, whom I had married just two months earlier. I added items and then crossed them out. I wanted to ease my family's fears that I was being tortured, but I also wanted to do everything possible to free the three of us. I wasn't sure I would have another chance to speak with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LATE that night, Atiqullah and Badruddin drove us out of town. Atiqullah stopped the car in a dry riverbed and turned off the engine. He left the headlights on, and we used them to see the number pad on a small satellite phone. Atiqullah and Badruddin ordered me to tell Kristen that we were being held in terrible conditions in the mountains of Afghanistan. I dialed my wife's number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Hello?'' she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kristen?'' I said. ''Kristen?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''David,'' she said, ''it's Kristen. I love you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She sounded calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kristen?'' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes?'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I love you, too,'' I said. ''Write these things down, O.K.?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''O.K.,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She sounded remarkably composed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm, we are being treated well,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Being treated well,'' Kristen repeated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No. 1,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Uh-huh, No. 1,'' Kristen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No. 2,'' I said. ''Deal for all three of us, all three of us, not just me. The driver and the translator also; it has to be a deal for all three of us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Deal for all three of us,'' she repeated. ''The driver and the translator as well. O.K.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Do not use force to try to get us,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Do not use force,'' Kristen repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Four,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes,'' Kristen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Make a deal now or they will make it public,'' I said. ''They want to put a video out to the media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kristen repeated my words back to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will make it a big political problem,'' I said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah told me to tell her that this was my last call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They said I can't call you again,'' I said. ''They want a deal now and I can't call you again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You cannot call me again,'' she repeated. ''I love you. I love you, honey.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I love you, too,'' I said. ''Tell my family I'm sorry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Your family is here, Lee's here with me,'' she said, referring to my older brother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm sorry,'' I said, ''I'm sorry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's going to be all right,'' Kristen said calmly. ''I love you. I am praying for you every day.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kristen said she wanted to make sure she understood what the Taliban wanted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What is the deal?'' she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah told me to tell her that he would call The New York Times's Kabul bureau with demands. ''We are very concerned about you,'' Kristen said. ''And we love you, and we're praying for you.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The satellite phone beeped and abruptly went dead. Kristen was gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  STANDING in the remote darkness of Waziristan at the mercy of Taliban militants, I felt at peace. I had spoken to my wife for the first time in nine days. I had expected panic or tears, but she sounded collected and confident. Her words ''It's going to be all right'' would linger in my mind for months. Her composure would sustain me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah and Badruddin then told me to call The Times's bureau in Kabul. But instead of ordering me to make specific demands, they instructed all three of us to exaggerate our suffering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are in terrible conditions, Tahir is very sick,'' I told Chris Chivers, a close friend and Times reporter, who answered the phone. I was ordered to tell Chris that Atiqullah was not with us -- even though he was, in fact, standing beside me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir then spoke to Chris and asked him to tell his family he was alive and in good health. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They keep telling me that if things go wrong they will repeat the story of Helmand,'' Tahir said, ''so I am just afraid they are going to kill me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir was referring to the 2007 kidnapping of an Italian journalist in Helmand Province that ended in the beheadings of an Afghan journalist and a driver working with him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asad then spoke with an Afghan reporter in the bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am fine, I am O.K.,'' he said. ''Tell my family that we are in the mountains but we are O.K.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conversation dragged on, with Atiqullah continuing to direct me about what to say. When he ordered me to tell Chris that they would kill the driver and translator first, I refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kill me first,'' I told Atiqullah, ''Kill me first.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chris overheard me and interrupted. ''Nobody needs that, David,'' he said. ''Nobody needs to die.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are threatening to kill the driver and the translator,'' I explained to Chris. ''I have to tell you, I have to tell you. I don't want to tell you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We understand that they are making those threats,'' Chris said, ''but that will not make our job easier.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chris said that if the Taliban killed anyone it would make government officials angry and make any deal even more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Please don't let them kill the driver and the translator,'' I said. ''Please don't let them kill the driver and translator.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am sorry about this,'' I added. ''I apologize to everyone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''David, this is not your fault,'' Chris said. He urged me to tell Atiqullah to keep calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''O.K., all three of us, Chris,'' I said as Badruddin and Atiqullah ordered me to end the call. ''It's gotta be all three of us. I gotta go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS Atiqullah drove us back into Miram Shah, I felt relief. Kristen had sounded calm. Chris had said The Times was doing all it could. I felt I had fought for Tahir and Asad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We arrived at a new house, and I was again surprised by the good conditions. It had regular electricity, and we could wash ourselves with buckets of warm water. I received a new set of clothes, a toothbrush, toothpaste and shampoo. Guards allowed us to walk in a yard, and the weather was surprisingly warm. We received pomegranates and other fresh food and Nestle Pure Life water bottled in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tribal areas were more developed and the Taliban more sophisticated than I expected. They browsed the Internet and listened to hourly news updates on Azadi Radio, a station run by the American government. But then they dismissed whatever information did not meet their preconceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atiqullah said he needed to return to Afghanistan, but two of his men stayed behind to guard us. ''I will return in 7 to 10 days,'' he promised, then disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That week, to help us pass the time, we received a shortwave radio and a board game called checkah, a Pakistani variation of Parcheesi. To my amazement, the guards even brought me English-language Pakistani newspapers. Delivered to a shop in Miram Shah, the newspapers were only a day or two old. Instead of beating us as I expected, our captors were at least trying to meet some of our needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as in so much of our seven months in captivity, reasons for optimism would be overtaken by harsh realities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the next several nights, a stream of Haqqani commanders overflowing with hatred for the United States and Israel visited us, unleashing blistering critiques that would continue throughout our captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of their comments were factual. They said large numbers of civilians had been killed in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Palestinian territories in aerial bombings. Muslim prisoners had been physically abused and sexually humiliated in Iraq. Scores of men had been detained in Cuba and Afghanistan for up to seven years without charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Americans, these episodes were aberrations. To my captors, they were proof that the United States was a hypocritical and duplicitous power that flouted international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I told them I was an innocent civilian who should be released, they responded that the United States had held and tortured Muslims in secret detention centers for years. Commanders said they themselves had been imprisoned, their families ignorant of their fate. Why, they asked, should they treat me differently? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other accusations were paranoid and delusional. Seven years after 9/11, they continued to insist that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were hatched by American and Israeli intelligence agencies to create a pretext for the United States to enslave the Muslim world. They said the United States was forcibly converting vast numbers of Muslims to Christianity. American and NATO soldiers, they believed, were making Afghan women work as prostitutes on military bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their hatred for the United States seemed boundless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TEN days passed, but Atiqullah did not return as promised. Badruddin now seemed to be in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He moved us to a far smaller, dirtier house. The space we were allowed to walk in was the width of a city sidewalk and ringed by high walls. The food was unclean and made me sick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our first night there, the Taliban commander who owned the house promised to update us every three days on negotiations for our release. But we would not see him again for months. The guards stopped taking Tahir to a local doctor for digestive and skin ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it was increasingly clear that Tahir and Asad would be separated from their families for Id al-Adha -- a major Muslim holiday that marks Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to show his devotion to God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alarmed by the worsening treatment, Tahir and I began a hunger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in early December. At first, the guards panicked and begged us to eat. We refused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After two days, the guards said Atiqullah had called and told them that a deal for our release was nearly complete. He said he was waiting for approval from President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who was on a foreign trip. The French aid worker in the video I was shown had been released, they said. We would be next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fearing that our continued defiance would anger our captors and scuttle the deal, we began eating again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead of releasing us, Badruddin moved us to yet another house. It was larger than the previous one but felt more like a prison. Twenty-foot-high concrete walls surrounded a small courtyard where I spent my days walking in circles. For the first time in my life, I began praying several times a day, and I found that it centered me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We started preparing our own meals. The food was cleaner and fresher, but cooking for ourselves gave a worrying sense of permanence to our imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Badruddin visited us several days later and promised that negotiations were continuing. But he was increasingly casual. Any sense of urgency about our release seemed to be fading. Before leaving, he told me the Taliban would not kill me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You are the golden hen,'' he said, clearly expecting me to lay a golden egg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked him to promise not to kill Tahir and Asad. Speaking directly to me in broken English, he said the Taliban had decided to kill Asad if their demands were not met in a week. After he left, Tahir and I decided not to tell Asad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I panicked over the next two days, frantically trying to think of ways to save our young driver. Since the three of us had arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Nov. 18, I had spent hours each day talking politics, religion and survival with Tahir, but I could barely communicate with Asad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I spoke little Pashto, he spoke little English. I came up with a routine when a newspaper arrived. I showed Asad photos and tried to explain what they were about. He laughed, but I felt like a monster. Asad was an impoverished, hard-working father of two -- and I was going to get him killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the third day after Badruddin's visit, I told one of our guards that I was willing to make a video -- or do anything they wanted -- to save Asad. The guard said he would check with Badruddin. The following day, the guard announced that it had all been a misunderstanding. There was no deadline to kill Asad. I didn't know what the truth was but felt enormous relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several days later, Badruddin arrived to make the video. He promised us that it would go only to our families, but what he instructed us to say made me think it would be released publicly. As guards pointed assault rifles at our heads, I called for President Bush and President-elect Obama to meet the Taliban's demands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you don't meet their demands,'' I said, ''they will kill all of us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir and Asad then made similar statements. Badruddin departed, and I told myself that our families would at least know we were alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As December dragged on, tensions in the house steadily grew. Qari, the guard who had nearly shot Tahir, tore the checkah board to shreds after he repeatedly lost. Then, Tahir and Asad ripped up two other checkah boards out of frustration as well. Qari began spending hours alone reciting the Koran and seemed increasingly distant and unstable. I worried that the situation was slowly spinning out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SEVERAL days before Christmas, Atiqullah finally returned. He announced that he had spectacular news. ''We are here to free you,'' he said, wearing no scarf over his face for the first time. ''We have come here to release you.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first, I was euphoric. My confidence in Atiqullah had not been misplaced. Here was a more moderate and reasonable Taliban leader who would persevere and release us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, later that night, the conversation turned menacing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American military had mounted an operation to arrest Abu Tayyeb on the morning that we were to interview him, Atiqullah said, referring to the Taliban leader we had been traveling to meet when we were kidnapped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shocked, I told Atiqullah I knew nothing about a military operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I had sent text messages from my cellphone to Saudi Arabia before the interview, Atiqullah claimed, to tip off the American military about Abu Tayyeb's location. Again, I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, he announced that I was a spy, along with other employees of The Times in Afghanistan. His men had prepared a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the paper's Kabul bureau, he said, which he could set off with a single phone call. His men had nearly kidnapped Carlotta Gall, our bureau chief, but she had left an interview just before they arrived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She was probably given information,'' he said, seemingly convinced that all journalists were intelligence operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our imprisonment, I thought, had reached a low point. My colleagues in Kabul were now in danger. Atiqullah's talk of our imminent release seemed farcical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The following morning, Atiqullah insisted that there was, in fact, a deal. At one point, he said we would be exchanged within ''days.'' He toyed with me, asking which flights I would take back to the United States and how many television cameras would be at the airport. He asked me what I would say to my wife when I saw her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By this point, I began to doubt everything he said. Then I learned that he had lied to us from the beginning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In conversations when our guards left the room, Tahir and Asad each separately whispered to me that Atiqullah was, in fact, Abu Tayyeb. They had known since the day we were kidnapped, they said, but dared not tell me. They asked me to stay silent as well. Abu Tayyeb had vowed to behead them if they revealed his true identity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Tayyeb had invited us to an interview, betrayed us and then pretended that he was a commander named Atiqullah. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was despondent and left with only one certainty: We had no savior among the Taliban. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NERVOUS-LOOKING Pakistani soldier pointed a rocket-propelled grenade at our pickup truck in late January. The Taliban guard beside me loaded his rifle and ordered me to put a scarf over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  my face. A group of Pakistani civilians standing nearby moved out of the way, anticipating a firefight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the driver's seat of our vehicle was Badruddin Haqqani, a senior commander of the Haqqani network, one of the Taliban's most hard-line factions and the group that was holding me and two Afghan colleagues hostage in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obeying the guard, I covered my face. The soldier was in the lead vehicle of a Pakistani Army supply convoy in North Waziristan. After surveying the road, the soldier got back in his truck, and the convoy rumbled forward. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I hoped that the Pakistanis might somehow rescue us. Instead, I watched in dismay as Badruddin got out of the truck and calmly stood on the side of the road. As trucks full of heavily armed government soldiers rolled by, he smiled and waved at them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the convoy disappeared, Badruddin seemed amused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Do you know who that was?'' he asked me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No,'' I said, trying to play dumb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That was the Pakistani Army,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He explained that under a cease-fire agreement between the Taliban and the army, all civilians were required to get out of their cars when an army convoy approached. For Taliban vehicles, though, only the driver had to get out. The practice, I realized, allowed the Taliban to hide kidnapping victims and foreign militants from the Pakistani Army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That morning, Badruddin arrived at the house in Miram Shah where I was being held with Tahir Luddin, an Afghan journalist, and Asad Mangal, our driver. We had been taken hostage on a reporting trip south of Kabul, Afghanistan, in November 2008 and moved to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Badruddin announced that he was taking us out of town to a snow-covered hillside to shoot the final scene of a video that would be released to the news media. He was determined to make it look as though we were being held in the frigid mountains of Afghanistan, not in a bustling city in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As we continued our journey, we passed a half-dozen checkpoints that had been abandoned by the Frontier Corps, a militia that had been the Pakistani government's primary security force in the tribal areas until 2001. Badruddin said that under the cease-fire agreement, only unarmed militia members could stand at the checkpoints. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As we drove, I occasionally saw members of the militia standing on the side of the road without guns. Some casually chatted with local tribesmen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trip confirmed suspicions I had harbored for years as a reporter.  The Haqqanis oversaw a sprawling Taliban mini-state in the tribal areas with the de facto acquiescence of the Pakistani military. The Haqqanis were so confident of their control of the area that they took me -- a person they considered to be an extraordinarily valuable hostage -- on a three-hour drive in broad daylight to shoot a scene for a video outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout North Waziristan, Taliban policemen patrolled the streets, and Taliban road crews carried out construction projects. The Haqqani network's commanders and foreign militants freely strolled the bazaars of Miram Shah and other towns. Young Afghan and Pakistani Taliban members revered the foreign fighters, who taught them how to make bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the winter, I would come to know the reality the Haqqanis had created. Some nights, commanders and their fighters visited the houses where we were being held. Conversations were dominated by their unwavering belief that the United States was waging a war against Islam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a universe filled with contradictions. My captors assailed the West for killing civilians, but they celebrated suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> orchestrated by the Taliban that killed scores of Muslim bystanders. They bitterly denounced missionaries, but they pressed me to convert to their faith.  They complained about innocent Muslims being imprisoned by the United States, even as they continued to hold us captive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet in our day to day existence, when commanders were absent, some of our guards showed glimpses of humanity. Those moments gave us hope that we might somehow be able to talk or reason our way out of captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN early February, our guards told us that Badruddin  had sent the video to Afghan and foreign media outlets but that only Al Jazeera had broadcast it. The news frustrated Tahir and Asad, who had hoped that the video would be widely broadcast and stimulate negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was not surprised. I had heard before our abduction that the Afghan and foreign news media had struck an informal agreement not to publicize the kidnappings of journalists in Afghanistan if their organization requested it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The October 2008 kidnapping of a Canadian journalist in Kabul, Melissa Fung, had been kept quiet. Keeping the kidnappings out of the news, it was hoped, would decrease the expectations of hostage-takers that they could garner vast amounts of publicity or ransom for journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After news outlets declined to show the video, we asked our guards to call Abu Tayyeb, the Taliban commander who had abducted us outside Kabul and concealed his identity. He agreed to return to Miram Shah and said he would try to negotiate a ransom with my family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir, Asad and I had received comforting letters from our families through the International Committee of the Red Cross. But I hadn't spoken to my wife, Kristen, in three months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, on Feb. 16, Abu Tayyeb drove me to a remote location and allowed me to call her. The Taliban told me to give her the number of their cellphone and have her call us back. They were demanding $7 million at that point but were too cheap to pay for the phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is my last call,'' I said to her, repeating what they had told me to say. ''This is our last chance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Tayyeb promised that he would reach a settlement with my family. Then, as he had many times before, he left without doing so. My conversations with him during his brief visit left me doubtful that he would ever compromise in a case involving an American. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One morning, he wept at news that a NATO airstrike had killed women and children in southern Afghanistan. A guard explained to me that Abu Tayyeb reviled the United States because of the civilian deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One evening, Abu Tayyeb declared that the Taliban treated women better than Americans did. He said women in the United States were forced to wear revealing clothes and define themselves solely as sex objects. The Taliban protected women's honor by not allowing them to appear in public with their faces unveiled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My captors saw me -- and seemingly all Westerners -- as morally corrupt and fixated on pursuing the pleasures of this world.  Americans invaded Afghanistan to enrich themselves, they argued, not to help Afghans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They ignored the fact that the United States helped build hundreds of miles of paved roads in Afghanistan and more than a thousand schools and health clinics. My captors denied widespread news reports that the Taliban burned down scores of newly built schools to prevent girls from getting an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I argued that the United States was not the menacing, predatory caricature that they believed. I also tried to counter their belief that all Americans were astonishingly rich. Nothing I said, though, seemed to change their minds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One day, I received a copy of Dawn, an English-language Pakistani newspaper, that featured an article on the perilous financial state of The New York Times. I saved the newspaper until commanders stopped by for visits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Showing them the headline ''New York Times Struggles to Stay Afloat,'' I explained that the American newspaper industry -- as well as the American economy -- was in a free fall. They listened to what I said and nodded. Then, they ignored me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WE were held for much of the winter in a building the Pakistani government had constructed to serve as a health clinic. It was part of an American-backed effort to win the hearts and minds  of the local population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our guards spent their days there listening to radio broadcasts and shouting ''God is great!'' at reports of the deaths of Afghan and American soldiers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of the guards were Afghan men in their late 20s and early 30s. Some had grown up as refugees in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. All had limited educations from government schools or religious institutions, known as madrasas. Some did not make it past junior high school. None had seen the world beyond Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They all had relatives or friends who had been killed by Soviet or American troops. They grew up in a culture where teenage boys reached manhood and made a name for themselves by showing their bravery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I tried to get to know one of the guards, who was preparing to be a suicide bomber. A young man in his 20s with a slim build and brown eyes, he said he had studied engineering in high school. He never attended college but was relatively well educated compared with the other fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I asked him why he wanted to die, he replied that living in this world was a burden for any true Muslim. Heaven was his goal, he said. Earthly relationships with his parents and siblings did not matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke a smattering of English, and my own beliefs seemed to interest and amaze him. During our six weeks together, he asked me a series of questions. Was it true, he asked, that a necktie was a secret symbol of Christianity? Was it true that Christians wanted to live 1,000 years? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the weeks passed, our captivity became increasingly surreal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My Taliban guards slept beneath bedspreads manufactured  by a Pakistani textile company and emblazoned with characters from the American television show ''Hannah Montana'' and the movie ''Spider-Man.'' My blanket was a pink Barbie comforter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My captors railed against the evils of a secular society. In March, they celebrated a suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a mosque in the Pakistani town of Jamrud that killed as many as 50 worshipers as they prayed to God. Those living under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apostate government, they said, deserved it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One commander declared that no true Muslim could live in a state where Islam was not the official religion. He flatly rejected my compromise suggestion that strict Islamic law be enacted in Afghanistan's conservative rural south, while milder forms of Islam be followed in the comparatively liberal north. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Citing the Taliban's interpretation of Islam, he said it was every Muslim's duty to try to stop others from sinning. If one person in a village commits a sin, those who witness it and do not stop him will also be punished by God. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After we had been held for months in captivity, my kidnappers demanded that I stop washing the group's dishes because they did not want to catch my diseases. They believed that problems I was having with my stomach stemmed from my being an inherently unclean non-Muslim, not from unhygienic water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their rigidity was the opposite of the tolerant attitudes I had found among the vast majority of Muslims I had met  in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pressing me to convert, one commander ordered me to read a passage of the Koran each day and discuss it with him at night. He dismissed my arguments that a forced conversion was not legitimate. He and the guards politely said they felt sorry for me. If I failed to convert, they said, I would suffer excruciating pain in the fires of hell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one point,  a visiting fighter demanded to know why I would not obey. He said that if it were up to him, he would take me outside and offer me a final chance to convert. If I refused, he would shoot me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I realized that he and other fighters might be exaggerating their views to frighten me. The virulence I saw among the Haqqani foot soldiers was not as monolithic as it sometimes seemed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One young fighter showed a different side. He refused to carry out a commander's order to kidnap a foreigner working in Afghanistan. During one visit, he suggested that I read a passage in an English-language Koran to comfort myself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope,'' it said. ''For it is only that which it hath earned, and against it only that which it hath deserved. Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on us, Thou, our Protector, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DURING our months in Miram Shah, patterns emerged. When certain commanders visited, the atmosphere was tense, and discussions centered on what they saw as  Western injustices against Muslims.  When we were alone with the guards who lived with us, moments of levity emerged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They searched for ways to break the monotony.  After dinner on many winter nights, my guards sang Pashto songs for hours. My voice and Pashto pronunciation were terrible, but our guards urged me to sing along. The ballads varied. On some evenings, I found myself reluctantly singing Taliban songs that declared that ''you have atomic bombs, but we have suicide bombers.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On other nights, at my guards' urging, I switched to American tunes. In a halting, off-key voice, I sang Frank Sinatra's version of ''New York, New York'' and described it as the story of a villager who tries to succeed in the city and support his family. I sang Bruce Springsteen's ''Born to Run'' and described it as a portrayal of the struggles of average Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I realized that my guards, too, might have needed a break from our grim existence. But I felt like a performing monkey when they told me to sing for visiting commanders. I knew they were simply  laughing at me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I intentionally avoided American love songs, trying to dispel their belief that all Americans were hedonists. Despite my efforts, romantic songs -- whatever their language -- were the guards' favorites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Beatles song ''She Loves You,'' which popped into my head soon after I received my wife's letter from the Red Cross, was the most popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For reasons that baffled me, the guards relished singing it with me. I began by singing its first verse. My three Taliban guards, along with Tahir and Asad, then joined me in the chorus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She loves you -- yeah, yeah, yeah,'' we sang, with Kalashnikovs lying on the floor around us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Held by the Taliban: This is the third in a series of five articles that offer a first-person account by David Rohde of his seven months as a captive of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO deafening explosions shook the walls of the compound where the Taliban held us hostage. My guards and I dived to the floor as chunks of dirt hurtled through the window. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Dawood?'' one guard shouted, saying my name in Arabic. ''Dawood?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm O.K.,'' I replied in Pashto. ''I'm O.K.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plastic sheeting covering the window hung in tatters. Debris covered the floor. Somewhere outside, a woman wailed. I wondered if Tahir Luddin and Asad Mangal, the two Afghans who had been kidnapped with me, were alive. A guard grabbed his rifle and ordered me to follow him outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Go!'' he shouted, his voice shaking with fury. ''Go!''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our nightmare  had come to pass. Powerful missiles fired by an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had obliterated their target a few hundred yards from our house in  a remote village in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dozens of people were probably dead. Militants would call for our heads in revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside, shredded tree leaves littered the yard, but the house and its exterior walls remained intact. Tahir and Asad looked worried. No one was hurt, but I knew the three of us might not survive for long. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was March 25, and for months the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been a terrifying presence. Remotely piloted, propeller-driven airplanes, they could easily be heard as they circled overhead for hours. To the naked eye, they were small dots in the sky. But their missiles had a range of several miles. We knew we could be immolated without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our guards believed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were targeting me. United States officials wanted to kill me, they said, because my death would eliminate the enormous leverage and credibility they believed a single American prisoner gave the Haqqanis, the Taliban faction that was holding us. Whenever a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared, I was ordered to stay inside. The guards believed that its surveillance cameras could recognize my face from thousands of feet above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the courtyard after the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the guards clutched their weapons and anxiously watched the sky. Fearing a direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on our house, they ordered me to cover my face with a scarf and follow them outside the compound. I knew that enraged Arab militants or local tribesmen could spot me once I was outside, but I had no choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They hustled me down a hillside to where a station wagon was parked between rows of trees. Opening the rear door, they ordered me to lie  inside and keep the scarf on so passers-by could not see my face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I lay in the back of the car and silently recited the Lord's Prayer. In the distance, I heard men shouting as they collected their dead. If many people had been killed, particularly women and children, we were sure to die. For months, I had promised myself that if they taped our execution I would remain calm for my family and declare our innocence until the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After about 15 minutes,  the guards returned to the car and led me back to the house. The missiles had struck two cars, killing a total of seven Arab militants and local Taliban fighters. I felt a small measure of relief that no civilians had been killed. But I knew we were still in grave danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two weeks earlier our captors had moved us from Miram Shah, the capital of the North Waziristan tribal agency, to a remote town in South Waziristan. I had seen on a receipt from a local shop that we were in Makeen, a stronghold of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud.  The region teemed with Uzbek, Arab, Afghan and Pakistani militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the next two hours, I did my best to placate the guards. I did not walk in the yard. I did not speak unless spoken to. I praised God for saving us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, I learned that one guard called for me to be taken to the site of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and ritually beheaded as a video camera captured the moment. The chief guard overruled him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban assailed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and my captors expressed more hatred for President Obama than for President Bush. They bitterly criticized the Obama administration for increasing the missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas and the number of American troops  in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A stalemate between the United States and the Taliban seemed to unfold before me. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed many senior commanders and hindered their operations. Yet the Taliban were able to garner recruits in their aftermath by exaggerating the number of civilian casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also created a paranoia among the Taliban. They believed that a network of local informants guided the missiles. Innocent civilians were rounded up, accused of working as American spies and then executed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several days after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near our house in Makeen, we heard that foreign militants had arrested a local man. He confessed to being a spy after they disemboweled him and chopped off his leg. Then they decapitated him and hung his body in the local bazaar as a warning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE house in Makeen was the crudest we had inhabited in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Perched on a hilltop, it had no running water, fleas and  a courtyard littered with trash.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Makeen was  colder than Miram Shah, and frequent rain and frigid temperatures created miserable conditions. Hailstorms were common and viewed as punishment from God by our captors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was given daily chores by guards who were half my age. The tasks were demeaning, since elders are treated with reverence in Pashtun culture, but I did not care. The chores helped me pass the time and appeared to give the guards the sense I was loyal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Twice a day, I filled a barrel in the bathroom with water,  which we used to flush the toilet, and methodically swept the dirt floors. It was a Sisyphean task, but cleaning gave me the illusion of control when in reality I had none. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rarely  allowed outside the house, I saw my world shrink to a few dozen square feet. My daily focus simply became survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tahir struggled as well, telling me at times that he could no longer remember the faces of his seven children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is not life,'' he said. ''I want to die.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With each passing month, we felt increasingly forgotten and at the mercy of the young guards who lived with us. The chief guard was the younger brother of Abu Tayyeb, the Taliban commander who had abducted Tahir, Asad and me in November after inviting us to interview him outside Kabul, Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He began pocketing some of the money given to him to buy our food and supplies. He dared us to try to escape so he could end our captivity with ''one bullet.'' He complained that  mujahedeen were dying in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yet enormous attention was being wasted on one American prisoner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I showed him several dozen flea bites on my stomach and arms, he bought a pesticide and suggested that I put it on my sleeping bag. Fearing it would make me sick, I declined. When the bites continued, I showed another guard. His response was to show me his own stomach, which had no bites on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I never get sick while I'm on jihad,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After long conversations between Tahir and me prompted the guards to accuse us of planning an escape, we spoke less. Some days, we talked only a few minutes. Increasingly, I became lost in my own thoughts, and my memories of the world I had known began to fade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trying to stay connected, I listened to the BBC's shortwave radio broadcasts for hours at a time. The news broadcasts raised my spirits, but they also gave me the sensation of being in a coma. I could hear how the world was progressing but could not communicate with anyone in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE video image was grainy but I immediately recognized the hostage's face. ''Hello, Peter,'' an off-camera questioner said. ''How are you?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Fine,'' answered Piotr Stanczak, a soft-spoken 42-year-old Polish geologist kidnapped by the Taliban in September 2008. Two masked militants holding assault rifles stood on either side of him. A black sheet with jihadi slogans hung on the mud-brick wall behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In mid-March, one of our guards arrived with a DVD player. After that, watching jihadi videos became the guards' favorite pastime. Playing along with his captors in the video, Stanczak called for the Polish government to stop sending troops to Muslim countries and to break relations with the Pakistani government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I had never met Stanczak but had read about his ordeal in Pakistani newspapers. When I realized the video would end in his beheading, I stood up to leave. I did not want to watch it -- or give the guards the satisfaction of seeing me watch it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  '' 'I would say people of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very good, people is very good,' '' I heard Stanczak say as I walked out of the room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The videos were impossible to avoid at night, when I was confined to the room  the guards were in.  They were little more than grimly repetitive snuff films. The Taliban executed local men who had been declared American spies. Taliban roadside bombs blew up Afghan government trucks and American Humvees. The most popular videos documented the final days of suicide bombers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As I silently watched, the guards repeatedly asked me what I thought of seeing American soldiers killed on the screen in front of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All killing is wrong,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The guards would watch for hours at a time. Over all, the videos created an alternate, pro-Taliban narrative of the war in Afghanistan. A recurring theme was that the United States and NATO underreported the number of foreign troops dying in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The videos were not limited to the conflict in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Images of dead Palestinian, Kashmiri  and Iraqi civilians delivered the message that vast numbers of Muslims were being slaughtered across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The constant images of death seemed to be cynical efforts by Taliban commanders to numb their young foot soldiers to the prospect of sacrificing their lives. Death, the message went, was not a distant fate. Instead, it was a friendly companion and a goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The guards knew little of the outside world and had limited education. They shared a book  that  glorified martyrdom, promising  saccharine fruit juices, sumptuous food and 70 virgins in heaven. One of the guards read haltingly, pronouncing each word out loud as if he were an elementary school student. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I feared that the videos were brainwashing our driver, Asad. After we moved to Makeen, he seemed more friendly toward the guards and began carrying a Kalashnikov they had given him. He also stopped smoking, which the guards said was forbidden under Islam. He was only doing what he needed to do to stay alive, I told myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN late April, a surprise visit by Abu Tayyeb, the commander who had kidnapped us,  raised our hopes that our freedom was being negotiated. Dressed in an expensive white tunic, he strode into our compound just before dinner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Dawood,'' he asked, ''what would you say if I told you that you could start your journey back to New York tomorrow?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That would make me incredibly happy,'' I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He told me to get a notebook and pen and ordered everyone to leave the room except for his deputy commander, Tahir and me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Your family has been very slow,'' he said. ''Write this down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is my proof-of-life video,'' he dictated. ''Maybe another video will come that will be very bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He paused and tried to think of his next line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If this message does not help,'' he said. ''I cannot say what will happen to me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I quickly realized that Abu Tayyeb had not shown up to complete  a deal. His visit was another effort to extort money from my family. Five months into our captivity, he had refused to lower his demands below a $5 million ransom as well as an exchange of prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calmly sitting across the room from me, he dictated more lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you don't help me, I will die,'' he said. ''Now the key is in your hand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He paused again for a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Please save me, I want to go home,'' he said. ''Don't you want me to stay alive with you? Hurry up. Hurry up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then he told me I would need to cry for the video. I stared at Tahir. If I refused, the Taliban might kill him or Asad to drive up a potential ransom payment. I hated the thought of my wife, Kristen, and my family seeing such a video, but Tahir was the father of seven children, and Asad the father of two. I agreed to make it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deputy commander, a man in his 50s, placed a scarf over his face and picked up a .50-caliber machine gun. He pointed it at my head, and one of the guards turned on a camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the filming, I tried to convey that I was reading a prepared statement by intentionally looking down at the pad of paper. I sobbed intermittently but no tears flowed from my eyes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the first take, Abu Tayyeb announced that I hadn't cried enough. He ordered me to read the message a second time. Standing behind the guard holding the camera, Abu Tayyeb waved his hands in the air, as if he were a film director, motioning for me to sob louder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I tried to cry in an exaggerated fashion so that my family would recognize that none of it was real. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that night, Abu Tayyeb announced that the Afghan government had agreed to free 20 prisoners in exchange for our release. The problem, he said, was that my family would not agree to pay the $5 million ransom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My family does not have $5 million,'' I told him angrily. ''Why do you think we have been here for so long? Do you think they're sitting on $5 million and just playing a game? If they had the money, they would offer it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Tayyeb continued. He smiled and told me I was a ''big fish.'' He said my brother was the president of a company that manufactured jumbo jets. If my brother would sell one plane, he explained, my family could pay the ransom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had clearly looked up my family on the Internet. My brother was, in fact, the president of a small aviation consulting company, but it consisted of six people and manufactured nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Tayyeb claimed that the American government paid $10 million for the release of John Solecki, a United Nations worker kidnapped in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in February. As I had for months, I told him that the American government didn't  pay ransom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ignoring me, he said  that the head of the F.B.I.'s office in New York had traveled to Afghanistan to secure my release.  He  vowed to force the  United States government to pay the $5 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You know where the money will come from,'' he said. ''And I know where the money will come from.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I told him that he was delusional and that he should just kill me. Tahir refused to translate my words. ''Don't provoke him,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I told Abu Tayyeb we would ''be here forever'' if he did not reduce his demands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You are a spy,'' Abu Tayyeb declared. ''You know that you are a spy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I told him that he  was absolutely wrong  and that I was a journalist. Then, I tried to shame him in front of his men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''God knows the truth,'' I said. ''And God will judge us all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ABU TAYYEB disappeared the following morning. We spent the next six weeks in a new house in a remote village in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each week, we received bits of information about the negotiations. First, our captors informed us that an agreement had been reached on the 20 Taliban prisoners who would be exchanged for our release. Then they said that not enough money was being offered along with the prisoners. Finally, they told us that only 16 of the 20 prisoners had been agreed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In late May, we were taken back to Miram Shah, where we were informed of a final deal. All that was needed, they said, was for the two sides to agree to where the prisoner exchange would take place. The next day, they announced that there actually was no agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In early June, Abu Tayyeb reappeared and announced that the American government was offering to trade the seven remaining Afghan prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for us. I told him that was ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For months, Abu Tayyeb had been vastly exaggerating my value. He falsely claimed that the American diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke had freed Serbian prisoners in 1995 to win my release in Bosnia, where I was arrested while reporting on war crimes against Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He insisted that I was best friends with Mr. Holbrooke, now the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Then why I am still sitting here after seven months?'' I asked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He smiled. If I made one more video, he said, we would be released. Ashamed of my previous video and convinced that Abu Tayyeb was lying yet again, I refused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is all about you,'' I said, raising my voice. ''You are demanding millions of dollars so you can make yourself look good to the other commanders. You are the problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He declared that he was doing everything ''for the jihad.'' Visibly angry, he again told me to make the video and then left the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thirty minutes later, he returned and said that making the video was not a choice but an order. The half-dozen guards in the room stared at me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once again, Abu Tayyeb repeated his order, and I said no. I knew it was reckless, but standing up to him felt enormously liberating after months of acquiescing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sensing that Abu Tayyeb and his men were about to beat me, Tahir and Asad told me to make the video. ''Just do it,'' Tahir said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I finally relented, but I was determined to turn it into an opportunity to console our families, not worry them. No guns were pointed at my head. I refused to cry. I spoke to the camera calmly and said the three of us were well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the end of the video, I included a message I had wanted to relay since the day we were kidnapped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''However this ends, Kristen and all my family and friends should live in peace with yourselves,'' I said. ''I know you have all done absolutely everything you can to help us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Held by the Taliban: This is the fourth in a series of five articles that offer a first-person account by David Rohde of his seven months as a captive of the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Rohde, a New York Times reporter, was kidnapped with an Afghan journalist, Tahir Luddin, and their driver, Asad Mangal, on Nov. 10, 2008, as they traveled to an interview with a Taliban commander outside Kabul, Afghanistan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, Pakistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Pakistani soldiers fought their way into the forbidding heartland of the Mehsud tribal territory on Tuesday against Taliban and Al Qaeda militants, they faced the most ferocious fighters in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, men whose ancestors were legendary for never succumbing to the British. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A British governor of Waziristan, Sir Olaf Caroe, once wrote that the Mehsud tribesmen were the toughest opponents because, like wolves, they hunted and fought in packs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the fourth day of their offensive, the Pakistani soldiers continued to meet heavy resistance, particularly around the peaks of Kotkai, the hometown of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud. Seven soldiers were killed when militants attacked a checkpoint there, an intelligence official from the area said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One thing was working in the army's favor, however. In the time-honored tradition of the mercurial relationships in the tribal areas, the military has sealed alliances with two Taliban commanders of the Waziri tribe, winning deals  that they  would not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the army on their southern and eastern flanks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two Waziri commanders, Maulvi Nazir and Hafiz Gul Bahadar, control territory that surrounds the lands that are home to the rival Mehsuds and that form the Taliban stronghold where the army has begun its push. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is an expediency that may serve the Pakistani Army, but that could work against American forces in Afghanistan. Both Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar are allied with Sirajuddin Haqqani, who along with his father, Jalaluddin, runs a good part of the insurgency battling American and NATO forces over the border in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news briefing on Monday, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, acknowledged the arrangement with the Taliban leaders of the Waziri tribe, saying any military would do all it could to isolate the enemy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani Army is actually borrowing a page from the British, said Khalid Aziz, a former chief secretary of the North-West Frontier Province who spent years serving as a government official in Waziristan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The British always tried to keep the Waziris on their side, organizing temporary truces with them to isolate the Mehsuds, especially when the British Army was stationed in North and South Waziristan from 1922 until independence in 1947, he said. As well, the Waziris were a little easier for the British to tolerate because, according to Sir Olaf Caroe, they were like panthers and hunted alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the ever-shifting power politics of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal leaders, few expect the new understanding between the army and the two Waziri commanders to stick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not a case of instant love, tribal experts say. Early in the summer, Mr. Bahadar's Taliban fighters ambushed a military convoy killing at least 30 soldiers including a colonel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while it lasts, the new arrangement is of great tactical value to the military. ''It's expediency, it's very temporary,'' Mr. Aziz said. ''But if the army's rear is secure and the right flank is secure, the only part they have to worry about is the fight ahead.'' Only eight months ago, Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar were the best friends of the Mehsud Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, the main domestic enemy of the Pakistani Army, and whose followers the army is now fighting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar had forged a triple entente in February with Baitullah Mehsud in the much-heralded United Mujahedeen Council and had done so at the behest of Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, Taliban spokesmen said at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Mujahedeen Council joined the leading tribes in North and South Waziristan into one cohesive group. At the time, the council represented an ominous sign of militant solidarity against the Pakistani government as terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unleashed from Waziristan steadily escalated on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But then, after the death of Baitullah Mehsud in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, the council fell apart amid recriminations, and Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar quit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Enter the Pakistani Army. As the military planned the operation to take on the Taliban and Qaeda fighters holed up in Mehsud territory, army officers used local government officials to win the neutrality of the disaffected Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most importantly for the army, in the preliminary maneuvers to the current fighting, Mr. Bahadar gave the green light for soldiers to move their supplies uninterrupted and without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through his territory in North Waziristan and into Razmak, a government-held town on the northern edge of the battlefield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What do Mr. Nazir and Mr. Bahadar get out of the bargain? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The provincial government has agreed to allow the Waziri tribesmen loyal to the two commanders to travel on roads that are blocked by the army as part of a siege against the Mehsuds. Short of food and supplies after two months of siege, the freedom to move is a big plus for the Waziri tribesmen, Mr. Aziz said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How long would the deal last? ''If Bahadar thinks he will get tremendous advantage -- like a bag of money -- this agreement will be violated,'' Mr. Aziz said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An editorial in The News, a leading English-language newspaper, summed up the enviable positions that Mr. Nasir and Mr. Bahadar found themselves in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Watching from a position of armed neutrality from the sidelines allows them the luxury of watching their rival suffer at no cost to themselves,'' it  said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a week of fighting Taliban and Qaeda militants in the mountains of South Waziristan, the Pakistani Army said Saturday that it had captured a town important for both its symbolic and strategic value. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The town, Kotkai, most of whose 5,000 residents had already fled, is the home of the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, and one of the most feared Taliban commanders, Qari Hussain. Mr. Hussain is believed to be the organizer and trainer of the group's suicide bombing squads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army has been struggling in the treacherous terrain in South Waziristan, long a militant sanctuary. Military officials said Saturday that Kotkai had been taken only after ''intense fighting.'' Four days ago, the militants repulsed the first army attempt to capture the town and killed nine soldiers, according to a military intelligence officer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the first notable sign of progress in what military analysts say will be an arduous slog for the army against a resilient enemy. And it came as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been enduring a withering series of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the past three weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a military briefing Saturday, the information minister, Qamar Zaman Kaira, acknowledged that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which have focused on police and government sites and have killed about 200 people, had taken a serious toll. But he insisted that ''the nation will not be terrorized.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The farther the army tries to penetrate  South Waziristan, the harder the fighting will get, as soldiers encounter defensive positions dug into the sides of mountains that the guerrillas will battle hard to keep, military analysts and residents of the area said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, on the southeast axis of the army's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into the Taliban stronghold, soldiers will soon encounter the defensive positions leading to Kaniguram, a village about 6,700 feet high that serves as the hide-out of Uzbek fighters, some of the most battle-hardened around, a former resident of the area said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The military's movement is faster than in their previous campaigns,'' a former government official from North Waziristan said, referring to three short-lived army campaigns that ended in negotiated settlements with the Taliban. ''But the more they get inside the sanctuary, the more they will be bogged down.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time may also be working against the army. In past years, many of the Taliban militants fighting American and NATO forces in Afghanistan have come to Waziristan as winter approached to train and prepare for the next year's fighting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although there is evidence that the seasonal fighting in Afghanistan has become a more year-round affair, the concern is that any Taliban fighters who do cross the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be used against the army in South Waziristan. One militant organizer in the region, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the migration had already started, swelling the number of active militants in the region well beyond the present estimates of 7,000 to 10,000.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reinforcements for the militants were also coming from other parts of the Pakistani tribal region,  the militant organizer said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Pakistani soldiers are receiving more support than they did in past campaigns, including better winter gear and air support from fighter jets, the former Waziristan official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have praised the Waziristan offensive, after months of pressure on Pakistani officials to begin. But at the military briefing, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said that the fight was a purely Pakistani enterprise, unaided by the United States or anyone else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There have been no reported missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in South or North Waziristan against Qaeda targets since the beginning of the Pakistani Army offensive a week ago. Both South and North Waziristan have been the focus of the more than 40 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had asked the United States to refrain from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while the army operation was under way in South Waziristan, a senior Pakistani government official said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Families continued to flee South Waziristan, and Mr. Kaira said the government was granting the refugees a month's supply of food and a monthly stipend worth about $50. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The International Committee of the Red Cross said it still had no access to North or South Waziristan to care for civilians. ''We are concerned by the lack of access granted to humanitarian organizations like the I.C.R.C. whose role it is to protect and assist victims of fighting,'' the committee said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere, in the tribal belt in Bajaur, a missile fired from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed 22 people in the town of Damadola on Saturday, two Pakistani officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be aimed at a senior Pakistani Taliban leader, Faqir Mohammad, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They said two relatives of Mr. Mohammad  were killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one fight in South Waziristan, 6 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 20 were wounded. Eleven militants were killed, according to a statement released by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Overnight, in the Torawari area of Hangu, near the border with Afghanistan, militants attacked a government post, killing one soldier and wounding four, the statement said. Torawari lies on the edge of Orakzai Agency, which is a stronghold of the leader of Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military has begun an operation against fighters loyal to Mr. Mehsud in South Waziristan and in recent days succeeded in taking over Kotkai, Mr. Mehsud's hometown. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Chicago men have been charged in what officials said was a plot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> employees of a Danish newspaper that in 2005 published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that offended many Muslims, according to criminal complaints unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most serious charges, conspiracy to murder and maim in a foreign country, were filed against David Coleman Headley, who was born in the United States, lived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and now resides in Chicago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal authorities said Mr. Headley told agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had initially targeted a building occupied by the Danish newspaper, Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten in Copenhagen, but later proposed killing the paper's cartoonist and cultural editor instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The arrests were the latest in what federal officials acknowledged was a surprising surge of unrelated terrorism arrests in recent weeks, highlighted by last month's indictment of Najibullah Zazi, a Denver airport shuttle bus driver who has been accused of conspiring to detonate improvised explosives in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against an undetermined target, possibly in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials offered no specific reason for the increased arrests, though they said some cases involved young men in the United States inspired to militancy by fiery religious appeals on the Internet and in other media outlets rather than by direct contact with terrorist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In contrast, Mr. Headley, 49, who changed his name from Daood Gilani in 2006, and another man, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 48, are older with seemingly more substantial ties to their communities. Mr. Rana is a businessman who was born in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and is now a Canadian citizen living legally in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rana, who is accused of providing material support to terrorism, has known Mr. Headley since they attended the same military school in the Pakistani town of Hasan Abdal, federal officials said. Mr. Rana is accused of using a travel agency to help Mr. Headley arrange visits to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two trips this year to Denmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley was arrested on Oct. 3 at O'Hare airport in Chicago as he was boarding a plane on the first leg of a trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Rana was arrested on Oct. 18 at his home. Both men are scheduled to appear in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the top federal prosecutor in Chicago, said there was no imminent threat in the Chicago area. David S. Kris, head of the Justice Department's national security unit, said the case was a reminder of the threat posed by international terrorism organizations. A senior Danish intelligence official, Jakob Scharf, said in a statement issued by PET, the Danish security service, that his agency ''views this matter very seriously.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Headley's lawyer, John Theis, said he had no comment on the case. Mr. Rana's lawyer, Patrick W. Blegen, said Mr. Rana ''adamantly denies the charges and eagerly awaits his opportunity to contest them in court and clear his and his family's name.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said they regarded the case as significant because Mr. Headley traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and consulted closely with three Pakistani men identified in an F.B.I. affidavit as members of Harakat-ul Jihad Islami, a terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, with whom he referred to the plot as the ''Mickey Mouse Project.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One F.B.I. document said Mr. Headley reported to Ilya Kashmiri, the operational leader of the terrorist group, who is based in a tribal region of northwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The authorities said that when Mr. Kashmiri was mistakenly reported to have been killed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in September, Mr. Headley engaged in a number of coded e-mail exchanges about the impact on planned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mr. Headley concluded after a conversation with Mr. Rana that ''business must go on.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is by Thom Shanker, Peter Baker and Helene Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON -- President Obama's advisers are focusing on a strategy for Afghanistan aimed at protecting about 10 top population centers, administration officials said Tuesday, describing an approach that would stop short of an all-out assault on the Taliban while still seeking to nurture long-term stability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has yet to make a decision and has other options available to him, but as officials described it, the debate is no longer over whether to send more troops, but how many more will be needed. The question of how much of the country should fall under the direct protection of American and NATO forces will be central to deciding how many troops will be sent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the moment, the administration is looking at protecting Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz, Herat, Jalalabad and a few other village clusters, officials said. The first of any new troops sent to Afghanistan would be assigned to Kandahar, the Taliban's  spiritual capital, seen as a center of gravity in pushing back insurgent advances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But military planners are also pressing for enough troops to safeguard major agricultural areas, like the hotly contested Helmand River valley, as well as regional highways essential to the economy -- tasks that would require significantly more reinforcements beyond the 21,000 deployed by Mr. Obama this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One administration official said Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, had briefed Mr. Obama's advisers on how he would deploy any new troops under the approach being considered by the White House. The first two additional combat brigades would go south, including one to Kandahar, while a third would be sent to eastern Afghanistan and a fourth would be used flexibly across the nation, said the official, who like others insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration and military officials said the strategy would include other elements, like accelerated training of Afghan troops, expanded economic development and reconciliation with less radical members of the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But such a strategy would be open to complaints that American and allied forces were in effect giving insurgents free rein across large parts of the nation, allowing the Taliban to establish ministates with training camps that could be used by Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not talking about surrendering the rest of the country to the Taliban,'' a senior administration official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officers said that they would maintain pressure on insurgents in remote regions by using surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and reports from people in the field to find pockets of Taliban fighters and to guide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in particular by Special Operations forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a range of officials made the case that many insurgents fighting Americans in distant locations are motivated not by jihadist ideology, but by local grievances, and are not much of a threat to the United States or to the government in Kabul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of this strategy is the conclusion that the United States cannot completely eradicate the insurgency in a nation where the Taliban is an indigenous force -- nor does it need to in order to protect American national security. Instead, the focus would be on preventing Al Qaeda from returning in force while containing and weakening the Taliban long enough to build Afghan security forces that would eventually take over the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In effect, the approach blends ideas advanced by General McChrystal and by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., seen as opposite poles in the internal debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General McChrystal has sought at least 40,000 more troops for a counterinsurgency strategy to protect Afghan civilians so they will support the central government. Mr. Biden has opposed a buildup, contending that a bigger military footprint could be counterproductive and that fighting Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be the top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A strategy of protecting major Afghan population centers would be ''McChrystal for the city, Biden for the country,'' as one administration official put it. Officials said Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was playing a crucial role, balancing the case made by commanders with the skepticism of some civilians on Mr. Obama's war council as the debate entered its final days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior military officer said the developing strategy adopted General McChrystal's central tenet. ''We are no longer thinking about just destroying the enemy in a conventional way,'' the officer said. ''We must remove the main pressure that civilians live under, which is the constant intimidation and corruption and direct threat from the insurgency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer said General McChrystal wanted the most expansive definition of population centers to include fertile valleys, economic belts and major roadways, in particular the national ring road central for commerce, as well as four or five roadways linking Afghanistan eastward to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and westward to Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials said no exact statistics were available for the percentage of the Afghan population that would fall under a new population-centered policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elements of the strategy are already being carried out. Over the past month, General McChrystal has closed half a dozen isolated military outposts in towns like Wanat, where nine Americans were killed in a vicious firefight in July 2008. The decision to close these bases has allowed the general to shift nearly 1,000 troops to other missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Historical analogies are imperfect, but the strategy being put in place can be viewed as a rejection of arguments that individual villages have a strategic importance -- a Vietnam-era mistake -- instead building on the lessons of the Iraq troop increase, when large population areas received the most reinforcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been working closely with the administration on Afghanistan, signaled the current thinking in a speech on Monday: ''We don't have to control every hamlet and village, particularly when non-Pashtun sections of the country are already hostile to the Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One possible focus in the administration debate centers on Helmand, a lightly populated farming area and Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. For years, insurgents controlled much of the province, but Marines arrived in force this year to reinforce British troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some administration officials ask whether it makes sense for 20 percent of the foreign forces to be protecting 3 percent of the country's population. But others point out that Helmand's fertile valley is important to Afghanistan's economy and that it has become a major source of opium used to finance the insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama will meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, his seventh major session since beginning his review. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the Pakistani government plays down the American role in its military operations in Taliban-controlled areas along the border with Afghanistan, the United States has quietly rushed hundreds of millions of dollars in arms, equipment and sophisticated sensors to Pakistani forces in recent months, said senior American and Pakistani officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During preparations this spring for the Pakistani campaigns in Swat and South Waziristan, President Obama personally intervened at the request of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top army general to speed the delivery of 10 Mi-17 troop transport helicopters. Senior Pentagon officials have also hurried spare parts for Cobra helicopter gunships, night vision goggles, body armor and eavesdropping equipment to the fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are feeding video images and target information to Pakistani ground commanders, and the Pentagon has quietly provided the Pakistani Air Force with high-resolution, infrared sensors for F-16 warplanes, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is using to guide bomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on militants' strongholds in South Waziristan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, the number of American Special Forces soldiers and support personnel who are training and advising Pakistani Army and paramilitary troops has doubled in the past eight months,  to as many as 150, an American adviser said. The Americans do not conduct combat operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The increasing American role in shoring up the Pakistani military's counterinsurgency abilities comes as the Obama administration debates how much of a troop commitment to make in neighboring Afghanistan. It also takes place as Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are spreading into Pakistani cities. It is unclear whether Pakistani authorities are using any of the sophisticated surveillance equipment to combat the urban terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Underscoring the complexity of the relationship between the allies, Pakistani officials are loath to publicize the aid because of the deep-seated anti-American sentiment in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And they privately express frustration about the pace and types of aid, which totals about $1.5 billion this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a military briefing on Saturday, the Pakistani Army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said the fight in South Waziristan was a purely Pakistani enterprise, unaided by the United States or anyone else. ''Let us finish the job on our own,'' he told reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hasan Askari Rizvi, a military analyst in Lahore, said that publicly acknowledging the military aid -- an open secret in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- could hand militants fresh ammunition for propaganda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks. ''The Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military would not like to talk about the U.S. assistance,'' he said, ''so that the Islamists, most of whom are opposed to military operations, do not get additional reason to criticize the military and the government.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  whom the Pakistani government directed earlier this year not to discuss the United States role in providing humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes by the fighting in Swat --  said the same edict applied to war assistance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Pakistanis insist on 'no American face' on their war. Period,'' said one senior American military officer in Southwest Asia, who would speak only anonymously because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with his Pakistani counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the reluctance of Pakistani and American officials to speak openly about the assistance, it is difficult to assess how effective the American aid has been in the current combat operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beneath their official silence, many senior Pakistani military officials seethe at the months, or even years, of delay by the Pentagon in delivering promised hardware and troop reimbursements. They also gripe that the United States is denying them the best technology, like Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Apache helicopter gunships. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are grateful for the generosity but believe that we have now learned to fight with what all we possess and not what has been promised,'' said one senior Pakistani officer, who was granted anonymity to provide a candid assessment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center  of the Atlantic Council, a nonprofit policy and research group,  sharply criticized the Obama administration in an essay on the organization's Web site last week. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still does not have all the weapons or assistance that it needs to do the job right,'' he wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged the frustrations in an interview this week with Dawn, a Pakistani daily newspaper, before arriving on a trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We both have bureaucracies,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We know how it is sometimes that things get delayed or they're slower than we want, but we're really trying to accelerate everything we can to help the Pakistani military.'' Mrs. Clinton did not provide any details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American adviser in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal United States policy, said, ''U.S. current military assistance either demonstrates U.S. resolve and offsets anti-Americanism, or is deliberately underplayed to boost Pakistani military and political credibility, and the latter meets our policy objectives more closely.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has provided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with about $12 billion in military assistance and payments since the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pentagon reimburses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about $1 billion a year to cover its costs of fielding more than 100,000 troops along the Afghan border in counterinsurgency operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the past year, the Defense Department has significantly increased the shipment of military equipment to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to combat the increasingly violent insurgency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most significant was Mr. Obama's involvement in speeding the delivery of the 10 Russian-built Mi-17s, at the request of the Pakistani army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Four of the transport helicopters were leased to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in June, and the rest were provided under different authorities to move Pakistani Army soldiers in the border region near Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The president was engaged on this issue in the spring,'' said a White House official, who spoke anonymously because he was discussing Mr. Obama's involvement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also involved was Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who repeatedly pressed his staff to find the Mi-17s in American inventories and to figure out a way to provide them to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This year alone, the Pentagon is sending more than $500 million in arms, equipment and training assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to help train and equip the Pakistani military for counterinsurgency operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Included in that package is nearly $13 million in electronic eavesdropping equipment to intercept militants' cellphone calls. In July, the Pentagon supplied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with 200 night vision goggles, 100 day/night scopes, more than 600 radios and 9,475 sets of body armor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon has also sharply increased programs to bring Pakistani officers to the United States for training, particularly in counterterrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've put military assistance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a wartime footing, as up to now it has been in a peacetime process,'' said Lt. Col. Mark Wright, a Pentagon spokesman. ''We are doing everything within our power to assist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in improving its counterinsurgency capabilities.'' </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a small village in the dun-colored hills of South Waziristan, soldiers found a German passport belonging to Said Bahaji, a German citizen and associate of Mohammed Atta, the leader of the 9/11 hijackers. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The apparent presence of Mr. Bahaji in the tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a clear indication that members of the Qaeda network --  including participants in the 9/11 plot --  have taken refuge here, as American officials, like Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday, have charged. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no indication that Mr. Bahaji had left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Bahaji was not a central plotter in the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he lived for eight months in Hamburg with Mr. Atta and Ramzi bin al Shibh, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was described in the report as ''an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It added: ''Atta and Binalshibh used Bahaji's computer for Internet research, as evidenced by documents and diskettes seized by German authorities after 9/11.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A United States counterterrorism official said the documents ''appear to be this guy,'' and that American officials believe ''he's in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and is a senior Qaeda propagandist.'' The official spoke anonymously to discuss classified assessments of Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Soldiers also found a Spanish passport belonging to Raquel Burgos Garcia, who is believed to be Mr. Bahaji's wife. She wore an Islamic headscarf in her passport photo; an accompanying identity card showed that she had attended school in Morocco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The documents were shown to reporters on a day trip organized by the army on Thursday for the news media to observe operations in the nearly two-week-old battle. South Waziristan is off limits to foreign reporters, and most Pakistani reporters, without special permission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army was using artillery and jet fighters to break the back of the militants. Rounds of artillery thundered around the mountains at midday, and the sound of jets echoed through the valleys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The offensive in South Waziristan has turned into a battle of wills between the army, the custodian of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear weapons and accustomed to facing archenemy India, and insurgents from the Taliban and Al Qaeda, who are determined to bring down the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The guerrillas established a sanctuary here four years ago to plan their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In retaliation, the insurgents have struck with ferocity at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> urban centers and military installations using sleeper cells and commando fighters to wreak havoc and fear, killing large numbers of civilians like never before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assaults, particularly a car bomb that killed more than 100 people in the narrow alleys of an old bazaar in Peshawar on Wednesday and was aimed at women and children, are interpreted by many Pakistanis as an effort to break the will of the public and turn opinion against the military operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The militants, they point out, are not concerned with public support and just want to be left alone in their faraway stronghold, which has become a magnet for foreign militants from diverse backgrounds, according to an array of documents captured in houses by the Pakistani military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, the public appears to be supportive of the army and impatient with the militants, though many Pakistanis ask whether a foreign hand, meaning the United States or India, is behind the militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past, the army fared poorly in South Waziristan, the southernmost region of the tribal areas where the Taliban and Al Qaeda have operated at will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2005, under the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army forged a peace deal in South Waziristan with Baitullah Mehsud, then the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, in a move that legitimized Mr. Mehsud's authority with the Mehsud tribesmen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A series of embarrassing encounters for the military followed. In 2007, the militants seized more than 40 soldiers at their fort at Sararogha and killed most of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, the military abandoned its fort at Ladha, another militant stronghold, and the insurgents promptly blew up the British colonial-era structure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now the military is trying to recapture its reputation in South Waziristan, and to re-establish its presence. It is doing so with many more soldiers than in past operations in South Waziristan, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the military spokesman, who ushered reporters around on a M-17 helicopter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the militants' passports, found in the village of Chalvashti, soldiers discovered a small house in a nearby town marked as a ''laboratory'' that was used for the manufacture of roadside bombs, Brig. Mohammed Shafiq said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the top of a rocky outpost called Spin Jamaat in Sherwangai, the commander of the forces in the area, Gen. Khalid Rabbani, sounded a confident note as he surveyed a vast landscape of hills and scarce vegetation. ''The terrorists have gone into deeper areas, and the exits are choked,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the fact that the insurgents were retreating deeper inside their stronghold around the towns of Makeen, Ladha and Sararogha, near densely forested mountains, may not bode well for the army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am afraid the army is being sucked in and then the terrorists will hit hard using hit-and-run tactics,'' said a resident of the Mehsud area recently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, the army has concentrated on taking territory along the main road, a thin ribbon of rock-strewn gravel that was first laid down by the British. The troops have proceeded slowly, even though this roadside terrain was relatively easy, compared to the mountain passages that lay ahead, soldiers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next target, Kuniguram, has served as the headquarters for the Uzbek fighters, the Taliban's most brutal warriors. The army had surrounded Kuniguram on three sides, General Rabbani said, and clouds of white smoke from artillery fire onto the ridge in front of Kuniguram could be seen in the early afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The army expected its toughest fight so far to capture Kuniguram, the most substantial town under militant control that it had taken on so far, the general said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a separate axis from Kuniguram, the army was approaching Sararogha, the operational hub of the Taliban, General Abbas said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It appeared, he said, that Wali ur-Rehman, the second in command of the Pakistani Taliban, was directing operations from Sararogha, where the army signed a peace deal with Mr. Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistani Taliban. Mr. Mehsud was killed in an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suspect in the 9/11 plot whose German passport was found in a mud hut in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week has not been in touch with his family for two years, his mother said in a telephone interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The suspect, Said Bahaji, a German citizen whose father is Moroccan, was the main logistics supporter of the 9/11 attackers, paying their rent and telephone bills, according to the authorities. The Pakistani military said it found his German passport five days ago in the village of Sherwangai in South Waziristan, during a search operation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bahaji was part of the Hamburg cell of Al Qaeda, a tightly knit group of young Arab men who met in Germany in the mid- to late 1990s under the leadership of Mohamed Atta, who eventually became the central planner of the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said that Mr. Bahaji was not in custody, and that the military did not know whether he was dead or alive. He said the passport stamp for Mr. Bahaji's entry into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Sept. 4, 2001 -- was too old to shed any light on his current whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pakistani military is in the second week of a major military operation against militants in their South Waziristan stronghold, and General Abbas said one aim was to flush out foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  German intelligence officials have said they believe that Mr. Bahaji, who is still on the German authorities' wanted list, has been in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas since Sept. 11, 2001. The discovery of the passport this week was the first concrete evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many top Qaeda members are believed to have taken refuge in the area. A Pakistani intelligence official interviewed on Friday said the discovery ''proves that our militants have had close associations with Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed a number of senior Qaeda members in the tribal areas, including Usama al-Kini, a Kenyan, who was the group's operations chief in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as Baitullah Mehsud, who led the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  German officials reached by telephone on Friday did not give details about Mr. Bahaji's last known contact, but said they did not dispute the time frame given by his mother, Anneliese Bahaji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Bahaji, 76, a German citizen, said her son also had a Moroccan passport, so it was possible that he was traveling with that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bahaji, who was born in June 1975, had never been to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before setting off in September 2001, his mother said. She said he had told her and his wife, Nese Kul, a German citizen of Turkish descent, from whom he is now divorced, that he was going to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for an internship at a computer company there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Bahaji last heard from him in 2007, when he telephoned her. ''He said he just wanted to call and say he's still alive,'' she said by telephone from northern Germany, where she lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In many ways, the passport raised more questions than it answered. ''I don't know what to think that they've found his passport now,'' Mrs. Bahaji said, sounding sad. ''I don't know what it means.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Hamburg cell seemed to be the one place where Mr. Bahaji felt truly accepted. He tried to enter a military academy in Morocco, his mother said, but was turned down because he had asthma. When he moved to Germany, she added, he was required to attend additional classes before his Moroccan high school degree would be accepted, deepening his sense that he was a stranger there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In late 1998, according to evidence introduced in a German court in the trial of another Hamburg cell member, Mounir el-Motassadeq, Mr. Bahaji and Mr. Atta moved into an apartment near the university where they had been studying in Hamburg. The young men grew increasingly radical, with the help of a German of Syrian origin, Mohamed Heidar Zammar, who had fought in Bosnia and was believed to be a Qaeda operative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bahaji grew close to Mr. Atta and the other members of the cell. They attended Mr. Bahaji's wedding in October 1999, at Al Quds mosque in Hamburg, feasting on Moroccan tagine stew with plums and sweets, his wife, Ms. Kul, said in an interview in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A video of the event was introduced as evidence in the German court. Men sat separately from the women, Ms. Kul said, and Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted the second plane that struck the World Trade Center, sang songs about jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Relatives were reportedly shocked at the change in Mr. Bahaji, who had grown a long beard, much to his mother's chagrin. ''The beard has to go,'' Mrs. Bahaji told him, and he replied, ''No, the beard stays,'' she said in an interview two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The last time Ms. Kul saw Mr. Bahaji was on Sept. 3, 2001. Before departing he went to the mosque where they had gotten married. When he returned, his hair was cut short, she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has had her ups and downs with the news media, the prospect of spending three days under the remorseless glare of the Pakistani news media might have felt like an unwelcome return to a time right before the New Hampshire primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Mrs. Clinton, whose press clippings since she became secretary of state have been kinder than when she was a presidential candidate, rolled with the punches this week in a media-saturated tour of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. She submitted to four round-table interviews over three days in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leading journalists took their best shots at her, and she even counterpunched once or twice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time she left Islamabad on Friday, she appeared to have fought </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fourth estate to a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''On the whole, Ms. Clinton made a very deliberate effort to bridge the divide that has recently grown and talked of constructing a special relationship,'' said an editorial in The News, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main English-language daily newspapers. It did, however, chide her for snarling traffic in Lahore, the country's second-largest city, which she visited on Thursday under elaborate security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Engaging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unruly media was perhaps Mrs. Clinton's most important job on this visit. Newspapers and television drive public opinion more here than in many countries, and the coverage is sharply critical of the United States, tapping into deep Pakistani resentment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That poses a problem for the Obama administration, which needs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to join its campaign to fight extremists and stabilize Afghanistan. The latest spike in anti-American sentiment here was driven by media reports that a new aid bill would infringe on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I will admit that clearly there is a lot of misperception, and perception is reality, so therefore it is up to us to try to set it straight,'' Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday in an interview with seven television journalists. ''Frankly, I think one of the problems is that we did not have a program to reach out to the Pakistani press. That will never happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Najam Sethi, the editor of The Friday Times, an English-language weekly, said ''the media is part of the problem, not the solution.'' Much of the news media, he said, is  driven by fervent nationalism and uncritical support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> murky entanglements with radical groups in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the press was unshackled by President Pervez Musharraf during his last years in power, it exploded into a cacophony of publications, many of which gleefully traffic in rumors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She did well to interact,'' Mr. Sethi said. ''She may not have made many new friends, but she certainly didn't make new enemies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton sat down first with the TV journalists because they set the agenda. So great is their influence that the questions posed to Mrs. Clinton by young people the next day sounded like those the broadcasters had asked -- blunt and combative, though just short of rude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An example came Friday at an interview for the program ''Our Voice'' when a young woman asked Mrs. Clinton whether she viewed the Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used by the United States in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> frontier areas as terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No, I do not,'' she replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier in the week when Mrs. Clinton was asked about this highly classified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, she steadfastly declined to comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton showed a similar flash of defiance when she was asked why the United States viewed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the focus of the global campaign against terrorism. She pointed out that Al Qaeda's leaders had sought refuge in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since 2002 and she suggested that the Pakistani government had done less than it should have to root them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the interview on Friday, she was also asked why the United States micromanaged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> affairs, why there was such a deep ''trust deficit'' between the countries, and whether the private security contractors who guard the embassy here were shielded by diplomatic immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton answered the first two but said she was not sure of the answer to the third. Pakistani papers have run articles reporting that contractors were illegally carrying weapons in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The newspapers and television gave ample coverage to Mrs. Clinton's visit. But some could not resist taking a shot: The Nation, an English-language daily, carried an unflattering front-page picture of Mrs. Clinton, with her eyes bulging and her face twisted in mock horror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, news channels juxtaposed images of Mrs. Clinton with carnage at the women's market in Peshawar, connecting her arrival with the car bomb that killed more than 100 people the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton said she had expected a rough reception. One aide said she insisted on not excluding journalists known for their anti-American views, against the advice of some at the embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also went out of her way to cultivate radio journalists, giving them an hourlong interview on Friday. The special American representative for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Richard C. Holbrooke, is developing a plan to encourage new FM radio stations as a way to counterbalance propaganda from radio stations that fall into the hands of the Taliban or other militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They use the radio to say that women shouldn't go to school, to say that women shouldn't go out of their homes,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''You know, that's very intimidating, that's very frightening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the end of her visit, Madam Secretary seemed to have fine-tuned her image. A senior American official said that when Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the director of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-Services Intelligence agency, met her on Thursday evening, he told her that he was touched by photos of her wearing a pale-blue headscarf as she toured a Sufi shrine in Islamabad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After disrupting two recent terrorism plots, American intelligence officials are increasingly concerned that extremist groups in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> linked to Al Qaeda are planning smaller operations in the United States that are harder to detect but more likely to succeed than the spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they once emphasized, senior counterterrorism officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two cases -- one involving two Chicago men accused this week of planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the prophet Mohammad, the other a 24-year-old Denver shuttle bus driver indicted in a plot to use improvised explosives -- are among the most serious in years, the officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In both, the officials said, the main defendants are long-term residents of the United States with substantial community ties who traveled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas, where they apparently trained with extremist groups affiliated with Al Qaeda. The officials, from American military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, spoke on the condition that they not be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to F.B.I. documents, David Coleman Headley, 49, the principal defendant in the Chicago case, met with Ilyas Kashmiri, who is regarded by Western authorities as one of the most dangerous Islamic militants operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> restive tribal areas. Mr. Kashmiri turned to terrorism after serving as a Pakistani special operations commando, and has drawn renewed focus from United States officials after surviving an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's a consummate opportunist and a master strategist who has both intimate local knowledge and a vicious global agenda,'' said Jarret Brachman, author of ''Global Jihadism'' and a consultant to the United States government about terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The authorities have been struck in the Denver and Chicago plots by the central roles played by men who seem to have been more security conscious and better organized and trained than many of those involved in terrorism cases brought since 2001, including a surge of arrests in recent weeks. A number of those arrested were young men inflamed with militant zeal but few skills to carry out an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some officials said that while the Chicago and Denver cases stood out from lower-level terrorism prosecutions in the United States, it was not new for would-be terrorists to travel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other training grounds and return home to engage in militant activity. They said the activities of Najibullah Zazi, the Denver man, closely resembled the methodology of the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the London subway bombings in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A case last year suggests that young men from the United States are also finding their way to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight American forces. Bryant Neal Vinas, 26, grew up on Long Island and worked as a truck driver for the Long Island Rail Road before going to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He made contact with a Qaeda group and took part in a rocket </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an American base in Afghanistan before being captured in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and brought back to the United States in November 2008. Since then, Mr. Vinas has cooperated with the authorities, helping to identify other extremists who trained for operations in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The model of young men who have lived for years in the United States before traveling overseas and connecting  with militant Islamist groups is not confined to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In October 2008, for example, a Somali-American teenager from Minneapolis carried out a suicide bombing in northern Somalia. The teenager, Shirwa Ahmed, had come to the United States in the 1990s and became a citizen. In the months before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he had traveled to the Horn of Africa and apparently joined up with Al Shabab, a militant Muslim group fighting the Ethiopians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Government counterterrorism analysts said it was significant that the Chicago and Denver cases involved plots that seem less ambitious than the World Trade Center and Pentagon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or suspected plots of the past, like those aimed at Los Angeles International Airport or the Sears Tower in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Western intelligence officials believed that Al Qaeda's leadership concentrated on spectacular, mass-casualty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to build its credibility in the Islamic world. American analysts said the difficulty of carrying out such grandiose plots offered a measure of protection to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  J. Patrick Rowan, a former top lawyer in the Justice Department's national security division, said the recent cases could mean shifting away from large-scale plots. ''There has always been a view that Al Qaeda wants to duplicate or do something even more substantial than 9/11,'' Mr. Rowan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The hypothesis has been that they have focused their resources on carrying out a spectacular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and decided not to pursue lesser plots,'' he said. ''These cases would seem to undercut that hypothesis and suggest they might be rethinking their strategy, which is obviously worrisome because smaller operations may be harder to detect and stop.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the most important figures in this emerging trend is Mr. Kashmiri, the operational commander of Harakat-ul Jihad Islami, a Pakistani terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, whom one American official described as a ''nightmare guy'' because he was ''an operator who could make things happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kashmiri, 45, has a long history of waging guerrilla operations. As a Pakistani army trainer of Afghan mujahedeen, he lost an eye battling Russian forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Later, while working with Kashmiri militants attacking India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archenemy, he earned wide renown in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after escaping from an Indian jail where he was imprisoned for two years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Kashmiri turned against the state after President Pervez Musharraf banned his group after the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was arrested four years later in connection with an attempted assassination of Mr. Musharraf in December 2003, but released because of lack of evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Pakistani government laid siege to Islamic militants in the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July 2007, Mr. Kashmiri moved his operations to North Waziristan and took up arms with Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban there. He is listed as the fourth-most-wanted man by the Pakistani Ministry of the Interior, according to Pakistani media reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say Mr. Kashmiri is among the most dangerous militant leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> today because of training skills, commando experience and strategic vision to carry out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Western targets, like the Danish newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brachman said that while militants like Mr. Kashmiri were not under Al Qaeda's direct control, they were responding to the terrorist organization's rallying cry to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the West. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For years now Al Qaeda has been calling their movement to arms -- sowing seeds across the global movement,'' Mr. Brachman said. ''What is clear, however, is that the seeds are now starting to sprout.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration is stepping up pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to expand and reorient its fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, warning that failing to do so would undercut the new strategy and troop increase for Afghanistan that President Obama is preparing to approve, American officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Afghanistan has dominated the public discussion of Mr. Obama's strategy, which officials say could be announced as early as this week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is returning to center stage in administration planning. As the president traveled to Asia, his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, was quietly sent to Islamabad, its capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His message, officials said, was that the new American strategy would work only if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> broadened its fight beyond the militants attacking its cities and security forces and went after the groups that use havens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for plotting and carrying out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against American troops in Afghanistan, as well as support networks for Al Qaeda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Jones praised the Pakistani operation in South Waziristan but urged Pakistani officials to combat extremists who fled to North Waziristan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Jones also delivered a letter from Mr. Obama to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Asif Ali Zardari, in which Mr. Obama said he expected Mr. Zardari to rally the nation's political and national security institutions in a united campaign against extremists threatening </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, said an official briefed on the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For their part, Pakistani officials have told the Americans that they harbor two deep fears about Mr. Obama's new strategy: that the United States will add too many troops on the Afghan side of the border, and that the American effort will end too soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their first concern, described by officials on both sides of the recent discussions, is that if Mr. Obama commits an additional 30,000 or more troops, it will inevitably push more Taliban fighters across the border into Pakistani territory and complicate the  South Waziristan offensive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every time Mr. Obama declares that the United States will not have an ''open-ended'' military commitment in Afghanistan, he fuels a second concern of the powerful Pakistani military and intelligence establishment, which believes the United States commitment is fleeting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a concern that some of them say justifies </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continuing ties to the militants who fight American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared to fuel this concern on Sunday in her comments on the ABC program ''This Week,'' saying: ''We're not interested in staying in Afghanistan. We have no long-term stake there. We want that to be made very clear.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White House officials have said comparatively little about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side of the administration's evolving war strategy, in part because they have so few options. They cannot place forces inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and they cannot talk publicly about the Central Intelligence Agency's Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the country, though they are so much of an open secret that Mrs. Clinton was asked about them repeatedly in meetings she held late last month with Pakistani students and citizens. (She refused to acknowledge the program's existence.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his letter to Mr. Zardari, Mr. Obama offered a range of new incentives to the Pakistanis for their cooperation, including enhanced intelligence sharing and military cooperation, according to the official who had been briefed on the letter's contents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During Mr. Obama's Situation Room briefings on his alternatives, those advocating a minimal commitment of new troops in Afghanistan have argued that the United States needs only enough forces to keep Al Qaeda ''bottled up'' in the mountainous tribal areas of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You could argue that even under the status quo, we don't see Al Qaeda coming into Afghanistan,'' said one official sympathetic to this view. ''And so an additional commitment of forces isn't going to apply more pressure on our main target.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those arguing for a more forceful presence -- including Mrs. Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen -- have contended that while Afghanistan is not now a haven for Al Qaeda, it could easily become one if the Taliban make further inroads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have praised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders for finally launching comprehensive military </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Taliban forces that have conducted suicide bombings in the capital, on the military headquarters and last week against a key office of the main Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Americans are now trying, as the Bush administration did with little success, to persuade </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do more, not just against the Qaeda leadership holed up in the country's unruly tribal areas, but also against the Afghan Taliban leadership in the southern Pakistani city of Quetta and the Haqqani militant network in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who heads the House Homeland Security subcommittee on intelligence and who visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week, summed up the administration's frustrations and her own after meetings with senior Pakistani officials: ''They are focused on who they think are threats to them. Period.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A recurring theme in Mrs. Clinton's visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the perception that the United States and NATO forces are drawing down troops along the Afghan border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. This, Pakistani officials said, allows Afghan militants to pour across the border into South Waziristan, where they become </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton argued that NATO had actually increased troop levels along that border but had decided to consolidate about a half-dozen remote outposts into fewer, larger installations, because they were easier to defend. According to American military officials, the Pakistani military got no warning of the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So great was the Pakistani concern over the outpost closures that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, made a special point during an unannounced trip to Islamabad after Mrs. Clinton's visit to reassure Pakistani officials of American resolve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're stuck between not wanting to suggest we're going to be there forever, but on the other hand, if we don't show some kind of commitment, everyone continues to play the same game,'' a senior administration official said Sunday. ''That's the challenge.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Pakistanis voice concerns about a lack of American commitment, they express equal concern that sending tens of thousands more American troops to Afghanistan could force Taliban militants into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Whatever we do -- put in more troops or put in fewer troops -- they'll freak out,'' said an American intelligence officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his relations with Pakistani officials. But the intelligence officer acknowledged that the long-term security picture and the American commitment in Afghanistan were still unclear. ''Look, if I were in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I'd be hedging my bets, too,'' the officer said. ''We need to be much more convincing that we have a better game plan.'' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said that the group accepted responsibility for only some of the recent suicide bombings in Pakistan, blaming others on the American security firm formerly known as Blackwater.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Al Jazeera reported that a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the group accepted responsibility for only some of the recent suicide bombings in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, laying the blame for others, including a deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a market last month that killed more than 100 civilians, on the American security firm formerly known as Blackwater. The spokesman claimed that the firm, now called Xe, was involved in an attempt to discredit the militants by staging deadly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This video report from Al Jazeera includes shots of of Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the broad alliance of Pakistani militant groups known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban, saying, &quot;I want to tell the people in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Muslim nation that the Tehrik-i-Taliban are not responsible for the bombings, but Blackwater and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spy agency are behind them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Associated Press, the spokesman tried to pass off blame for two recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that were particularly deadly, saying:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dirty Pakistani intelligence agencies, for the sake of creating mistrust and hatred among people against the Taliban, are carrying out blasts at places like the Islamic university, Islamabad, and the Khyber bazaar, Peshawar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The A.P. also reported that the video, posted on YouTube on Sunday, bore the logo of Al Qaeda's media wing, As-Sahab. The A.P. noted that this was &quot;the first time the Taliban spokesman has appeared in an As-Sahab video,&quot; suggesting that there are &quot;growing links between the two groups.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier report on the Web site of The Daily Times, a publication based in Lahore, said that the spokesman had also suggested that the ruling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People's Party was involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adding, &quot;All these killings by the infamous Blackwater are aimed at maligning the Taliban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Issam Ahmed of The Christian Science Monitor reported from Peshawar that some Pakistanis were ready to believe that the American private security firm is the enemy, rather than the Taliban. Mr. Ahmed reported:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's operatives are often viewed by Pakistanis as akin to C.I.A. agents, and local conspiracy theories sometimes assert that the U.S. with the help of Blackwater, rather than the Taliban, are responsible for the suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [...]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Faizullah Jan, a lecturer at the department of journalism and mass communication at the University of Peshawar, such conspiracy theories are fed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mainstream media and the proliferation of underground jihadist media outlets. &quot;In such an environment anything which is seemingly obvious is not real, and anything which is hidden is deemed to be real,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it is not hard to find reports in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> media that blame American private contractors and the intelligence agencies of other countries for terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the country. Last month the Web site </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily reported that a former chief of staff of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> army had claimed in a television interview that Blackwater was involved in the assassination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The same Web site published an editorial days later claiming that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing Pakistani civilians were carried out by &quot;Blackwater Talibans&quot; working on behalf of &quot;the underground drug mafia controlled by the Zionists.&quot; Pointing to an even broader conspiracy the same writer suggested,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of various Talibans which include Indian Talibans, Israeli Talibans, Karzai Talibans... British Talibans and American Talibans which of course include Blackwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the United States government has employed the private security firm to work in secret inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes it hard to knock down the wilder conspiracy theories. My colleagues James Risen and Mark Mazzetti reported in August:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a secret division at its North Carolina headquarters, the company formerly known as Blackwater has assumed a role in Washington's most important counterterrorism program: the use of remotely piloted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kill Al Qaeda's leaders, according to government officials and current and former employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The division's operations are carried out at hidden bases in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, where the company's contractors assemble and load Hellfire missiles and 500-pound laser-guided bombs on remotely piloted Predator aircraft, work previously performed by employees of the Central Intelligence Agency. They also provide security at the covert bases, the officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks after that news broke, it became fodder for the Pakistani journalist and blogger Ahmed Quraishi, who dug into the Web site of the United States Training Center, which calls itself &quot;a Xe company,&quot; and noticed that job applicants were directed to a form -- posted on the Web site Blackwaterusa.com -- that includes Urdu and Punjabi in a list of languages that prospective contractors might speak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Quraishi took one look at that form and jumped to publish his conclusion that &quot;hiring continues as we speak for agents and for people with military training who can speak Urdu, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national language, and Punjabi, spoken by the natives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest populated province.&quot; Mr. Quraishi took no note of the fact that the list of languages applicants might be proficient in also includes German, Italian, Thai and sign language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One imagines it won't take long for conspiracy-minded Pakistanis reading Sunday's report in The Los Angeles Times that the C.I.A. has been bringing &quot;ISI operatives to a secret training facility in North Carolina&quot; to notice that the Web site of United States Training includes a photograph of its center in Moycock, N.C. above a statement that the company &quot;is currently training select military and other government groups from U.S.-friendly nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps picking up on the popular mood, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, reportedly blamed foreign militants for the violence during a meeting with leaders of the Mehsud tribes from Waziristan on Tuesday. According to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Mr. Gilani &quot;said foreign militants of Arab, Uzbek, Afghan and Chechen origin were operating in the country and were involved in terrorist activities.&quot; Dawn also reported that the prime minister said that the tribesmen, despite their links to the former Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, were blameless:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilani categorically stated that the Mehsud tribes were patriotic Pakistanis and had nothing to do with the handful of terrorists who had taken refuge in their area. He lauded the role of the tribal people in the creation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said the nation can never forget it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Justice Department's decision to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a federal court in New York City has elicited several criticisms. Most are pointless, but one -- the idea that it will give a terrorist a platform from which he could stir up support in the Muslim world for his radical views -- is well taken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, let's dispose of the straw men. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, accused the Obama administration of ''treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue'' -- as though ''law enforcement'' is an epithet. In truth, the White House's counterterrorism team is composed largely of the same professionals who battled terrorists under President George W. Bush. They are generally in sync with the White House's insistence on a strategy that uses law enforcement where appropriate and military force in places, like Afghanistan, where conspirators can't be arrested by federal agents driving Fords. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others complain that Mr. Mohammed might take advantage of quirks of the criminal justice system and go free. That's highly unlikely. First, he has already confessed to the crime; and, given the zero acquittal rate for terrorists in New York previously, any anxiety about a ''not guilty'' verdict seems unwarranted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Yoo, a former Bush administration lawyer, argues that the trial would be an ''intelligence bonanza'' for our enemies. Also unlikely. Our prosecutors are certain that there is enough unclassified evidence to make their case. Moreover, the most prized intelligence is recent, specific and actionable. Al Qaeda today is most concerned with discovering when and where the next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take place in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> information not likely to be disclosed during a trial about a conspiracy hatched more than a decade ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which brings us to the idea that allowing Mr. Mohammed to take the stand will give him a soapbox. The truth is, if the trial provides a propaganda platform for anybody, it will be for our side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, federal courts do not permit TV cameras in the courtroom, so the opportunity for ''real time'' jihadist propagandizing won't exist. And while defendants and their lawyers can question witnesses, they cannot make speeches; judges are kings in this domain and can quash irrelevant oratory. Some point out that in earlier terrorism trials, like those of the plotters of the 1993 World Trade Center </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the defendants did ramble at length. True, but does anyone who fears a circus now remember a single word from those earlier trials? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The real propaganda event is likely to unfold very differently. Instead of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed making his case, we will see the full measure of the horror of 9/11 outlined to the world in a way that only methodical trials can accomplish. Historically, the public exposure of state-sponsored mass murder or terrorism through a transparent judicial process has strengthened the forces of good and undercut the extremists. The Nuremberg trials were a classic case. And nothing more effectively alerted the world to the danger of genocide than Israel's prosecution in 1961  of Adolf Eichmann, the bureaucrat who engineered the Holocaust. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the case of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alternatives -- indefinite incarceration without trial, or a military tribunal closed to the public followed by execution -- are far more likely to inspire militant recruits. And highlighting the transparency in our judicial process would strengthen America's reputation just as cracks are beginning to appear in the jihadist base. A growing number of radical Muslim clerics and theoreticians have reversed course in recent years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, three of Saudi Arabia's most influential radical clerics -- Nasir bin Hamad al-Fahd, Ali al-Khudair and Ahmed al-Khalidi (once described by Osama bin Laden as ''our most prominent supporter'') -- have disowned Mr. bin Laden. Another, Salman al-Awda, has excoriated him, asking, ''How many innocents have you killed?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abu Basir al-Tartusi, an influential Jordan-born cleric living in London, now uses the Islamic concept of ''covenant'' between Muslims and their hosts to condemn jihadist bombings in Britain. In Qatar, the high-profile televangelist Yusuf al-Qaradhawi has advanced a ''jurisprudence of jihad'' that forbids the killing of most civilians. And from his prison cell in Egypt, Sayyed Imam al-Sharif -- the founder of the Egyptian insurgent group that produced Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri -- has declared that the jihad against the West must be abandoned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, some of these men's arguments don't go far enough to please Western ears. But they are shaping opinion. Polling since 2001 has shown that in most Muslim-majority countries, tolerance for terrorism and support for Al Qaeda is gradually eroding. It is strongly in our interest to reinforce these trends by underscoring the terrorists' killings of civilians and our own commitment to the rule of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   An open trial will also provide a catalyst for reflection among Americans on both 9/11 and its aftermath. The years before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been thoroughly hashed out through the report of the 9/11 commission and by memoirs and histories. The eight years since, a time of unremitting warfare, has had no similar opportunity for taking stock. Regrettably, no trial can provide closure for the traumas of that day. But a judgment in New York, where the greatest suffering was inflicted, will remind us both of the narrow viciousness of the terrorists' cause and of the enduring strength of our own values.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that the prospects for success in Afghanistan are so bleak right now because former President George W. Bush failed for seven long years to invest the necessary troops, resources or attention to the war. But it is now President Obama's war, and the American people are waiting for him to explain his goals and his strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama was right to conduct a sober, systematic review of his options. We all know what happens when a president sends tens of thousands of Americans to war based on flawed information, gut reactions and gauzy notions of success. But the political reality is that the longer Mr. Obama waits, the more indecisive he seems and the more constrained his options appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has been more than eight months since Mr. Obama first announced his strategy for Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, warning Americans that, for them, the border between the two --  where Taliban and Qaeda forces have found safe haven --  is ''the most dangerous place in the world.'' And it has been more than a month since his top general in Afghanistan asked for 40,000 more troops, warning that ''failure to gain the initiative'' over the next year could make it impossible to defeat the Taliban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans are deeply anxious about the war. As the debate among his advisers has dragged on, and became increasingly public, many are asking whether the conflict is necessary or already a lost cause. Democratic leaders are among the loudest questioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has become a cliche in Washington that there are only bad choices in Afghanistan. But it seems clear that this is not the time for a precipitous withdrawal, nor can the United States cling to the status quo while the Taliban gains ever more territory and more power. To move forward, Mr. Obama needs to explain the stakes for this country, the extent of the military commitment, the likely cost in lives and treasure and his definition of success. Mr. Bush failed to do all of that in Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America's allies, many of whom are looking for a way out, also need to hear why their troops should continue to risk their lives. There is no chance in Afghanistan unless President Hamid Karzai separates himself from his corrupt associates and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders step up their fight against the Taliban and other extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama said on Wednesday that he would soon provide ''a lot of clarity'' on his Afghanistan strategy. These are some of the things the world needs to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT ARE THE STAKES? We agreed with the president in August when he described Afghanistan as a war of necessity. In a speech, he warned that if the Taliban insurgency were left unchecked it ''will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, some of his top advisers have raised doubts about the urgency and even the necessity of the war. The national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, said in October that there were ''less than 100'' Qaeda members operating in Afghanistan without bases or the ''ability to launch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on either us or our allies.'' He said he didn't ''foresee the return of the Taliban'' and that the ''next step in this is the sanctuaries'' in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Vice President Joseph Biden has been even more insistent that the real front is across the border and that attacking extremists on both sides could be better accomplished with a lighter footprint in Afghanistan and Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and special operations raids. Other officials argue that the Taliban may have learned a lesson and might be open to a deal that barred Al Qaeda from its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama needs to address these arguments -- to say whether he still considers fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan to be central to American security and why. Does he still believe a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would mean a ''larger safe haven'' for Al Qaeda? And how does he see the relationship between the war in Afghanistan and efforts to hold off extremists in a nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? If the Taliban were to win in Afghanistan, would they be less or more likely to threaten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, Mr. Obama warned that, for Afghans, a ''return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy and the denial of basic human rights,'' especially to women and girls. We need to hear whether he still believes Americans have a duty to stop that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE WAR? In March, President Obama said his goal was to ''disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.'' He also argued that bullets and bombs would not be enough to drive the Taliban back. In Afghanistan, American forces and a surge of civilian advisers must ''advance security, opportunity and justice'' for the Afghan people, ''not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given that, no one in the White House should have been surprised when Mr. Obama's chosen commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, came back with an ambitious counterinsurgency plan, although his request for 40,000 more troops was clearly higher than Mr. Obama and his aides had wanted to hear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. Obama no longer believes that a counterinsurgency is necessary or feasible, or if he wants to set less-ambitious goals (there has been talk of securing a smaller number of cities while speeding up training of the Afghan Army), then the American people need to hear why he changed his mind and how he intends to move forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama will also have to address his vice president's proposal. We share Mr. Biden's anxiety that a larger American military presence might alienate more Afghans than it wins over. But we are also skeptical that a war against Al Qaeda can be fought from a distance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and commandos still need bases, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not likely to provide them. They need ''actionable'' intelligence, which could dry up with fewer American troops on the Afghan side of the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ARE THERE CREDIBLE PARTNERS? There is almost no chance of holding off the Taliban (or plotting an eventual American withdrawal) without a minimally credible Afghan government and security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taliban's medieval ideas and brutality are anathema to most Afghans. We see that in the courage of the Afghan families who defy the Taliban by sending their daughters to school. But the corruption of the Karzai government, and its failure to provide the most basic services and security, have caused many of its citizens to decide that they have no choice but to submit to the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even after his supporters were caught trying to steal the election, Mr. Karzai remains shamelessly, insultingly undaunted. Mr. Obama must make clear to both Mr. Karzai and the American people the sweeping changes required to build a credible Afghan government. If there are other, better partners, competent cabinet members or provincial officials, then Americans need to hear how Mr. Obama plans to empower them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama should be candid about his administration's halting progress. In March, he pledged to send ''agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers'' across Afghanistan to relieve the burden on American troops and help the government ''serve its people.'' There are disturbing reports that the situation on the ground is so dangerous that many of these advisers cannot leave Kabul. It was chilling to read in The Times last week that when the ambassador in Kabul asked for additional civilian staff, the State Department turned down some of his requests because of budget constraints and a decision to cap the number at 1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There will never be enough American troops on the ground to defeat the Taliban or provide security for Afghans. Mr. Obama must explain his plans for building a minimally functional Afghan Army and police force. More trainers are needed, but as The Times reported earlier this month, even that is no guarantee of success. According to reviews by American officials, the effort has been hobbled by a high dropout rate for recruits, ''a lack of competent and professional'' Afghan leadership ''at all levels,'' widespread illiteracy and corruption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT WILL IT COST? Mr. Bush cynically tried to cover up the heavy costs of the Iraq and Afghan wars and cooked the financial books with repeated ''supplemental'' financing requests. Mr. Obama has done far better and needs to continue to tell the truth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The human cost will continue to rise if the number of forces rises. Mr. Obama should also acknowledge the cost in military readiness and the stress of repeated deployments on troops and their families. On the financial side, the Pentagon has already spent more than $150 billion on the war. While estimates are difficult, analysts say that for every 10,000 additional troops deployed, the annual cost will rise by at least another $10 billion. Americans need to hear how those costs will be met, even though the choices -- raising taxes, cutting spending or more borrowing --  are unappealing in a time of recession and high deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IS THERE A WAY OUT? Finally, Mr. Obama promised on Wednesday to outline an ''endgame.'' Given Afghanistan's desperate state, we are skeptical that he can lay out a firm timetable for withdrawal. But there are certainly benchmarks that he can offer. (Mr. Obama promised that in March, but the nation has yet to hear an accounting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There must be a way to measure progress or failure. Americans need to know the war will not go on forever. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suicide blast near the judicial complex here on Thursday killed at least 17 people and wounded more than 30 others, a senior police official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official, Sahibzada Anis, said in Peshawar that a suicide bomber had stepped out of a taxi and tried to make his way to the main gate of the courthouse complex after being stopped for a security check. When a police officer ran at the man to challenge him, the bomber detonated his charge, Mr. Anis said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three police sentries at the gate were among the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early Friday morning, another bomb went off in Peshawar. The police said a remotely controlled device destroyed a police vehicle, killing three officers and wounding six others, Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Photos of the scene of Thursday's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed documents, bicycles and bodies scattered near the gate. In an interview with a local television channel, a man who had helped in the rescue effort said that three lawyers were among those killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judicial complex is on the main Khyber Road, and the High Court and the Pearl Continental Hotel are nearby. Eleven people were killed when the hotel,  popular with aid workers and journalists, was attacked in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a war going on,'' said Bashir Bilour, a senior minister in the government of the North-West Frontier Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They can target us, even our children, but we will always stand up against them,'' he said in a television interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, the chief minister of the province, warned, ''This is not going to be the last bombing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than 300 people have died in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on government and civilian targets in the past six weeks. Most of the assaults have come in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fractious northwest. Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province, has suffered the most. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assaults are widely seen as reprisals for the Pakistani military's continuing campaign in South Waziristan against insurgents from Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for most of the bombings and have warned of further </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the one on Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It came just hours after an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by what was believed to be an American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed three militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal area along the Afghan border, intelligence officials told The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials said the missiles hit a house owned by a local tribesman in the village of Shana Khuwara in North Waziristan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should President Obama decide to send 40,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan, the most ambitious plan under consideration at the White House, the military would have enormous flexibility to deploy as many as 15,000 troops to the Taliban center of gravity in the south, 5,000 to the critical eastern border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and 10,000 as trainers for the Afghan security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rest could be deployed flexibly across the country, including to the NATO headquarters in Kabul, the capital, and in clandestine operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. Obama limited any additional American troops to 10,000 to 15,000, the military would deploy them largely as trainers, with some reinforcements likely in the southern province of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual home. The neighboring, and opium-rich, Helmand Province and the eastern border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, military analysts say, would receive few if any American troops and would remain largely as they are today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such trade-offs are part of the discussions under way in the West Wing and at the Pentagon as Mr. Obama and his top advisers debate escalating the eight-year-old war. And they drive home the basic point that while the numbers will dominate the headlines, what is really at stake is how to fight the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is a primer, culled from the diverse views of administration officials and military analysts, on the military utility of some of the force options before the president to bolster the 68,000 American troops already in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  40,000 troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In late September, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, sent three different troop options to the Pentagon: about 80,000; 40,000 or more; or 10,000 to 15,000. The White House quickly discarded the idea of sending 80,000, making his middle option the high one under consideration by the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With 40,000 troops, the military priority would be to deploy as many as 10,000 to Kandahar, the desert province abutting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; its big city, also called Kandahar, is the second largest in Afghanistan. Currently there are about 3,200 United States troops and 1,600 Canadian soldiers in the area. The Taliban control much of Kandahar Province and are contesting control of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We do not now have enough troops around Kandahar to secure this area from the enemy,'' said Kimberly Kagan, the president of the Institute for the Study of War, who over the summer was part of a team that helped General McChrystal assess the Afghan conflict for the president. Control of Kandahar, the hub of Taliban operations in the south, would be a major strategic accomplishment for the United States military and a psychological blow to the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An additional 5,000 American troops would probably be sent to the contested Helmand Province, home to the poppy crop that is a major source of income for the Taliban who traffic in opium. The province is the vital breadbasket of Afghanistan, where the river valley is a fertile ground for pomegranates, wheat and other fruits and grains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some 4,000 Marines are now in the area, but they have been unable to secure large parts of the province, including guerrilla strongholds in southern and central Helmand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet another 5,000 would probably be sent to the eastern area that some military planners refer to as ''P2K,'' for the Afghan provinces of Paktika, Paktia and Khost. The three provinces border the mountainous tribal area of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including North and South Waziristan. The Pakistani region has become a haven for the senior leadership of Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The preponderance of forces, no matter what number you pick, will be in the south, and there will be some in the east,'' said a senior defense official, who would not specify further. The relatively stable north and west, he said, ''will remain areas of an economy of force.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps as many as 10,000 troops would be deployed as trainers with the Afghan security forces, with NATO pledging to send thousands more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  20,000 to 35,000 troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This way encompasses a number of mid-range options under discussion at the Pentagon and the White House. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates; Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have coalesced around a plan to send 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan, although there are variations in their positions and they are not working in lock step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The difference between 30,000 and 40,000, military analysts say, is that there might be 5,000 trainers rather than 10,000, and fewer troops to spread flexibly across the country over all, although there would still be a strong concentration in the south. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kandahar is pretty crucial, and we should not skimp there,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a national security expert at the Brookings Institution who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials say that the additional troops would also be deployed to protect some dozen population clusters across the country, including not only Kandahar and Kabul but also Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north, Herat in the west and Jalalabad in the east. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officials say that three-quarters of any additional troops sent, no matter the number, will be working side by side with Afghan security forces in a ''partnering'' or apprentice arrangement. They will be separate from American trainers, whose job is to put raw recruits through a basic military training regime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the partnering arrangement, Afghan troops will share the same bases as the Americans, a defense official said, and although there will be separate sleeping quarters and dining facilities, ''they're going to live together, work together, plan together and operate together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Should Mr. Obama send 20,000 troops, military analysts say, there would probably be no fourth brigade to use around the country, and parts of Helmand and the east would receive few if any additional troops. With this number, Mr. Obama would expect a greater contribution of troops from NATO allies (about 35,000 troops from other NATO countries are currently in Afghanistan). Much of the American mission would focus on training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials estimate the cost of sending 30,000 more troops at $25 billion to $30 billion a year and the cost of sending 20,000 troops at $21 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10,000 to 15,000 troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under this approach, advocated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the United States would accelerate the training of the Afghan security forces and focus on eliminating the Qaeda leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama is likely to announce his new Afghanistan strategy in the first week of December, administration officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the attention to the troop number, Anthony H. Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that it would be about as helpful to understanding the president's war strategy as counting the number of parts in a Ferrari to determine how it would handle the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Vice President Biden travels to Iraq, which he does every two months or so, he flies on Air Force Two to an airbase in southern England and then transfers to a cargo plane, a C-17, retrofitted for vice-presidential comfort with an Airstream trailer bolted on to tracks in the center of the hold. With its porthole and shiny rivets and gleaming chrome, this strange conveyance looks like something out of Jules Verne. Captain Biden holds court in a wood-paneled galley just large enough for his half-dozen or so aides to pile into. Unlike Nemo, he is a gregarious knee-squeezer who has to be ordered by his staff to stop talking so he can get some rest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I had the first of several long conversations with Biden in the Airstream this summer on his return from his first trip to Iraq as vice president. With violence much reduced and some signs of political reconciliation, Iraq had suddenly switched places with Afghanistan to become the war we ignore; but Obama-administration officials feared that Iraq would sink back into fratricide unless Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds made the painful compromises they had avoided so far. President Obama had committed to ending America's combat role in the country by Aug. 31, 2010; though both the American and Iraqi publics demanded the withdrawal, it endangered Iraq's very fragile security and reduced American leverage at a crucial moment of political transition. Early last June, the president asked Biden to take responsibility for Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the course of a two-day trip to Baghdad, Biden met with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other leading political figures. Officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations had come to view Maliki as a sectarian Shiite bent on marginalizing Iraq's Sunni minority. ''You've never heard me prior to this trip singing the praises of Maliki,'' Biden said. He had changed into his Airstream mufti -- short-sleeve knit shirt and natty dark slacks. He is impressively trim for a 67-year-old, especially one scarcely known for self-discipline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden said he had been having second thoughts about Maliki. In March of last year, the prime minister sent troops to suppress the forces of Moktada al-Sadr and the militias that controlled the southern city of Basra -- Shiites in both cases. He had alienated parts of his base and launched an appeal across sectarian lines. ''He's got a real problem,'' Biden said, following this new train of thought, ''and if he wants to stay in power'' -- an election is looming next year -- ''how does he do it?'' He needed to assemble a winning coalition. Would he seek Kurdish support? Sunni support? Both? But how, given that the Kurds and Sunnis were at each other's throats? ''These guys put their pants on one leg at a time,'' Biden said. ''They're still politicians.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here was a Joe Biden guiding principle. Unlike Obama, Biden has spent virtually his entire life in politics. It is his medium: he talks about world leaders the way a grizzled baseball coach talks about the opposing lineup. I once heard him say, ''Foreign policy is like human relations, only people know less about each other.'' One of the chief reasons that Obama has sought Biden's advice on a range of pressing foreign-policy questions -- most notably, in recent months, on policy in Afghanistan -- is that Biden has a deep knowledge of, and an intuitive feel for, people and places still new to the president. He appears to have judged right on Iraq, where the coming elections should constitute a major success both for the Iraqis and for the Obama administration. But that's only if they actually occur. Iraqi leaders may still choose sectarian over national interest no matter the consequences -- and they've shown signs of doing just that. Politics are not, alas, the same all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS SENATORS, BARACK OBAMA and Joe Biden were far from close. Obama served on the Foreign Relations Committee, which Biden led; and Biden, who felt that he had earned his stars the old-fashioned way, bristled at Obama's status as instant superstar. ''They started out pretty far apart,'' a Biden aide says. They went on to run against each other for the Democratic nomination for the presidency; before Biden dropped out of the race he criticized Obama as a foreign-policy neophyte who was copying his ideas. Brian Katulis, a national-security expert at the Center for American Progress, recalls encountering Biden wandering around the executive-suite floor in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad late one night in February 2008, looking for someone to talk to. Biden invited Katulis and a visiting former congressman down to the hotel restaurant for a milkshake, and then delivered a 90-minute monologue, the essence of which was: ''I know more about foreign policy than any of the other candidates in the race, and I'm going to devote the next six months to rewriting Democratic foreign policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden said he believed -- and still believes -- that he would make a very good president. He was nervous about accepting Obama's offer of the vice presidency, fearing that he would suffer a loss in status, and in voice, from his role as a Senate baron. According to John Podesta, a former official in the Clinton White House who ran Obama's transition, Biden ''had a fairly clear sense in his own mind, which probably existed even before he was selected by Obama but definitely in the weeks in advance of and right after the election, that he didn't want to be the guy in charge of x portfolio.'' Instead, Biden wanted the role every vice president wants, but which perhaps only his predecessor, Dick Cheney, had enjoyed: to be the last voice in the room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president and the vice president are very different men both temperamentally and generationally, and they move in different social circles. ''Everyone wants this to be some kind of buddy movie -- 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' '' as one senior White House official, who asked not to be named so he could speak freely, put it. ''Presidents and vice presidents are never close friends. It's a working relationship; it's more like the C.E.O. and the chairman of the board.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet, on foreign policy, Biden has largely realized his wish to be the president's all-purpose adviser and sage. He attends the president's daily briefing every morning with James L. Jones, the national-security adviser; often Biden will stay behind for a few minutes to raise other issues. He has a weekly lunch with the president and no staff members. He sits in on most of the ''principals' meetings'' of top national-security officials, which occur about once a week; unlike Cheney, a silent presence at these sessions, Biden has plenty to say. Biden attends every important meeting on foreign policy the president holds. ''It's me and him, and the cast of characters changes a little bit,'' Biden told me not long ago during a conversation in his White House office. ''I have the benefit of watching him react, and him watching me react. Very seldom a week goes by that he doesn't call me down to his office, or wander in here and close the door and say, 'Wait a minute, what about this?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Empire-building is not encouraged in the Obama administration. Biden has five aides who focus on foreign affairs, a large number save in comparison to Cheney, who had more than a dozen. No vice president had ever sought, or gained, the autonomy, or the supremacy over other power centers, that President Bush granted to Cheney. ''He was his own separate branch of government,'' as Ron Klain, Biden's chief of staff, puts it. ''He took the office of the vice president out of the White House phone directory, and out of the White House budget.'' Biden is seeking to ''normalize'' that relationship, Klain says. At the same time, people around Biden point out that he benefits from Cheney's self-aggrandizement: Biden can reduce the scope of the office to something like its historic dimensions and still be the second-most powerful vice president in history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while Cheney's staff fought for dominance with the White House, Biden's is deeply enmeshed in the policy-making structure. His national-security adviser, Antony J. Blinken, and two other aides are also directors in the National Security Council, while a number of former Biden aides occupy important posts in the N.S.C. Thomas Donilon, deputy national-security adviser and coordinator of policy across agencies, has been a close friend of Biden's since the 1980s; Donilon's brother, Michael, is a senior adviser to Biden, and Donilon's wife, Catherine Russell, was Biden's former administrative assistant and is now chief of staff to Biden's wife, Jill. During the transition, Biden told James Jones that he didn't want his own N.S.C. but wanted to be able to call on the N.S.C. as needed. Jones complied; on the first day in office, he told his staff, ''You work for the president and the vice president.'' National-security aides routinely accompany Biden on his foreign trips. As one policymaker who was not authorized to comment publicly on internal administration issues said to me: ''I don't in my head distinguish between Office of the Vice President people and N.S.C. people. We're all the White House staff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Biden's early assignments from Obama was to adjudicate any disputes among the so-called team of rivals. Biden, as he himself points out, knew all of them longer than they did one another (or than the president did). Biden has breakfast with Hillary Clinton every Tuesday, meets with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about once a week and speaks constantly to James Jones. He was called on to mediate a dispute over turf between Leon Panetta, the director of the C.I.A., and Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence. Otherwise, the outward appearance of intramural harmony seems to correspond to reality. ''I assure you,'' Biden said to me, ''among the principals there is a respect that I haven't seen, because I think everybody, if not all on the same hymnal, they're all on the same book. We don't have one of those San Andreas faults'' -- like the Bush administration had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The difference between Biden's role and Cheney's has at least as much to do with the culture of the two administrations as it does with the men themselves. Bush's discomfort with world affairs created a vacuum that Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others fought to fill. Moreover, Bush's tendency toward the snap judgment and the gut call undermined the formal policy process in favor of jockeying for position at key moments. By contrast, there is little question where foreign policy is now decided -- in the Oval Office -- and the absence of a San Andreas fault line has as much to do with clarity of authority as it does with personal vibes. What's more, as the agonizingly deliberative debate over policy in Afghanistan has demonstrated, Obama wants to hear a case fully argued out before reaching a conclusion, even at some political risk. This perfectly suits Biden, a gifted expostulator and an indifferent schemer. On a wide range of issues, says James Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, Obama ''knows that he can turn to Joe and say, 'How are these people going to react, what are they going to say, how are they going to see it, what's going to be in their mind?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE INCOMING OBAMA national-security team believed that Iraq had constituted such an ''intellectual-capital suck,'' as one official put it, that other global problems had been allowed to fester. An early review persuaded State Department officials that the Balkans, where terrible wars were fought, and uneasily settled, in the 1990s, was one such problem. ''We needed someone to go over there,'' says one official who was not authorized to speak on the record, ''and say we care, we're interested, at a very high level.'' Steinberg, who worked extensively on the issue in the Clinton era, was an obvious candidate; but Biden enjoyed enormous credibility in Bosnia and Kosovo, where as a senator he advocated military intervention in the face of Serbian aggression. And he was the vice president. Biden traveled to the region in mid-May. Invited to address the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the vice president warned that if growing ethnic tensions weren't reduced, Bosnia would be kept out of the European Union and thus remain locked in poverty and might well ''descend into ethnic chaos that defined your country for the better part of a decade.'' (Steinberg says Biden's rude jolt has ''gotten the parties back talking to each other'' but concedes that ''whether we get them over the hurdles remains to be seen.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden, who would later make similar visits to Lebanon, Georgia and Ukraine, was becoming Obama's fire chief and ambassador without portfolio. These trips were one-time-only events. Iraq, however, was different. In its early months, the Obama administration arguably reversed the Bush mistake and started ignoring Iraq in favor of Afghanistan. Iraq had no special envoy and, for a portion of the spring, not even an ambassador. At a national-security meeting in early June, where discussion centered on the potential dangers of the impending drawdown of troops, Obama turned to Biden and said, as Biden recalls, ''Joe, you do Iraq.'' Biden says he was so surprised that at first he thought the president was kidding. In fact, the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, says it was his idea. ''I've known the vice president for a long time,'' Emanuel told me. ''He has everything -- gravitas, political smarts, the confidence of the players and knowledge of the issues. At the end of the day, this is a political process, and you need a politician to work on the process. And he has the authority of the White House.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emanuel also had the bright idea of sending Biden to Iraq for a July 4 photo op with the troops. The optics were everything the White House could have hoped for. Biden traveled to Al Faw Palace, a gigantesque Saddam Hussein-era structure once used for Baath Party functions, in order to administer the oath of American citizenship to 237 soldiers who had joined the military as immigrants. It was quite a sight -- crisp ranks of African and Asian and Latino men and women lined up beneath a giant American flag hanging from the ceiling. Hussein was very fond of chandeliers; and from the lofty, tiled dome of Al Faw hung a mighty crystal chandelier orbited by little chandelier-moons, as perhaps lesser potentates were thought to orbit around Hussein. Except that it was all a fake: a soldier stationed at the palace told me that the chandelier was largely plastic and the gold fixtures were made of brass. The kingdom we had conquered was a stage set; now it was our stage set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden loves a stage, and he loves all-American hokum. ''As corny as it sounds,'' he said, after Raymond T. Odierno, the commanding general in Iraq, addressed the troops, ''damn, I'm proud to be an American.'' He told a story about being driven to Camp Bondsteel, the home of American peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, and seeing, standing together, ''a female colonel, a black captain, a white sergeant and, literally, a Hispanic private.'' Turning to his Kosovar driver, he said: ''That's America. And until you understand that here, you'll never be free.'' After the Al Faw speech, Biden was taken to the DFAC -- dining facility -- in Baghdad's International Zone (informally known as the Green Zone), where he met with the Delaware National Guard unit with which his son Beau served. Then he entered the cafeteria for a meet and greet. He lit up like a 1,000-watt bulb. Biden shook every hand, and threw his arm around every shoulder -- hundreds and hundreds of them. ''How are you, man?'' he cried, with fresh joy, to each table of soldiers. ''Did you get a picture of me?'' A soldier said politely, ''Look this way, sir,'' and Biden, who has the blinding white teeth of a starlet, whirled around with a huge smile. The vice president never stopped moving, smiling or talking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden's goal for this first trip was to reassure Iraq's leaders that Washington had not dropped their country in favor of Afghanistan, and to press them to reach agreement on a wide range of constitutional and political issues that had remained blocked for years -- an agreement on oil revenues and sales, a formula for sharing power and resources between Baghdad and the provinces and the resolution of the border dispute between Arab Iraq and Kurdistan, especially involving the status of the Kirkuk region. Biden was determinedly upbeat, pointing out to the traveling press, jammed into his wood-paneled Airstream, that the phased American withdrawal was not leading to the bloodbath many predicted. ''The Iraqis,'' he said, ''have become invested in their nationhood.'' It was true that recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Sunni extremists had not provoked sectarian violence, as had been the case in 2006. But tensions between Arabs and Kurds had grown only worse. There was no sign of progress on the status of Kirkuk, which Kurds considered integral to their identity but which large populations of Arabs and Turkmen also claimed as their own. The 8.5 billion barrels of oil reserves estimated to be beneath Kirkuk made it a prize no one was willing to yield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden knows a lot about Iraq, but his judgment has scarcely been perfect in the past. He opposed the first gulf war, voted to authorize the 2003 invasion and opposed the surge. ''When was the last time Biden was right about anything?'' the military writer Thomas E. Ricks asked in his blog earlier this fall, apropos of Biden's current views on Afghanistan. Like many senior Democrats, Biden was an uneasy and equivocal supporter of the 2003 war. He now says that, at the time, he didn't think the war was really ''worth the candle.'' In 2002 he convened hearings that focused attention on the enormous challenges that would come after a military victory -- challenges the Bush administration went on to treat with stunning nonchalance. He and Senator Richard Lugar submitted a measure that would have required the Bush administration to either get explicit authorization for war from the U.N. Security Council or to stipulate to Congress that Iraq posed an ''imminent threat'' to U.S. security. When this effort collapsed, Biden voted to give Bush the authority to go to war without such restrictions. When I asked Biden if he felt, in retrospect, that he had made a mistake, he said: ''To the extent that I made a mistake about the war it was, I trusted what I was being told by Bush personally. And I trusted that he in fact was not buying into the neocon argument.'' The president had acted circumspectly in Afghanistan. Biden says he believed Bush when he said he wanted to return weapons inspectors to Iraq. It may also be that, like other liberal Democrats -- especially those who voted against the first gulf war in 1991 -- Biden did not feel that he could afford to fly with the doves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AS A SENATOR, Biden did not give countries the once-over lightly, as most legislators do; he typically traveled with a colleague -- usually Chuck Hagel, in the case of Iraq -- and stayed for four or five days. Very few legislators, if any, could match his knowledge of people and places. On Iraq, Biden argued from the outset that the U.S. needed more troops, more civilians, more focus on politics and the long term. He did not, of course, make much headway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as growing sectarian violence reduced the Bush administration's dream of a democratic Iraq to ashes, Biden began to have second, or third, thoughts. In May 2006, he and Leslie H. Gelb, an old friend who is a former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, co-wrote an Op-Ed in this newspaper arguing that conflict among the major groups would inevitably frustrate designs for a centralized Iraqi state, and suggesting instead a Bosnia-type solution with three ''largely autonomous'' regions and a central government with functions limited to ''border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues.'' Rather than staying forever or withdrawing precipitately, U.S. forces would leave Iraq by 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The idea was unfamiliar and had no constituency. ''I don't know anyone else in politics who would do that,'' Gelb told me. The proposal was flatly rejected by the dominant Shiites, who had no wish to dilute their power; the 2006 Iraq Study Group suggested that the plan could starve the Sunnis of economic resources. Scholars and policymakers asserted that the war in Bosnia, unlike the war in Iraq, ended with the three groups largely sorted into their own regions. The plan got little traction. Some who thought the proposal was flawed nevertheless admired Biden for making it. Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution who has been more hawkish on the war than Biden, says, ''When much of the rest of the country was taking sides -- 'Are you for it or against it?' -- Biden said, 'Neither -- the current strategy isn't working, and here's my alternative.' '' O'Hanlon adds that Biden ''was remarkably and admirably nonpartisan through '04, '05, '06, as we were trying to sort out if we had any hope in Iraq.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 2007, however, Biden was running for president, and he sounded more like a highly partisan candidate than a dispassionate statesman. He asserted that Gen. David Petraeus, the author of the surge in Iraq, was ''dead, flat wrong,'' and that only a political solution based on his federalism plan could allow us to leave behind a stable Iraq. (Though Biden won't quite admit it, the success of the surge has made a radical devolution of power unnecessary.) He argued that the greatest danger to America came from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rather than Iraq. He advocated strong action to prevent further atrocities in Sudan, including the imposition of a no-fly zone. And he argued, in general, that he understood the world better than any of his opponents did. Voters were not sufficiently impressed: Biden ended his campaign after the Iowa caucuses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Biden was in Baghdad, Prime Minister Maliki's spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, pointedly noted that the constitutional concerns Biden hoped to advance are ''internal issues that Iraqis will handle.'' Maliki himself had been similarly standoffish, at least in public. But Iraqi officials were eager to use Biden as a go-between and advocate. Maliki gave his blessing to a proposal that Biden press Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, to postpone plans to hold a referendum on the Kurdish Constitution, which would have unilaterally absorbed Kirkuk. But a sandstorm, freakish even by Iraqi standards, prevented Biden from traveling to Kurdistan's capital city, Erbil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As soon as he returned to Washington, though, Biden hit the phones. He spoke regularly to Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and to General Odierno, the commander of American-led forces, as well as to Maliki, Barzani and other leadership figures. Biden pressed Maliki to carry through on plans to visit Kurdistan, and he pressed Barzani to postpone the referendum. He asked each man to stop describing the other as an enemy of peace. And those things did happen. A senior White House official says that Biden's influence was crucial both in persuading Maliki to make the trip and in postponing the referendum. The Iraqis, on the other hand, take a more skeptical view of the American role. Sadiq al-Rikabi, Maliki's political adviser, told me that the prime minister was simply responding to an invitation from Iraq's president, while Barzani's chief of staff, Fuad Hussein, ascribed the voting delay to ''technical'' issues. But Qubad Talabani, the representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government to the U.S., says Biden told Barzani it would be ''unhelpful'' if the Kurds held their referendum -- ''and we knew what that meant.'' It meant that Arab outrage at the Kurdish annexation of Kirkuk could increase ethnic violence. Talabani gives Biden significant credit for helping to move the process forward. Biden, says Talabani, ''is keeping us all honest and actually delivering results.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  iden's role as vice president is not, of course, limited to foreign policy. Though his chief persona in global affairs is He Who Knows All World Leaders, in domestic affairs and the economy -- subjects that never much interested him -- he is regular Joe from working-class Delaware (and Pennsylvania, initially). The campaign often exploited his lunch-bucket cred to balance Obama's lofty Harvard Yard aura on pocketbook issues. One of his jobs as vice president has been to make the public argument for Obama's economic stimulus efforts. Biden is also the administration's senior ambassador to the Senate. He regularly works out at the Senate gym, where he gets in as much schmoozing as exercise. His closest friends include current and former senators like Chuck Hagel and Christopher Dodd. He ended one of our conversations in order to make calls to the Senate on health care reform. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, told me Biden lobbied him and other members of the G.O.P. on the Kerry-Lugar bill mandating aid to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden's former colleagues speak fondly of him, though they acknowledge his reputation as a windbag. ''You can't help but like Joe,'' as Graham puts it. Biden's vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the rarefied standards of the U.S. Senate: in his telling, the room is always falling silent as he confronts his listeners with the killer insight. Unlike his boss, Biden is not a particularly self-conscious person. I once heard him tell a very long anecdote -- a very good anecdote, to be sure -- in exactly the same words as he had told it to exactly the same audience about 36 hours earlier. His audience -- reporters and aides on the C-17 -- struggled to keep an expression of rapt attention on their faces, and to laugh at the places they had laughed the day before. Biden noticed nothing. You have the feeling that he has been spared the normal human allotment of reproach. But neither does he reproach others: Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself. One of his former aides -- Washington is rife with them -- told me that she had learned an important life lesson from her boss: ''Question people's judgment, not their motives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden has, it is true, occasionally provoked the famously disciplined president with his unscheduled rhetorical flights. After Biden ventured that administration policies had a ''30 percent'' chance of failure, Obama said at a press conference, ''You know, I don't remember what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly.'' The White House was even more taken aback when, on his way home from Ukraine and Georgia, Biden told a reporter that Russia, facing historic decline, was ''clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable.'' Obama called Biden and said, ''What was that about?'' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to walk that one back on ''Meet the Press.'' Nonetheless, you can see Biden making the very visible effort to bite his tongue in public. And in White House deliberations he is said to have curbed his epic prolixity. ''He's much more disciplined now,'' John Podesta says. ''He speaks less; he waits until the end.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president and vice president tend to reach the same conclusions, if by different paths. In Biden's worldview, which seems to be composed equally of temperament, experience and books, principles are very important as beacons, but they are dangerous, and often delusory, as direct guides to action. He shares with Obama a deep skepticism about wished-for outcomes, which makes him wary about conventional liberalism. He ran for the Senate in 1972 as an opponent of the war in Vietnam, but he says, ''I wasn't against the war for moral reasons; I just thought it was a stupid policy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden consumes policy books and loves nothing more than policy debate, but he is no more a theoretician or an ideologue than most politicians. On domestic policy, Biden has been a moderate liberal, favoring gun control and abortion rights, though also the Patriot Act and a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. On global affairs, Les Gelb calls him ''a classic moderate American pragmatist,'' applying broad principle but looking at each situation on its merits. Biden was an outspoken advocate of bombing Serbia to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, but he was at least as concerned about instability spreading toward Central Europe as he was about ending atrocities. And it was doable: ''It was within our wheelhouse,'' as Biden puts it. Ending atrocities in, say, Somalia, was not. Nor was democratizing the Arab world by invading Iraq and replacing Saddam Hussein with a leader of our choosing. Biden's constant criticism of the Bush administration's policies in Iraq was not that they were immoral but that they, like Nixon's in Vietnam, were unrealistic. '' 'The road to peace in the Middle East is through Baghdad' -- we never bought any of that,'' he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden says he used to meet regularly -- ''because we disagreed so much'' -- with Robert Kagan, the neoconservative champion of democracy promotion. Biden mocks the idea that ''you can actually impose democracy'' because ''the yearning masses, yearning to be free and democratic'' will ''just embrace it.'' Experience, he says, argues otherwise. At the same time, Biden refuses to accept the supposed choice between moralism and realism that, he says, dictates that in the face of authoritarian states like Russia or China, ''you either decry the behavior and cut off relations, or you ignore the behavior and enhance your relations.'' The Obama administration, especially in regard to Russia, Biden says, has chosen a third option: ''You make it clear to the country in question, We don't approve of the behavior in question. We can't do anything about it, but don't expect us'' to acquiesce ''if the only way you'll trade with us is if we say it's O.K. you're beating the hell out of those folks in Tiananmen Square.''  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a past supporter of movements for democracy and self-determination in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Georgia and Kurdistan, Biden does not have to defend his antiauthoritarian credentials; but the Obama administration itself, despite the president's occasional soaring rhetoric, has come in for some heavy weather from liberals for its reluctance to criticize autocratic allies like Egypt, or to condition aid on democratic reform, as the Bush administration did (albeit with little success). One consequence of Biden's view may be that authoritarian states have to endure some fairly gentle admonitions while having their way on major issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is a view that Obama's team is divided between what Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation and The Washington Note, a leading foreign-policy blog, calls ''progressive realists'' like James Steinberg and ''Democratic neocons'' -- that is, moralists -- like Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the U.N. The hard-headed Biden, Clemons says, ''can play in both those games.'' But this classification scheme explains only so much. It may be more useful to say that this president is pulled both toward the grand project -- as in the campaign to eliminate nuclear weapons -- and toward the chastened recalibration, as evident in the reined-in language on democracy promotion. The tension falls between the extreme ambitiousness of the goals and the caution required to achieve them -- a sense of prudence born in no small part of the failure of George W. Bush's transformative schemes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IT IS PRECISELY this tension that has made the debate over Afghanistan so prolonged and difficult. The president called Afghanistan ''a war of necessity'' as recently as August. Iraq was George W. Bush's war of necessity; and for Bush that meant authorizing the war and worrying about the consequences later -- or perhaps closing his eyes to the consequences. But Obama and his circle of advisers have been bedeviled by doubts about whether the ambitious nationwide counterinsurgency program proposed by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and David Petraeus, head of Central Command, can actually work. And here Biden's hard-earned skepticism, his knowledge of the region, his zest for verbal combat and the trust that Obama now reposes in him have allowed him to play a major role in recasting the terms of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden was an original believer in the epic project of nation-building in Afghanistan. ''Whatever it takes, we should do it,'' he said soon after the Taliban government in Kabul was toppled in 2001. He subsequently accused the Bush administration of ignoring Afghanistan, the source of the Qaeda threat, in favor of Iraq. He opposed the surge in Iraq in part because he favored one in Afghanistan. But Biden began to have second thoughts about Afghanistan, as he had about Iraq. As Taliban victories grew, heroin production increased and reports of high-level corruption grew ever more baroque, Biden began to lose faith in Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, and in the nation-building project itself. A trip to Afghanistan in the weeks before the new administration took office persuaded Biden that the U.S. military had no clear plan for victory. In the ensuing internal debate over so-called AfPak policy, Biden argued for a narrow definition of success -- suppressing Al Qaeda -- and no new troops. He lost. Obama added 21,000 new troops; and though he adopted the narrowed goal Biden favored, the new policy asserted that a broad nation-building enterprise would be needed even for this more modest goal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked Biden about Afghanistan when we were in his White House office, with its Colonial blue walls and paintings of Jefferson and Adams and its rather truncated view of the Executive Office Building. (His Senate office, he says, was much nicer.) We were seated in armchairs at oblique angles to each other. Biden is a warm man -- an ardent man -- who is always trying to dispose of the space between himself and his audience. He cannot talk without making contact; I noticed once or twice that he made a swoop in the direction of my shoe before making do with my knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afghanistan required maximal contact, and the vice president, in an athletic gesture, bent all the way over to tap my toe before wheeling around to face me directly. ''When you're talking about a country which has an 85 percent rate of illiteracy, which has virtually no history of modern governance, you should go in with an overwhelming dose of humility,'' he told me. ''And you'd better damn well have as precise a notion as you can of what your objective is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the outset of his tenure as vice president, Biden had come to view himself as the one who asked the unpleasant and searching question -- who ''upset the apple cart,'' as he put it. In the debate over Afghanistan, he initially faced a near-consensus in favor of the view advanced by the generals. McChrystal offered three options, which boiled down to way more troops than he could get (80,000), enough troops (40,000), and failure (10,000 trainers but no new combat troops). Obama encouraged Biden to push the advocates to defend their arguments and justify their assumptions. Biden proceeded to do just that, especially with the brass; he proposed an alternative plan that focused less on defeating the Taliban and more on eliminating Al Qaeda. Obama reacted to this very different view by asking James Jones to present four options with different strategies, and troop levels appropriate to those strategies. When I asked Rahm Emanuel about Biden's role in the discussions, he said: ''People were thinking about certain things, but hadn't expressed them. The vice president was expressing them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden was not willing to discuss on the record the advice he gave the president while the decision remained outstanding, but the outlines of his views may be gleaned from news reports and White House interviews. Biden and those around him do not seem to believe that McChrystal's strategy can work -- not because they question the abilities of the military, but because they think the generals are far too optimistic about the civilian elements upon which the overall plan depends. They are deeply skeptical that the government of President Hamid Karzai can somehow gain legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people; that the U.S. can quickly develop the enormous civilian capacity that would accompany a military surge, or can train as many as 400,000 Afghan soldiers, especially with attrition rates now running around 25 percent; that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will accept a policy designed to bolster Afghanistan's Pashtun-led government; that NATO allies will overcome public resistance to offer major help; or that the U.S. can afford to spend something like $250 billion on Afghanistan at a time when deficits are already running very high. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Biden does not view the Taliban as synonymous with Al Qaeda and does not appear to believe that it would be a calamity if the Taliban increased its presence in the Afghan countryside (though he is not prepared to see Kabul or other major urban centers fall). If Al Qaeda can be bottled up on the border with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through counterterrorism measures involving troops as well as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the help of an expanded Afghan army, then it is unnecessary to build a secure Afghanistan that can defeat the Taliban. And then you could focus instead on the greater danger -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''I'm going to ask you a question,'' Biden said. ''If I said to you right now, We can send $30 billion a year to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or $30 billion to Afghanistan, which would you pick? Every goddamn person says, '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.' So I say, 'O.K., guys, we should be talking about a PakAf policy, not an AfPak policy.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a thoroughly plausible proposition -- if, and only if, ceding much of Afghanistan to the Taliban would not be a calamity. Among those who believe that it would be are Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, most Republican senators and experts like Bruce Riedel, who has said that it is ''a fairy tale'' to think that Al Qaeda will not return to Afghanistan along with a resurgent Taliban. Those who favor a larger military presence in Afghanistan accept the validity of Biden's concerns but do not view them as insurmountable. Biden is very likely to once again lose the debate on troop strength, though he may win on narrowing the objectives. The real test of his success will be whether the new policy tilts toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BY THE TIME Biden returned to Iraq, in mid-September, some of the seeds he planted earlier had begun to sprout. Maliki had made his good-will trip to Kurdistan; Barzani was not describing Maliki as the reincarnation of Saddam Hussein quite as regularly as before. With the election approaching, Maliki and other leaders were crossing sectarian lines to assemble winning coalitions. All talk of constitutional reform was delayed until after the election. Biden, recognizing this, backed off on these issues, focusing instead on the need to agree on an election law as soon as possible in order to ensure that the election could take place on time. In his public remarks, he asserted that the country's leaders understood that ''the election coming off on Jan. 16 is critical to Iraq's future.'' But despite all the fine rhetoric, top Iraqi officials could not agree on an election law, just as they could not agree on almost any other difficult question. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This time Biden was able to fly from Baghdad to Erbil. Baghdad, even now, is an extremely tense place. As soon as we landed in Erbil, however, an official from the Department of Foreign Relations chattered away about the luxury villas at the ''Dream City'' complex, the new cafes and restaurants, a racetrack and go-kart center. Christians were fleeing Arab Iraq for ecumenical Kurdistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Kurds are very hard to refuse. Kurdistan is a free-market democracy in a part of the world that has very little of either marketplace or democracy. The Kurds suffered terribly at the hands of Saddam Hussein -- as they are quick to remind the visitor. Biden told me that the Kurds were not yet prepared to make the concessions over Kirkuk that they would have to make, but that he understood why. ''The first thing I remember is when we drove into Erbil to meet with the Kurds,'' he said, referring to a 2002 trip. '' 'Senator, you understand what every Kurdish child learns is: The mountains are our only friend.' This sense of victimization has a historical basis. This is the Poland of the Middle East.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And yet Biden understood very well that the Kurds had to be moved off their maximalist position. When Iraqis passed a constitution in 2005, they sidestepped the intractable problem of drawing borders between Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq, and of the status of Kirkuk, by including Article 140, which called for a national census whose chief goal would be to determine the proportion of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen in the region. The census would be followed by a referendum on Kirkuk, to be held no later than the end of 2007. But because the Kurds would plainly win the referendum -- especially after bringing hundreds of thousands of their countrymen back to the region, in effect reversing Hussein's own demographic engineering -- it had proved impossible to hold the census. Kurdish representatives in Iraq's Parliament, frustrated by the delay, exacted their revenge by holding up virtually every piece of crucial national legislation. And then the Kurdish regional government passed its own constitution laying claim to all of Kirkuk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Kurds had to be persuaded to accept half a loaf: shared jurisdiction over Kirkuk, the loss of some rural areas now claimed as Kurdish. But the Kurds would have none of it. When I said to Fuad Hussein, President Barzani's chief of staff, that the dispute over Article 140 seemed to have paralyzed Iraq, he shot back, ''It is exactly on the contrary: Iraq is paralyzed because there isn't the will to implement the constitution.'' Biden, it was true, had a lot of credit with the Kurds. In late 2002, as war fever was building in Washington, he and Chuck Hagel were driven through the night from Turkey to the Kurdish capital, Erbil. Biden addressed the Kurdish Parliament and made the Kurds' cause his own. When I asked Barham Salih, the Kurdish prime minister, about Biden, he said, ''We trust him as a friend, and as someone who has been aware of the Kurdish predicament for some time.'' But, he added, ''Biden is not going to convince the Kurds to abandon what are fundamental interests.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Kurds were deeply dug in. ''Barzani is mercurial,'' said a foreign diplomat who was not authorized to speak on the record. ''Nobody looks him in the eye and says, 'You guys are heading for disaster.' We need the Americans to tell the Kurds that some of their goals are so maximalist that even their iteration is a problem for us.'' Specifically, Biden needed to persuade the Kurds that a political agreement acceptable to Arabs as well as Kurds had to come first, and only then could a referendum be held. And with violence growing along the ''trigger line'' separating Kurdish and Arab territory, it wasn't clear how long the issue could wait. When I asked the diplomat if the current situation was likely to degenerate into large-scale violence, he said: ''On balance, no. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How far would the Kurds go? The United States would not support Barzani if he insisted on a referendum either on Article 140 or on the Kurdish Constitution. And Barzani's leverage may never be greater than it is now, when American troops continue to help police the trigger line, and when Sunni and Shiite political leaders must court the Kurds to achieve an electoral majority. Biden is almost certain to be making these arguments to Barzani. If he has, however, the Kurdish leaders I spoke to seem not to have heard the news. Middle East experts maintain that the problems of borders, and of Kirkuk, constitute the single gravest threat to Iraq's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ONCE AGAIN, MUCH of the key action took place after Biden returned home. The Iraqis remained deadlocked over the electoral law for weeks, with the election itself hanging in the balance. The stumbling block was Kirkuk: Barzani wanted to use the 2009 electoral rolls, reflecting the influx of Kurds. Arab leaders wanted to use data from 2004. The issue finally came to a head earlier this month. Biden was going back and forth on the phone between Maliki and Barzani, conducting what he calls his ''condensed, truncated version of shuttle diplomacy.'' Antony Blinken says Biden and his team ''were in contact in real time.'' Over the course of a very long weekend, Blinken told me wonderingly, ''different groups were caucusing, making quorums, going out of the room, coming up with new positions. It was democracy in action.'' And by Sunday evening, the Arabs and Kurds had reached a compromise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then, two weeks later, the compact was upended when Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni, surprised Americans and Iraqis alike by vetoing the electoral law over a provision that he felt would suppress Sunni representation in Iraq's Parliament. This was the same Vice President al-Hashemi who told me, during a conversation in his Baghdad office in September, that the Iraqi people were fed up with the politics of sectarian rivalry, and then declared that the coalition he was forming would advance ''a national agenda which is nonsectarian and nonethnic.'' It's not easy to leave behind deeply ingrained habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iraq is a long way from being a functioning democracy; it's a long way from being a functioning state. The danger of Kurdistan still looms. The country may well vindicate Biden's skepticism about America's ability to shape outcomes abroad. But some Iraqis give him credit for avoiding the mistakes of the past. ''This is exactly what the U.S. needs to be doing today -- helping us reach compromise, not dictating what the compromise should be,'' says Qubad Talabani, the Kurdish regional government's representative. ''It's a model for American engagement in Iraq today.'' Our experience in both Iraq and Afghanistan has offered painful proof that we cannot simply bring refractory states to heel, no matter how much force we bring to bear. We cannot dictate outcomes. We will have to be more patient, more humble and perhaps smarter than we have been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Patient and humble are not words that come to mind when you think of Joe Biden; yet even his limitations may suit him for this new world. Biden is the one who knows many little things but no big thing. As gifted as he is at retail politics, he has none of Barack Obama's talent for the sweeping formulation or inspirational language, which perhaps explains why he has fared so poorly in presidential campaigns. Biden does not project even slightly in the realm of myth. But for this very reason, he is allergic to magical, wish-fulfillment thinking. ''Guys,'' he'll say -- this is how he describes addressing the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- ''what if it doesn't work?'' An administration full of youthful true believers, enraptured with their heroic leader, needs a skeptic and a scold. Obama may need one himself. And yet Biden is also, like Obama, an optimist. As vice presidents go, he has more in common with Hubert Humphrey, the happy warrior, than with dark Dick Cheney. He may well, as Tom Lehrer once sang of Humphrey, dream of staging a coup; but he is likely to remain happy as long as he has apple carts to overturn. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama plans to lay out a time frame for  winding down the American involvement in the war in Afghanistan when he announces his decision this week to send more forces, senior administration officials said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although the speech was still in draft form, the officials said the president wanted to use the address at the United States Military Academy at West Point on Tuesday night not only to announce the immediate order to deploy roughly 30,000 more troops, but also to convey how he intends to turn the fight over to the Kabul government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's accurate to say that he will be more explicit about both goals and time frame than has been the case before and than has been part of the public discussion,'' said a senior official, who requested anonymity to discuss the speech before it is delivered. ''He wants to give a clear sense of both the time frame for action and how the war will eventually wind down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officials would not disclose the time frame.  But they said it would not be tied to particular conditions on the ground nor would it be as firm as the current schedule for withdrawing troops in Iraq, where Mr. Obama has committed to withdrawing most combat units by August and all forces by the end of 2011. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials of one allied nation who have been extensively briefed on the president's plan said, however, that Mr. Obama would describe how the American presence would be ratcheted back after the buildup, while making clear that a significant American presence in Afghanistan would remain for a long while. That is designed in part to signal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the United States will not abandon the region and to allay Pakistani fears that India will fill the vacuum created as America pulls back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some leading members of Congress talked publicly Sunday about their hope that the president would explain an endgame for American involvement in the eight-year war that includes how Afghans will assume more of their security needs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But more hawkish Republicans cautioned that setting a deadline for withdrawal could signal a lack of resolve to allies, including Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Talk of an exit strategy is exactly the wrong way to go,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. ''I certainly hope the president doesn't do that, because all that does is signal to the enemies and also to our allies, to the folks in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as the Afghanis, that we're not there to stay until the mission is accomplished.'' He spoke on ''Fox News Sunday.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior lawmakers also warned the White House on Sunday that its expected troop buildup in Afghanistan would fail unless the governments of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did more to combat militants attacking American forces, a concern that administration officials concede is a major vulnerability in President Obama's new war strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The key here is an Afghan surge, not an American surge,'' Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' ''And if the president lays out the case for why our combat forces that are going particularly to the south will increase the speed-up of the Afghan Army, it seems to me that that would be very, very important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the cost of the war rising, some Democrats have even talked of a surtax. And a Republican senator, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, asked: ''If we were talking about several years of time, how many more years beyond that? What is the capacity of our country to finance this particular type of situation as opposed to other ways of fighting Al Qaeda and the war against terror?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At West Point, Mr. Obama was expected to describe commitments from Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, and specific benchmarks his government must meet: to crack down on corruption, deploy well-trained Afghan troops and police officers, and focus on development in one of the world's poorest nations. Mr. Obama was expected to be far less specific about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where Taliban leaders are commanding operations across the border against American forces, and where Al Qaeda's central leadership still lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We agree that no matter how many troops you send, if the safe haven in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't cracked, the whole mission is compromised,'' said one official who has participated in the debate over the strategy. ''But if you make too many demands on the Pakistanis in public, it can backfire.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The problems in Afghanistan have only been compounded by the fragility of Mr. Obama's partner in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President Asif Ali Zardari, who is so weak that his government seems near collapse. On Friday, Mr. Zardari relinquished his position in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nuclear command structure, turning it over to the prime minister, in what appeared to be an effort to avoid impeachment or prosecution, and retain at least a figurehead post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, one of the Obama administration's staunchest allies, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, joined in the campaign to press </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to step up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Al Qaeda's leadership in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unruly tribal areas and other militant groups there. ''People are going to ask why, eight years after 2001, Osama bin Laden has never been near to being caught,'' Mr. Brown told Sky News, ''and what can the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorities do that is far more effective.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White House officials have said relatively little about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side of the administration's evolving war strategy, in part because they have so few options and so little leverage. They cannot send troops into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and they cannot talk publicly about one of their most effective measures, the Central Intelligence Agency's Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everyone understands this is a complex, nuanced, critical relationship,'' said a senior American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Mr. Obama's review had not been announced. ''Everyone has their eyes open, and there are genuine concerns. But one focus now is on trying to expand cooperation. The Pakistanis are doing some positive things in the tribal areas. That presents opportunities on which to build.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's advisers previously signaled that the president wanted to outline, as he had before, expectations for the Afghan government. This time, they said, the goals would be more explicit and demanding, aimed at improving governance and curbing corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the advisers have been debating whether to put deadlines on those benchmarks, like the pace of training Afghan security forces to defend their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top NATO and American commander in Afghanistan, is expected to testify about Mr. Obama's new strategy on Dec. 8 to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees in Washington, the official said. His appearance is expected to follow Congressional testimony later this week by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The administration has sought to build consensus among crucial allies to reach this point. In the last two weeks, Mr. Obama dispatched two top aides to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to deliver the same message: Keep the pressure on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In separate visits to Islamabad, the capital, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon E. Panetta, and the president's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, told Pakistani officials that no matter how many more troops the president sent to Afghanistan, the effort would fail unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increased </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Al Qaeda's leadership and Mullah Muhammad Omar and the leadership of the Afghan Taliban in the southern Pakistani city of Quetta, and the Haqqani network, militants operating out of North Waziristan who have attacked Afghan and NATO targets in eastern Afghanistan and Kabul, the Afghan capital. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama focused his speech on Afghanistan. He left much unsaid about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where the main terrorists he is targeting are located, but where he can send no troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama could not be very specific about his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy, his advisers conceded on Monday evening. American operations there are classified, most run by the Central Intelligence Agency. Any overt American presence would only fuel anti-Americanism in a country that reacts sharply to every missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against extremists that kills civilians as well, and that fears the United States is plotting to run its government and seize its nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet quietly, Mr. Obama has authorized an expansion of the war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well -- if only he can get a weak, divided, suspicious Pakistani government to agree to the terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, in addition to providing White House officials with classified assessments about Afghanistan, the C.I.A. delivered a plan for widening the campaign of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sending additional spies there and securing a White House commitment to bulk up the C.I.A.'s budget for operations inside the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The expanded operations could include </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the southern province of Baluchistan, where senior Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding, officials said. It is from there that they direct many of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American troops, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that are likely to increase as more Americans pour into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The president endorsed an intensification of the campaign against Al Qaeda and its violent allies, including even more operations targeting terrorism safe havens,'' said one American official. ''More people, more places, more operations.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was the message delivered in recent weeks to Pakistani officials by Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser. But the Pakistanis, suspicious of Mr. Obama's intentions and his staying power, have not yet agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Jones was one of a series of American officials who arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks with the same message: no matter how many troops the president commits to Afghanistan, the strategy will founder unless the safe haven inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dealt with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the United States does not have much leverage and is counting on a new attitude and a huge acceleration of efforts from a weak government. Making matters worse, the president, Asif Ali Zardari, is often at odds with the nation's powerful military and intelligence establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question about Mr. Obama's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy is whether the new commitment of troops and resources can ultimately make America safer at a time of an evolving terrorist threat. Mr. Obama insisted that was his central focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by Al Qaeda,'' he said to the cadets at West Point, speaking of both Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and the murky border area between the two that offers refuge to extremists of many stripes. The region was the birthplace of the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he said, and ''it is from here that new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being plotted as I speak.'' Many times in the speech he returned to that threat, saying it was what made this war different from Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he referenced another threat, one that focuses the attention of Mr. Obama's national security team daily, but which it speaks about rarely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, because we know that Al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's decision to raise the nuclear specter was notable because a succession of American officials have publicly stated recently that the Pakistani arsenal is secure. In private, however, they have commissioned new intelligence studies on how vulnerable Pakistani warheads and laboratories would be if insurgents made greater inroads, with one official saying recently, ''It is the scenario we spend the most time thinking about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if Mr. Obama is successful in lessening the terrorist threat in the region, many analysts say that Al Qaeda has changed into a transnational movement beyond Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no direct impact on stopping terrorists around the world because we are or are not in Afghanistan,'' said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, the former C.I.A. officer who was sent into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after 9/11 to determine if Osama bin Laden had access to the country's nuclear technology. The nature of modern terrorism, Mr. Mowatt-Larssen, now at Harvard, argued, is that a safe haven can be moved to many different states, and the bigger threat exists in cells, including in Europe and the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, acknowledged in an interview this evening that the steps announced by the president would not address Al Qaeda cells in Africa or the Middle East, or even homegrown extremists. But she argued that he had to begin somewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Can you totally eliminate the threat from Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda types in Yemen or Somalia? No,'' she said. ''But what you have done is taken a major action to limit their ability out of this major theater, from which their leaders and major actions emanate.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Making the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan even more complex was Mr. Obama's effort to reconcile two seemingly contradictory messages on Tuesday evening. He had to convince the Pakistanis that he was not planning to leave the region -- as the United States did 20 years ago, after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan -- while reassuring American citizens that after an 18-month buildup, he would begin to head for the exits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States, he said, simply could not afford an open-ended war. Unlike President Bush, he suggested, he would not set ''goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests.''  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST POINT, N.Y. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama announced Tuesday that he would speed 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in coming months, but he vowed to start bringing American forces home in the middle of 2011, saying the United States could not afford and should not have to shoulder an open-ended commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Promising that he could ''bring this war to a successful conclusion,'' Mr. Obama set out a strategy that would seek to reverse Taliban gains in large parts of Afghanistan, better protect the Afghan people, increase the pressure on Afghanistan to build its own military capacity and a more effective government and step up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Al Qaeda in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America, we are passing through a time of great trial,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The military escalation Mr. Obama described and defended in his speech to a national television audience and 4,000 cadets at the United States Military Academy here, the culmination of a review that lasted three months, could well prove to be the most consequential decision of Mr. Obama's presidency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his 33-minute address, he sought to convince an increasingly skeptical nation that the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the continued existence of Al Qaeda across the border in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- what he called a ''cancer'' on the region -- were direct threats to the United States, and that he could achieve the seemingly contradictory goals of expanding American involvement in the war even as he sought to bring it to a close. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The scene in the hall was striking and somber: row after row of cadets, in their blue-gray uniforms, listening intently to a strategy that could put many of them in harm's way. ''If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So no, I do not make this decision lightly.'' He called on foreign allies to step up their commitment, declaring, ''This is not just America's war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He delivered a pointed message to Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, saying, ''The days of providing a blank check are over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Addressing critics who have likened Afghanistan to Vietnam, Mr. Obama called the comparison ''a false reading of history.'' And he spoke directly to the American people about the tough road ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Let me be clear: none of this will be easy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in  the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the economy weak and the issue of jobs foremost on Americans' minds, the president conceded that the new strategy would carry an expensive price tag, which he put at an additional $30 billion in the first year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet with some Democrats talking of a war surtax, Mr. Obama offered no details of how he intended to pay for his new policy, saying only that he was ''committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White House advisers said they expected the administration would do so in the coming weeks, as officials including Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testify on Capitol Hill starting Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The approach laid out by Mr. Obama -- not so much a new strategy as a doubling down on the one he embraced earlier this year -- incorporated the basic goals and came close to the force levels proposed in the counterinsurgency plan that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top military commander in Afghanistan, put forward in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In that report, General McChrystal said, in stark language, that unless significantly more troops were sent, the war in Afghanistan was likely to be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by including an explicit timetable to begin a withdrawal, Mr. Obama highlighted the seemingly conflicting pressures defining the debate over how to proceed: to do what is necessary to ensure that the region is not a launching pad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the United States and its allies, and to disengage militarily as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior administration officials suggested, however, that any initial withdrawal starting in mid-2011 could be very limited, depending on the military situation at that point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The pace, the nature and the duration of that transition are to be determined down the road by the president based on the conditions on the ground,'' said Michele A. Flournoy, under secretary of defense for policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The initial political reactions showed the crosscurrents facing the White House. Republicans applauded the buildup of troops but questioned the commitment to a timetable for bringing them home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Setting a draw-down date before this surge has even begun is a mistake, and it sends a mixed message to both our friends and our enemies regarding our long-term commitment to success,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But among many Democrats, the response ranged from noncommittal to outright opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I see no good reason for us to send another 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan when we have so many pressing issues  --  like our economy  --  to deal with in this country,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama is calculating, administration officials said, that the explicit promise of a drawdown will impress upon the Afghan government that his commitment is not open-ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama was less clear publicly on how he planned to address the issue of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which many administration officials say will prove to be a far more intractable problem in the long term than Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials said that Mr. Obama had signed off on a plan by the Central Intelligence Agency to expand C.I.A. activities in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The  plan calls for more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against militants by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft, sending additional spies to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and securing a White House commitment to bulk up the C.I.A.'s budget for operations inside the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The expanded operations could include </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the southern province of Baluchistan, where senior Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new Afghanistan strategy draws heavily on lessons learned from Mr. Bush's ''surge'' and strategy shift in Iraq in 2007, which Mr. Obama opposed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the influx of troops and the training of the Afghan Army, administration officials said they were taking other lessons from the Iraq buildup, like empowering local security forces to stand up to Taliban militants in their communities and enhancing the training of national forces by embedding American troops with Afghan counterparts and later pairing American and Afghan units  to fight side by side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 30,000 troops that Mr. Obama is sending are part of what one administration official characterized as a short-term, high-intensity effort to regain the initiative against the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Administration officials said that they were hoping to get a commitment for an additional 5,000 to 8,000 troops from NATO allies -- perhaps as early as Friday at a foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels -- which would bring the number of additional troops in Afghanistan to close to the 40,000 that General McChrystal was seeking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama is sending three of the four brigades requested by General McChrystal. The first Marines will begin arriving as early as Christmas, and all forces will be in place by May, a senior administration official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 30,000 new American troops will focus on securing and protecting the country's top population centers, including Kabul, Khost and Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual capital. Military officials said that two brigades would go south, with the third going to eastern Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military officers said that they could maintain pressure on insurgents in remote regions by using surveillance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and reports from people in the field to find pockets of Taliban fighters and to guide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in particular by Special Operations forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The strategy also includes expanded economic development and reconciliation with less radical members of the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Mr. Obama is making tougher demands on the Afghan government; he spent an hour on the phone Monday with Mr. Karzai, White House officials said, and pressed him on the need to combat the corruption and drug trafficking, which many Western officials say has fueled the resurgence of the Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the  conversation, Mr. Obama, described by one White House official as ''very explicit,'' pressed Mr. Karzai on the need to take steps that would show progress. Mr. Obama congratulated Mr. Karzai on setting up a corruption task force, but also pressed him on the need to make sure that officials  appointed by the government are untainted by corruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Central Intelligence Agency sharpshooters killed eight people suspected of being militants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and wounded two others in a compound that was said to be used for terrorist training. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, the job in North Waziristan done, the C.I.A. officers could head home from the agency's Langley, Va., headquarters, facing only the hazards of the area's famously snarled suburban traffic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was only the latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the agency's covert program to kill operatives of Al Qaeda, the Taliban and their allies using Hellfire missiles fired from Predator aircraft controlled from half a world away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House has authorized an expansion of the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas, officials said this week, to parallel the president's decision, announced Tuesday, to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. American officials are talking with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the possibility of striking in Baluchistan for the first time -- a controversial move since it is outside the tribal areas -- because that is where Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to hide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By increasing covert pressure on Al Qaeda and its allies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while ground forces push back the Taliban's advances in Afghanistan, American officials hope to eliminate any haven for militants in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Washington's worst-kept secrets, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program is quietly hailed by counterterrorism officials as a resounding success, eliminating key terrorists and throwing their operations into disarray. But despite close cooperation from Pakistani intelligence, the program has generated public anger in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and some counterinsurgency experts wonder whether it does more harm than good. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assessments of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign have relied largely on sketchy reports in the Pakistani press, and some have estimated several hundred civilian casualties. Saying that such numbers are wrong, one government official agreed to speak about the program on the condition of anonymity. About 80 missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks from drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in less than two years have killed ''more than 400'' enemy fighters, the official said, offering a number lower than most estimates but in the same range. His account of collateral damage, however, was strikingly lower than many unofficial counts: ''We believe the number of civilian casualties is just over 20, and those were people who were either at the side of major terrorists or were at facilities used by terrorists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That claim, which the official said reflected the Predators' ability to loiter over a target feeding video images for hours before and after a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to come under scrutiny from human rights advocates. Tom Parker, policy director for counterterrorism at Amnesty International, said he found the estimate ''unlikely,'' noting that reassessments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in past wars had usually found civilian deaths undercounted. Mr. Parker said his group was uneasy about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anyway: ''Anything that dehumanizes the process makes it easier to pull the trigger.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet with few other tools to use against Al Qaeda, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress and was escalated by the Obama administration in January. More C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been conducted under President Obama than under President George W. Bush. The political consensus in support of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, its antiseptic, high-tech appeal and its secrecy have obscured just how radical it is. For the first time in history, a civilian intelligence agency is using robots to carry out a military mission, selecting people for killing in a country where the United States is not officially at war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C.I.A. officials were not eager to embrace killing terrorists from afar with video-game controls, said one former intelligence official. ''There was also a lot of reluctance at Langley to get into a lethal program like this,'' the official said. But officers grew comfortable with the program as they checked off their hit list more than a dozen notorious figures, including Abu Khabab al-Masri, a Qaeda expert on explosives; Rashid Rauf, accused of being the planner of the 2006 trans-Atlantic airliner plot; and Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warfare pioneered by the C.I.A. in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Air Force in Iraq and Afghanistan is the leading edge of a wave of push-button combat that will raise legal, moral and political questions around the world, said P. W. Singer, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of the book ''Wired for War.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Forty-four countries have unmanned aircraft for surveillance, Mr. Singer said. So far, only the United States and Israel have used the planes for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but that number will grow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're talking about a technology that's not going away,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is little doubt that ''warheads on foreheads,'' in the macho lingo of intelligence officers, have been disruptive to the militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, removing leaders and fighters, slowing movement and sowing dissension as survivors hunt for spies who may be tipping off the Americans. Yet the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are unpopular with many Pakistanis, who see them as a violation of their country's sovereignty -- one reason the United States refuses to officially acknowledge the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A poll by Gallup </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last summer found only 9 percent of Pakistanis in favor of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and 67 percent against, with a majority ranking the United States as a greater threat to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than its archrival, India, or the Pakistani Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interestingly, residents of the tribal areas where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actually occur, who bitterly resent the militants' brutal rule, are far less critical of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Farhat Taj, an anthropologist with the Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy. A study of 550 professional people living in the tribal areas was conducted late last year by the institute, a Pakistani research group. About half of those interviewed called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''accurate,'' 6 in 10 said they damaged militant organizations, and almost as many denied they increased anti-Americanism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Taj, who lived at the edge of the tribal areas until 2002, said residents would prefer to be protected by the Pakistani Army. ''But they feel powerless toward the militants and they see the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as their liberator,'' she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview this week with the German magazine Der Spiegel, the Pakistani prime minister, Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''do no good, because they boost anti-American resentment throughout the country.'' American officials say that despite such public comments, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> privately supplies crucial intelligence, proposes targets and allows the Predators to take off from a base in Baluchistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> public criticism of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has muddied the legal status of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which United States officials say are justified as defensive measures against groups that have vowed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans. Philip Alston, the United Nations' special rapporteur for extrajudicial executions and a prominent critic of the program, has said it is impossible to judge whether the program violates international law without knowing whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> permits the incursions, how targets are selected and what is done to minimize civilian casualties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for the C.I.A., Paul Gimigliano, defended the program without quite acknowledging its existence. ''While the C.I.A. does not comment on reports of Predator operations, the tools we use in the fight against Al Qaeda and its violent allies are exceptionally accurate, precise and effective,'' he said. ''Press reports suggesting that hundreds of Pakistani civilians have somehow been killed as a result of alleged or supposed U.S. activities are -- to state what should be obvious under any circumstances -- flat-out false.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From 2004 to 2007, the C.I.A. carried out only a handful of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But pressure from the Congressional intelligence committees, greater confidence in the technology and reduced resistance from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led to a sharp increase starting in the summer of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former C.I.A. officials say there is a rigorous protocol for identifying militants, using video from the Predators, intercepted cellphone calls and tips from Pakistani intelligence, often originating with militants' resentful neighbors. Operators at C.I.A. headquarters can use the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> video feed to study a militant's identity and follow fighters to training areas or weapons caches, officials say. Targeters often can see where wives and children are located in a compound or wait until fighters drive away from a house or village before they are hit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mehsud's wife and parents-in-law were killed with him, but that was an exceptional decision prompted by the rare chance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> him, the official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New America Foundation, a policy group in Washington, studied press reports and estimated that since 2006 at least 500 militants and 250 civilians had been killed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A separate count, by The Long War Journal, found 885 militants'  deaths and 94 civilians'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the government official insisted on the accuracy of his far lower figure of approximately 20 civilian deaths, noting that the Pakistani press rarely reported local protests about civilian deaths, routine occurrences when bombs in Afghanistan have gone astray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel S. Markey, who studies South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the comments of two anti-Taliban tribal leaders he spoke with on a recent trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to capture the paradox of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tribal leaders told him that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were eliminating dangerous militants while causing few civilian deaths. But they pleaded for a halt to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stirred up anger toward the United States and the Pakistani Army, and ''made them look like puppets,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It gave the lie,'' Mr. Markey said, ''to the argument we've made for a long time: that this fight is theirs, too.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabul, Afghanistan </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S decision on a timetable for withdrawal of American troops only makes official what everyone here has known for a while: the clock is ticking in Afghanistan. The Taliban have long recognized this, and many captured militants have reminded their interrogators that ''you have the watches, but we have the time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As we quicken the pace, the top American commander here, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, has repeatedly noted that there are many issues to focus on: building more competent Afghan Army and police forces, adopting more effective anticorruption measures and reintegrating ''moderate'' Taliban and other insurgent fighters into Afghan society and politics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But perhaps the most difficult issue is largely outside of General McChrystal's control (and got short shrift in President Obama's speech at West Point): undermining the Taliban's sanctuary in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Thus far, there has been no substantive action taken against the Taliban leadership in Baluchistan Province, south of the Pashtun-dominated areas of Afghanistan. This is the same mistake the Soviets made in the 1980s, when they failed to act against the seven major mujahadeen groups headquartered in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This sanctuary is critical because the Afghan war is organized and run out of Baluchistan. Virtually all significant meetings of the Taliban take place in that province, and many of the group's senior leaders and military commanders are based there. ''The Taliban sanctuary in Baluchistan is catastrophic for us,'' a Marine told me on a recent trip to Afghanistan's Helmand Province, across the border from Baluchistan. ''Local Taliban fighters get strategic and operational guidance from across the border, as well as supplies and technical components for their improvised explosive devices.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like a typical business, the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have an organizational structure divided into functional committees. It has a media committee; a military committee; a finance committee responsible for acquiring and managing funds; and so forth. The Taliban's inner shura, or governing council, exerts authority over lower-level Taliban fighters. It is composed of the supreme Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, his principal deputy, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, his military commander, Abdullah Zakir, and roughly a dozen other key leaders. Many Taliban leaders have moved their families to Baluchistan, and their children attend Pakistani schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mullah Baradar is particularly important because he runs many of the shuras involving senior Taliban commanders, virtually all of which are in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''Omar is reclusive and unpolished,'' one Taliban figure recently said to me, ''and has preferred to confide in a small number of trusted advisers rather than address larger groups.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States have failed to target them systematically. Pakistani Army and Frontier Corps forces have conducted operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tribal areas to the north, and the United States has conducted many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there. But relatively little has been done in Baluchistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must target Taliban leaders in Baluchistan. There are several ways to do it, and none requires military forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first is to conduct raids to capture Taliban leaders in Baluchistan. Most Taliban are in  or near  Baluchi cities like Quetta. These should be police and intelligence operations, much like American-Pakistani efforts to capture Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other Qaeda operatives after 9/11. The second is to hit Taliban leaders with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have done so effectively in the tribal areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cost of failing to act in Baluchistan will be enormous. As one Russian diplomat who served in the Soviet Army in Afghanistan recently told me: ''You are running out of time. You must balance counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan by targeting the leadership nodes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Don't make the same mistake we did.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- These are emotional times in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, particularly sincePresident Obama told its leaders last week to fight harder against Islamist extremists, and expanded a deeply unpopular covert air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Obama's speech at West Point, newspapers and talk shows here were full of heated commentary that those demands would push </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further toward disaster. ''Approval of increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' blared one headline. ''A very difficult time is approaching for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' a former foreign secretary intoned on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the feeling is not hard to understand. Who would want another country using missiles against targets in one's own? But there was something else, an anti-Americanism whose depth and intensity I could not fully grasp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What I got was not so much an explanation as an illustration, in all its anger, of the embittered language in which a great many Pakistanis discuss their relationship with America -- living proof of just how different America's understanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is from its own view of itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The real terrorists are not the men in turbans we see on Al Jazeera,'' said the psychiatrist, Dr. Malik H. Mubbashar, vice chancellor of the University of Health Sciences in Lahore. ''They are wearing Gucci suits and Brit hats. It's your great country, Madam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked him to spell it out. ''It's coming from Americans, Jews and Indians,'' he said. ''It's an axis of evil that's being supervised by you people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not such an unusual view in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even if the tone was particularly harsh. At 62 years old, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is something of a teenager among nations, even in its frame of mind -- self-conscious, emotional, quick to blame others for its troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was born in 1947, in a bloody, wrenching partition from India in which hundreds of thousands were killed. That traumatic event left deep scars on the psyches of both nations, and locked the countries into a perilous rivalry in ways that foreign observers often fail to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while India closed itself off, eliminated its feudal system and developed its economy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kept a corrosive system of feudal privilege and went through decades of political upheaval. And India still looms large in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collective imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We didn't heal very well after the partition because we didn't deal with it,'' said Ishma Alvi, a psychologist  in Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So it is natural that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security concerns focus much more on its eastern border with India, where the rivalry over who controls Kashmir festers, and less on its western border with Afghanistan -- a smaller, weaker country that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has traditionally been able to influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is that focus that Americans now insist that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> change, and it is not irrational that Pakistanis are resisting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India have fought three wars (or four, depending on who's counting) and India maintains a large force along its border. India has also poured money into Afghanistan, raising hackles on this side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are facts that Pakistanis like Dr. Mubbashar believe the United States willfully ignores as it single-mindedly pursues its own interests, as it did in the 1980s when it was confronting the Soviets. Washington now sees the Taliban and Al Qaeda as the biggest threat in the region, and is exasperated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a clash of narratives,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former ambassador to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Being a diplomat, Ms. Lodhi speaks in a low key. But not  Dr. Mubbashar, whose brand of patriotism may sound paranoid to an American, but is shared by many Pakistanis. He asserted that the American security company formerly known as Blackwater, a favorite target of criticism for ultranationalists, rented a house next to his, and that its employees had been trying to lure his servants with sweets, alcohol and ''McDonald's food every Sunday.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conspiracy theories are pervasive in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and Ms. Alvi offered an explanation. They are a projection, she said -- a defense mechanism that protects one's psyche from something too difficult to accept. ''It's not me, it's you,'' she said. ''It's a denial of personal responsibility, which goes a long way to cripple our growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has begun challenging the Islamist extremists on its border and the extremists have directed bombings against Pakistani citizens and institutions. Even so, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful news media aggressively trumpet the conspiracy theories, which are consumed by anyone who picks up a paper or turns on a TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are exceptions, and I stumbled upon one in the most unlikely of people, the elderly father of a young jihadi. A retired telephone operator living in a working class area of Islamabad, the man blamed his son's ways not on India or America, but squarely on the Pakistani groups that lured him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke in the broken, bitter manner of a father who had lost his son, but went out of his way to tell me that foreigners, whatever their faith, would always be welcome in his home. ''Islam treats foreigners according to their wishes,'' he said, sitting cross legged on the floor of a bare room. ''It's not what these people say -- killing them or asking others to terrorize them,'' he said contemptuously of the militants. ''We must treat everybody equally. Christians, Jews, Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently has begun asking hard questions about who it is. The freeing of the news media seven years ago, as unruly as it is, opened the floodgates. Musicians and artists are wrestling with Pakistani identity in new ways, and self-awareness is growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our healing is recent,'' Ms. Alvi said. ''Before, we were very confused about who and what we were.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But she said there is still a long way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A giant step forward would be to take responsibility,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The planPresident Obama unveiled last week for Years 9 and 10 of the war in Afghanistan left a basic question begging for an answer: If Al Qaeda is the threat, and Al Qaeda is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, why send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his address Tuesday night, the president mentioned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Pakistanis some 25 times, and called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan  collectively ''the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he might have had an easier time explaining what he was really proposing had he set the national boundaries aside and told Americans that the additional soldiers and marines were being sent to another land altogether: Pashtunistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That land is not on any map, but it's where leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban both hide. It straddles 1,000 miles of the 1,600-mile Afghan-Pakistani border. It is inhabited by the ethnic Pashtuns, a fiercely independent people that number 12 million on the Afghan side and 27 million on the Pakistani side. They have a language (Pashto), an elaborate traditional code of legal and moral conduct (Pashtunwali), a habit of crossing the largely unmarked border at will, and a centuries-long history of foreign interventions that ended badly for the foreigners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether Mr. Obama will have better luck there than PresidentGeorge W. Bush, the Soviet Politburo and British prime ministers back to the early 19th century remains to be seen. But it is there that the war will be fought, because it is there that the Taliban were spawned and where they now regroup, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and find shelter, for themselves and their Qaeda guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, the enemies of the United States are nearly all in Pashtunistan, an aspirational name coined long ago by advocates of an independent Pashtun homeland. From bases in the Pakistani part of it -- the Federally Administered Tribal Areas toward the north and Baluchistan province in the south -- Afghan Taliban leaders, who are Pashtuns, have plotted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Afghanistan. It is also from the Pakistani side of Pashtunistan that Qaeda militants have plotted terrorism against the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the essential strategic problem for the Americans has been this: their enemy, so far, has been able to draw advantage from the border between the two nation-states by ignoring it, and the Americans have so far been hindered because they must respect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan care deeply about their sovereign rights on either side of the line, but the Pashtuns themselves have never paid the boundary much regard since it was drawn by a British diplomat, Mortimer Durand, in 1893. ''They don't recognize the border,'' said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington policy group. ''They never have. They never will.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that has enormously complicated the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The Taliban can plan an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack from Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and execute it in Afghanistan. Their fighters -- or Al Qaeda's leaders -- can slip across the border to flee, or to rejoin the battle. At the same time, the Americans can fight openly only in Afghanistan, not in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and the Taliban know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American military officer who served at the border in 2003 and 2004 recalled Taliban fighters waving their rifles from the Pakistani side to taunt the Americans. ''Our rules said we couldn't follow them and we couldn't shoot at them unless they shot at us,'' the officer said. ''But when we saw them over the border, we knew we should expect an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that night. The only ones who recognized the border were us, with our G.P.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That has been changing all year, however, and it is about to change even more, as the Americans gear up for an intensified war on both sides of the line simultaneously. The dispatch of 30,000 additional Americans to the Afghan side of the border will occur simultaneously with more intensive missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes from drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft and Pakistani army offensives on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ever sinceOsama bin Laden escaped American forces in December 2001, crossing the mountains of Tora Bora from Afghanistan into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, American strategists have spoken of a ''hammer and anvil'' strategy to crush the militants. Until now, the border has proven so porous, and Pakistani governments so squeamish about a fight, that the American hammer in Afghanistan was pounding Taliban fighters there against a Pakistani pillow, not an anvil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, Mr. Obama's added troops are likely to be concentrated in the Taliban stronghold in Helmand and Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, and near Khost in the east. At the same time, the president has approved a major intensification of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even as the Pakistani army continues a campaign against the militants launched this fall in South Waziristan, following on a counterattack that swept militants last spring from the Swat Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We finally have an opportunity to do a real hammer-and-anvil strategy on the border,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows the Afghan war. ''We've never done it before because we've had insufficient strength on both sides of the border or insufficient political will on the Pakistani side.'' For years, in fact, Pakistani intelligence has played a double game with Islamist extremists, nurturing them as a force to use against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> archrival India in the disputed territory of Kashmir and helping create the Taliban as a buffer against Indian influence in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the mujahedeen who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s later turned on their American benefactors, so some militants in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have begun attacking the state that once encouraged them. Many in the Pakistani elite were stunned by the emergence in 2007 of the Pakistani Taliban and by the subsequent campaign of terrorist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> power structure, including the assassination ofBenazir Bhutto, suicide bombings in cities and an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the army headquarters in Rawalpindi in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, the militants struck again, storming a mosque near the army headquarters, spraying the crowd at Friday prayers with gunfire, hurling grenades and blowing themselves up. At least 36 worshippers were killed, including several high-ranking military officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The slaughter has changed the attitude of many Pakistanis, including government officials, about the wisdom of tolerating radical groups. And since last year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has offered quiet but crucial support for the C.I.A.'s use of missile-firing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including intelligence on militants' whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Now the Pakistanis are convinced they've crossed the Rubicon,'' said one former C.I.A. officer with long experience in the region. ''They know they can't do half measures.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is deeply divided, conditioned for decades to focus its security concerns on India. Popular opinion runs strongly against the United States. And Obama administration officials say they have not yet won Islamabad's support for major elements of the new war strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most significantly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has yet to agree to go after the leaders of the Afghan Taliban, or to permit American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hunt them in the province of Baluchistan, across the border from their former Afghani base in Kandahar. MullahMuhammad Omar, the cleric to whom even Mr. bin Laden has pledged fealty, operates now from near the Pakistani city of Quetta, as he helps oversee the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And history offers unnerving precedent for the Americans. In Waziristan, the patch of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where the Central Intelligence Agency now kills militants with missiles fired from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the British conducted what may have been history's first counterinsurgency air campaign, bombing from biplanes between 1919 and 1925.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Nawaz, of the Atlantic Council, whose grandfather fought with the British in Waziristan in 1901, said he saw in the shifting American policies an echo of the British experience; the British found themselves caught for decades in a cycle of rebellion, brutal suppression, payoffs for tribal leaders, and then a period of peace followed by a new rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the realistic time limits to American involvement, he said, the best possible outcome may be modest: ''to force the Taliban to come to terms and allow the U.S. an exit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even the prospect of an exit has hazards for the United States. The long Pashtun experience with war has taught them to favor those who look like winners, which is why the Taliban's successes in the last few years have lured fighters to their side. ''Our best hope for success,'' said Andrew M. Exum, who fought in Afghanistan as an Army captain in 2002 and 2004 and returned as a civilian adviser this year, ''is to fundamentally alter the balance of power in a way that favors the Afghan security forces over the Afghan Taliban.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, the fate of Mr. Obama's surge depends a lot on the hearts and minds of the Pashtuns -- and who seems a winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Congressional testimony last week,Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, said that was where the American interest comes in: A Taliban victory, he said, could give Al Qaeda not just a physical haven but a philosophical victory with profound consequences. ''The lesson of the Taliban's revival for Al Qaeda is that time and will are on their side, that with a Western defeat they could regain their strength and achieve a major strategic victory,'' Mr. Gates said. ''Rolling back the Taliban is now necessary, even if not sufficient, to the ultimate defeat of Al Qaeda.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Obama's speech at West Point, newspapers and talk shows here were full of heated commentary that those demands would push </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further toward disaster. ''Approval of increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' blared one headline. ''A very difficult time is approaching for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' a former foreign secretary intoned on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the feeling is not hard to understand. Who would want another country using missiles against targets in one's own?

That traumatic event left deep scars on the psyches of both nations, and locked the countries into a perilous rivalry in ways that foreign observers often fail to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while India closed itself off, eliminated its feudal system and developed its economy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kept a corrosive system of feudal privilege and went through decades of political upheaval. And India still looms large in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collective imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We didn't heal very well after the partition because we didn't deal with it,'' said Ishma Alvi, a psychologist  in Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So it is natural that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security concerns focus much more on its eastern border with India, where the rivalry over who controls Kashmir festers, and less on its western border with Afghanistan -- a smaller, weaker country that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has traditionally been able to influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is that focus that Americans now insist that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> change, and it is not irrational that Pakistanis are resisting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India have fought three wars (or four, depending on who's counting) and India maintains a large force along its border. India has also poured money into Afghanistan, raising hackles on this side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are facts that Pakistanis like Dr. Mubbashar believe the United States willfully ignores as it single-mindedly pursues its own interests, as it did in the 1980s when it was confronting the Soviets. Washington now sees the Taliban and Al Qaeda as the biggest threat in the region, and is exasperated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a clash of narratives,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former ambassador to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Being a diplomat, Ms. Lodhi speaks in a low key. But not  Dr. Mubbashar, whose brand of patriotism may sound paranoid to an American, but is shared by many Pakistanis. He asserted that the American security company formerly known as Blackwater, a favorite target of criticism for ultranationalists, rented a house next to his, and that its employees had been trying to lure his servants with sweets, alcohol and ''McDonald's food every Sunday.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conspiracy theories are pervasive in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and Ms. Alvi offered an explanation. They are a projection, she said -- a defense mechanism that protects one's psyche from something too difficult to accept. ''It's not me, it's you,'' she said. ''It's a denial of personal responsibility, which goes a long way to cripple our growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has begun challenging the Islamist extremists on its border and the extremists have directed bombings against Pakistani citizens and institutions. Even so, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful news media aggressively trumpet the conspiracy theories, which are consumed by anyone who picks up a paper or turns on a TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are exceptions, and I stumbled upon one in the most unlikely of people, the elderly father of a young jihadi. A retired telephone operator living in a working class area of Islamabad, the man blamed his son's ways not on India or America, but squarely on the Pakistani groups that lured him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke in the broken, bitter manner of a father who had lost his son, but went out of his way to tell me that foreigners, whatever their faith, would always be welcome in his home. ''Islam treats foreigners according to their wishes,'' he said, sitting cross legged on the floor of a bare room. ''It's not what these people say -- killing them or asking others to terrorize them,'' he said contemptuously of the militants. ''We must treat everybody equally. Christians, Jews, Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently has begun asking hard questions about who it is. The freeing of the news media seven years ago, as unruly as it is, opened the floodgates. Musicians and artists are wrestling with Pakistani identity in new ways, and self-awareness is growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our healing is recent,'' Ms. Alvi said. ''Before, we were very confused about who and what we were.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But she said there is still a long way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A giant step forward would be to take responsibility,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- These are emotional times in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, particularly sincePresident Obama told its leaders last week to fight harder against Islamist extremists, and expanded a deeply unpopular covert air </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in Pakistani territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. Obama's speech at West Point, newspapers and talk shows here were full of heated commentary that those demands would push </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further toward disaster. ''Approval of increasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' blared one headline. ''A very difficult time is approaching for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' a former foreign secretary intoned on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the feeling is not hard to understand. Who would want another country using missiles against targets in one's own? But there was something else, an anti-Americanism whose depth and intensity I could not fully grasp. So to find out where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> head was, I sought help from one of the country's top psychiatrists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What I got was not so much an explanation as an illustration, in all its anger, of the embittered language in which a great many Pakistanis discuss their relationship with America -- living proof of just how different America's understanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is from its own view of itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The real terrorists are not the men in turbans we see on Al Jazeera,'' said the psychiatrist, Dr. Malik H. Mubbashar, vice chancellor of the University of Health Sciences in Lahore. ''They are wearing Gucci suits and Brit hats. It's your great country, Madam.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked him to spell it out. ''It's coming from Americans, Jews and Indians,'' he said. ''It's an axis of evil that's being supervised by you people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not such an unusual view in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even if the tone was particularly harsh. At 62 years old, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is something of a teenager among nations, even in its frame of mind -- self-conscious, emotional, quick to blame others for its troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was born in 1947, in a bloody, wrenching partition from India in which hundreds of thousands were killed. That traumatic event left deep scars on the psyches of both nations, and locked the countries into a perilous rivalry in ways that foreign observers often fail to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while India closed itself off, eliminated its feudal system and developed its economy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kept a corrosive system of feudal privilege and went through decades of political upheaval. And India still looms large in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collective imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We didn't heal very well after the partition because we didn't deal with it,'' said Ishma Alvi, a psychologist  in Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So it is natural that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security concerns focus much more on its eastern border with India, where the rivalry over who controls Kashmir festers, and less on its western border with Afghanistan -- a smaller, weaker country that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has traditionally been able to influence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has articulated a reasonably comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan, but there is no chance of defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders stop temporizing (and in some cases collaborating) and get fully into the fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former President George W. Bush tried to buy off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military leaders who pocketed billions of dollars in American aid and continued to shelter the Taliban. Mr. Obama must demand more while finding ways to bolster the country's weak civilian leadership and soothe anti-American furies. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a world of difficult strategic and diplomatic challenges, this may well be Mr. Obama's toughest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his speech last week, Mr. Obama laid down a marker for Islamabad, declaring ''we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear.'' In private, administration officials have been even more explicit, warning Pakistani leaders that if they don't act the United States will, including with more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by unmanned aircraft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed several top extremists, but the program is hugely unpopular in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Obama must be judicious about expanding it. That means three things: extremely careful targeting, no civilian casualties or as few as possible, and no publicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't be enough. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civilian and military leaders must finally be persuaded that this is not just America's war, it is central to their survival. In recent months, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army has gone after Taliban fighters in the Swat Valley and Waziristan. Yet the Army leadership is refusing to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the heart of the Taliban command in Baluchistan Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In part, they are hesitating because of legitimate fears of retaliation. But there are also many Pakistani officials -- and not just in the intelligence services -- that continue to see the Taliban as an ally and long-term proxy to limit India's influence in Afghanistan.  To change that thinking, Mr. Obama will first have to persuade Pakistanis that the United States is in it for the long haul this time. The president sent conflicting messages in his speech, promising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a long-term partnership ''built on a foundation of mutual interest, mutual respect and mutual trust,'' but also suggesting that there will be a quick drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama privately has promised Pakistani military and civilian leaders what one aide described as a partnership of ''unlimited potential'' in which Washington would consider any proposal Islamabad puts on the table. Congress has already authorized a $7.5 billion aid package, over five years, for schools, hospitals and other nonmilitary projects. But this won't mean anything if it does not follow through and actually finance the program. The White House should also press Congress to pass long-stalled legislation to establish special trade preference zones in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Presuming security needs can be met, President Obama should visit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so he can tell Pakistanis directly that their fears of abandonment -- or domination -- are unfounded. Mr. Obama also must keep nudging India and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to improve relations. That may be the best hope for freeing up resources and mind-sets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the fight against the extremists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama told a small group of journalists at a White House lunch last week that reducing tensions between the two nuclear rivals, though enormously difficult, is ''as important as anything to the long-term stability of the region.'' He is right. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration is turning up the pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight the Taliban inside its borders, warning that if it does not act more aggressively the United States will use considerably more force on the Pakistani side of the border to shut down Taliban </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American forces in Afghanistan, American and Pakistani officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blunt message was delivered in a tense encounter in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month, before President Obama announced his new war strategy, when Gen. James L. Jones, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, and John O. Brennan, the White House counterterrorism chief, met with the heads of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military and its intelligence service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States officials said the message did not amount to an ultimatum, but rather it was intended to prod a reluctant Pakistani military to go after Taliban insurgents in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who are directing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For their part the Pakistanis interpreted the message as a fairly bald warning that unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved quickly to act against two Taliban groups they have so far refused to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States was prepared to take unilateral action to expand Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond the tribal areas and, if needed, to resume raids by Special Operations forces into the country against Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior administration official, asked about the encounter, declined to go into details but added quickly, ''I think they read our intentions accurately.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pakistani official who has been briefed on the meetings said, ''Jones's message was if that Pakistani help wasn't forthcoming, the United States would have to do it themselves.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American commanders said earlier this year that they were considering expanding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas, but General Jones's comments marked the first time that the United States bluntly told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it would have to choose between leading </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the insurgents inside the country's borders or stepping aside to let the Americans do it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The recent security demands followed an offer of a broader strategic relationship and expanded intelligence sharing and nonmilitary economic aid from the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politically weakened president, Asif Ali Zardari, replied in writing to a two-page letter that General Jones delivered from Mr. Obama. But Mr. Zardari gave no indication of how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would respond to the incentives, which were linked to the demands for greatly stepped-up counterterrorism actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've offered them a strategic choice,'' one administration official said, describing the private communications. ''And we've heard back almost nothing.'' Another administration official said, ''Our patience is wearing thin.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked Monday about the exchange, Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said, ''We have no comment on private diplomatic correspondence. As the president has said repeatedly, we will continue to partner with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the international community to enhance the military, governance and economic capacity of Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The implicit threat of not only ratcheting up the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but also launching more covert American ground raids would mark a substantial escalation of the administration's counterterrorism campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American Special Operations forces attacked Qaeda militants in a Pakistani village near the border with Afghanistan in early September 2008, in the first publicly acknowledged case of United States forces conducting a ground raid on Pakistani soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the raid caused a political furor in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with the country's top generals condemning the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States backed off what had been a planned series of such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his intensive review of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan strategy, officials say, Mr. Obama concluded that no amount of additional troops in Afghanistan would succeed in their new mission if the Taliban could retreat over the Pakistani border to regroup and resupply. But the administration has said little about the Pakistani part of the strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We concluded early on that whatever you do with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, you don't want to talk about it much,'' a senior presidential aide said last week. ''All it does is get backs up in Islamabad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his speech at West Point last week, Mr. Obama said that ''our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' But for the rest of the speech he referred to the country in the past tense, talking about how ''there have been those in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who've argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He never quite said how his administration views the Pakistanis today, and two officials said that Mr. Obama used that construction in an effort not to alienate the current government or the army, led by Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before Mr. Obama announced his decision last week, the White House had approved an expansion of the C.I.A.'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawless tribal areas. A missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from what was said to be a United States </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the tribal areas killed at least three people early Tuesday, according to Pakistani intelligence officials, The Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials, wary of civilian casualties and the appearance of further infringement of national sovereignty, are still in discussions with American officials over whether to allow the C.I.A. to expand its missile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Baluchistan for the first time -- a politically delicate move because it is outside the tribal areas. American commanders say this is necessary because Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader who ran Afghanistan before the 2001 invasion, and other Taliban leaders are hiding in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials also voice concern that if the Pakistani Army were to aggressively </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the two groups that most concern the United States -- the Afghan Taliban leaders and the Haqqani network based in North Waziristan -- the militants would respond with waves of retaliatory bombings, further undermining the weak civilian government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Publicly, senior American officials and commanders take note of that concern. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in late October with offers of a strategic partnership. But General Jones followed Mrs. Clinton  two weeks later carrying more sticks than carrots, American officials said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private security guards from Blackwater Worldwide participated in some of the C.I.A.'s most sensitive activities -- clandestine raids with agency officers against people suspected of being insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan and the transporting of detainees, according to former company employees and intelligence officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The raids against suspects occurred on an almost nightly basis during the height of the Iraqi insurgency from 2004 to 2006, with Blackwater personnel playing central roles in what company insiders called ''snatch and grab'' operations, the former employees and current and former intelligence officers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several former Blackwater guards said that their involvement in the operations became so routine that the lines supposedly dividing the Central Intelligence Agency, the military and Blackwater became blurred. Instead of simply providing security for C.I.A. officers, they say, Blackwater personnel at times became partners in missions to capture or kill militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, a practice that raises questions about the use of guns for hire on the battlefield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separately, former Blackwater employees said they helped provide security on some C.I.A. flights transporting detainees in the years after the 2001 terror </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The secret missions illuminate a far deeper relationship between the spy agency and the private security company than government officials had acknowledged. Blackwater's partnership with the C.I.A. has been enormously profitable for the North Carolina-based company, and became even closer after several top agency officials joined Blackwater. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It became a very brotherly relationship,'' said one former top C.I.A. officer. ''There was a feeling that Blackwater eventually became an extension of the agency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, would not comment on Blackwater's ties to the agency. But he said the C.I.A. employs contractors to ''enhance the skills of our own work force, just as American law permits.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Contractors give you flexibility in shaping and managing your talent mix -- especially in the short term -- but the accountability's still yours,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Blackwater, said Thursday that it was never under contract to participate in clandestine raids with the C.I.A. or with Special Operations personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater's role in the secret operations raises concerns about the extent to which private security companies, hired for defensive guard duty, have joined in offensive military and intelligence operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representative Rush D. Holt, a New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, said in an interview that ''the use of contractors in intelligence and paramilitary operations is a scandal waiting to be examined.'' While he declined to comment on specific operations, Mr. Holt said that the use of contractors in such operations ''got way out of hand.'' He added, ''It's been very troubling to a lot of people.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, has come under intense criticism for what Iraqis have described as reckless conduct by its security guards, and the company lost its lucrative State Department contract to provide diplomatic security for the United States Embassy in Baghdad earlier this year after a 2007 shooting that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater's ties to the C.I.A. have emerged in recent months, beginning with disclosures in The New York Times that the agency had hired the company as part of a program to assassinate leaders of Al Qaeda and to assist in the C.I.A.'s Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program in Afghanistan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, recently initiated an internal review examining all Blackwater contracts with the agency to ensure that the company was performing no missions that were ''operational in nature,'' according to one government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five former Blackwater employees and four current and former American intelligence officials interviewed for this article would speak only on condition of anonymity because Blackwater's activities for the agency were secret and former employees feared repercussions from the company. The Blackwater employees said they participated in the raids or had direct knowledge of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along with the former officials, they provided few details about the targets of the raids in Iraq and Afghanistan, although they said that many of the Iraq raids were directed against members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. To corroborate the claims of the company's involvement, a former Blackwater security guard provided photographs to The Times that he said he took during the raids. They showed detainees and armed men whom he and a former company official identified as Blackwater employees. The former intelligence officials said that Blackwater's work with the C.I.A. in Iraq and Afghanistan had grown out of its early contracts with the spy agency to provide security for the C.I.A. stations in both countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring of 2002, Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, offered to help the spy agency guard its makeshift Afghan station in the Ariana Hotel in Kabul. Not long after Mr. Prince signed the security contract with Alvin B. Krongard, then the C.I.A.'s third-ranking official, dozens of Blackwater personnel -- many of them former members of units of the Navy Seals or Army Delta Force -- were sent to provide perimeter security for the C.I.A. station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the company's role soon changed as Blackwater operatives began accompanying C.I.A. case officers on missions, according to former employees and intelligence officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A similar progression happened in Iraq, where Blackwater was first hired for ''static security'' of the Baghdad station. In addition, Blackwater was charged with providing personal security for C.I.A. officers wherever they traveled in the two countries. That meant that Blackwater personnel accompanied the officers even on offensive operations sometimes begun in conjunction with Delta Force or Navy Seals teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A former senior C.I.A. official said that Blackwater's role expanded in 2005 as the Iraqi insurgency intensified. Fearful of the death or capture of one of its officers, the agency banned officers from leaving the Green Zone in Baghdad without security escorts, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That gave Blackwater greater influence over C.I.A. clandestine operations, since company personnel helped decide the safest way to conduct the missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former American intelligence officials said that Blackwater guards were supposed to only provide perimeter security during raids, leaving it up to C.I.A. officers and Special Operations military personnel to capture or kill suspected insurgents or other targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They were supposed to be the outer layer of the onion, out on the perimeter,'' said one former Blackwater official of the security guards. Instead, ''they were the drivers and the gunslingers,'' said one former intelligence official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the chaos of the operations, the roles of Blackwater, C.I.A., and military personnel sometimes merged. Former C.I.A. officials said that Blackwater guards often appeared eager to get directly involved in the operations. Experts said that the C.I.A.'s use of contractors in clandestine operations falls into a legal gray area because of the vagueness of language laying out what tasks only government employees may perform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P.W. Singer, an expert in contracting at the Brookings Institution, said that the types of jobs that have been outsourced in recent years make a mockery of regulations about ''inherently governmental'' functions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We keep finding functions that have been outsourced that common sense, let alone U.S. government policy, would argue should not have been handed over to a private company,'' he said. ''And yet we do it again, and again, and again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to one former Blackwater manager, the company's involvement with the C.I.A. raids was ''widely known'' by Blackwater executives. ''It was virtually continuous, and hundreds of guys were involved, rotating in and out,'' over a period of several years, the former Blackwater manager said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One former Blackwater guard recalled a meeting in Baghdad in 2004 in which Erik Prince addressed a group of Blackwater guards working with the C.I.A. At the meeting in an air hangar used by Blackwater, the guard said, Mr. Prince encouraged the Blackwater personnel ''to do whatever it takes'' to help the C.I.A. with the intensifying insurgency, the former guard recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is not clear whether top C.I.A. officials in Washington knew or approved of the involvement by Blackwater officials in raids or whether only lower-level officials in Baghdad were aware of what happened on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new details of Blackwater's involvement in Iraq come at a time when the House Intelligence Committee is investigating the company's role in the C.I.A.'s assassination program, and a federal grand jury in North Carolina is investigating a wide range of allegations of illegal activity by Blackwater and its personnel, including gun running to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several former Blackwater personnel said that Blackwater guards involved in the C.I.A. raids used weapons, including sawed-off M-4 automatic weapons with silencers, that were not approved for use by private contractors. In separate interviews, former Blackwater security personnel also said they were handpicked by senior Blackwater officials on several occasions to participate in secret flights transporting detainees around war zones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They said that during the flights, teams of about 10 Blackwater personnel provided security over the detainees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A group of individuals were selected who could manage detainees without the use of lethal force,'' said one former Blackwater guard who participated in one of the flights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Intelligence officials deny that the agency has ever used Blackwater to fly high-value detainees in and out of secret C.I.A. prisons that were shut down earlier this year. Mr. Corallo, the Blackwater spokesman, said that company personnel were never involved in C.I.A. ''rendition flights,'' which transferred terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Intelligence Agency has terminated a contract with the security company formerly called Blackwater Worldwide that allowed the company to load bombs on C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, intelligence officials said Friday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contract gave employees with the company an operational role in one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most significant covert programs, which has killed dozens of militants with Predator and Reaper </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The company's involvement highlighted the extent to which the C.I.A. had outsourced critical jobs to private companies since the 9/11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contract with the company, now called Xe Services, was canceled this year by Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, according to a C.I.A. spokesman. In August, The New York Times first revealed the existence of the contract, which was run by a division of the company called Blackwater Select, which handles classified contracts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Little, the C.I.A. spokesman, said that Mr. Panetta had ordered that the agency's employees take over the jobs from Xe employees at the remote </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bases in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan, and that Mr. Panetta had also ordered a review of all contracts with the company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At this time, Blackwater is not involved in any C.I.A. operations other than in a security or support role,'' Mr. Little said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The disclosure about the terminated contract comes a day after The Times reported that Blackwater employees had joined C.I.A. operatives in secret ''snatch and grab'' operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackwater's role in the raids grew out of contracts that the company had with the spy agency to provide security for the C.I.A.  in Kabul and Baghdad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company had a dual role in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program, said current and former employees and  intelligence officials. Contractors on the secret bases assembled and loaded Hellfire missiles and 500-pound laser-guided bombs onto  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and they also provided  security at the C.I.A. bases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The C.I.A. did not allow contractors to select targets for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or pull the trigger on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That work was done at the C.I.A.'s headquarters in Langley, Va. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Blackwater's direct role in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operations sometimes led to disputes between the contractors and C.I.A. employees, as the spy agency sometimes accused Blackwater employees of poor weapon assembly if the missile or bomb missed a target. In one instance last year, a 500-pound bomb dropped off a Predator before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had launched its payload, leading to a frenzied search along the Afghan-Pakistani border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A company employee said the bomb was eventually found not far from the intended target. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American intelligence official said there were ''strong indications'' that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week killed Saleh al-Somali, a member of Al Qaeda's inner circle who was taking refuge in the mountainous tribal belt in western </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The report came amid a swirl of conflicting information about recent C.I.A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which have grown so frequent that several may occur in the same day. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pakistani officials said a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week killed another top Qaeda operative, Abu Yahya al-Libi, but American officials disputed that claim. Mr. Libi has emerged as one of the terror network's rising figures by posting dozens of radical videos on militants' Web sites, and the rumors of his death spread through jihadi Internet forums. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration in recent weeks has approved a C.I.A. plan to expand clandestine operations inside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aircraft in the country and flying them over a wider territory. The plan is awaiting approval by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has secretly shared intelligence with the United States for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has asked the United States to share the technology with it, the government publicly condemns the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. Somali was indeed killed, it would be a significant blow, an American official said. Little is known about Mr. Somali, but one American official said he was probably responsible for plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the West. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official said Mr. Somali  was the primary link between Qaeda leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the network's allies in East Africa, including the Somali militant group Al Shabaab.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the years passed after Sept. 11, 2001, without another major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American soil and with no sign of hidden terrorist cells, many counterterrorism specialists reached a comforting conclusion: Muslims in the United States were not very vulnerable to radicalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American Muslims, the reasoning went, were well assimilated in diverse communities with room for advancement. They showed little of the alienation often on display among their European counterparts, let alone attraction to extremist violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But with a rash of recent cases in which Americans have been accused of being drawn into terrorist scheming, the rampage at Fort Hood, Tex., last month and now the alarming account of five young Virginia men who went to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and are suspected of seeking jihad, the notion that the United States has some immunity against homegrown terrorists is coming under new scrutiny. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a concern that President Obama noted in passing in his address on the decision to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan, and one that has grown as the Afghan war and the hunt for Al Qaeda and the Taliban in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intensifies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These events certainly call the consensus into question,'' said Robert S. Leiken, who studies terrorism at the Nixon Center, a Washington policy institute, and wrote the forthcoming book ''Europe's Angry Muslims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The notion of a difference between Europe and United States remains relevant,'' Mr. Leiken said. But the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the American operations like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, are fueling radicalization at home, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just the length of U.S. involvement in these countries is provoking more Muslim Americans to react,'' Mr. Leiken said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Concern over the recent cases has profoundly affected Muslim organizations in the United States, which have renewed pledges to campaign against extremist thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Among leaders, there's a recognition that there's a challenge within our community that needs to be addressed,'' said Alejandro J. Beutel, government liaison at the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Washington, and main author of a report by the council on radicalization and how to combat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Beutel, a Muslim convert from New Jersey, said the council started a grass-roots counterradicalization effort in 2005, but acknowledged that ''for a while it was on the back burner.'' He said, ''Now we're going to revive it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  F.B.I. investigators were in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday questioning the five Virginia men. But it remained unclear whether the men would be deported to the United States, and whether they had broken any laws in either </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference Friday at the small Virginia mosque where the men had been youth group regulars, mosque officials expressed bewilderment at claims that the men wanted to join the jihad against American troops in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I never observed any extreme behavior from them,'' said Mustafa Maryam, who runs the youth group and said he had known the young men since 2006. ''They were fun-loving, career-focused children. They had a bright future before them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also at the press briefing, asked about reports that the five men had contacted a Pakistani militant via the Web, Mahdi Bray, the head of the Freedom Foundation of the Muslim American Society, told reporters that YouTube and social networking sites had become a dangerous recruiting tool for militants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are determined not to let religious extremists exploit the vulnerability of our children through this slick, seductive propaganda on the Internet,'' said Mr. Bray, who is organizing a youth meeting later this month in Chicago to address the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Silence in cyberspace is not an option for us,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detention of the Virginia men -- ranging in age from late teens to mid-20s -- would have prompted soul-searching no matter when it occurred. But it comes after a series of disturbing cases that already had terror experts speculating about a trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were the November shootings that took 13 lives at Fort Hood, with murder charges pending against Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an American-born Muslim and an Army psychiatrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was the arrest of Najibullah Zazi, born in Afghanistan but the seeming model of the striving immigrant as a popular coffee vendor in Manhattan, accused of going to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for explosives training with the intention of attacking in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American living in Chicago, accused of helping plan the killings in Mumbai, India, last year and of plotting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Denmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was Bryant Neal Vinas, a Muslim convert from Long Island who participated in a rocket </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on American troops in Afghanistan and used his knowledge of commuter trains in New York to advise Al Qaeda about potential targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were the Somali-Americans from Minnesota who had traveled to Somalia to join a violent Islamist movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And there were cases of would-be terrorists who plotted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Texas, Illinois and North Carolina with conspirators who turned out to be F.B.I. informants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University, said the recent cases only confirmed that it was ''myopic'' to believe ''we could insulate ourselves from the currents affecting young Muslims everywhere else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like many other specialists, Mr. Hoffman pointed to the United States' combat in Muslim lands as the only obvious spur to many of the recent cases, especially those with a Pakistani connection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The longer we've been in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' he said, ''the more some susceptible young men are coming to believe that it's their duty to take up arms to defend their fellow Muslims.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few analysts, in fact, argue that Mr. Obama's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan -- intended to prevent a terrorist haven there -- could backfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert A. Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, contends that suicide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are almost always prompted by resentment of foreign troops, and that escalation in Afghanistan will fuel more plots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This new deployment increases the risk of the next 9/11,'' he said. ''It will not make this country safer.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet amid the concern about the five Virginia men and the impact of the wars on Muslim opinion, Audrey Kurth Cronin of the National War College in Washington said she found something to take comfort in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''To me, the most interesting thing about the five guys is that it was their parents that went immediately to the F.B.I.,'' she said. ''It was members of the American Muslim community that put a stop to whatever those men may have been planning.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven months into this young presidency, a set of Obama principles is beginning to emerge: a philosophy about when to use American military force, when to forgo it and when to threaten its use to back up diplomatic pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the president described in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday was something short of an Obama doctrine; it may draw from too many different foreign policy philosophies to qualify for that status. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, President Obama reached for a pragmatic blend of pre-  and post-9/11 approaches for blending hard and soft power. He explored what happens when the concept of ''just and unjust wars'' intersects with the realities of commanding the only military that can act as the world's policeman of last resort. And the speech provided a rough road map of how he will navigate the hardest cases on his desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's speech, for an award his aides view as a decidedly mixed blessing, came at an inflection point in his presidency. It is a moment when diplomatic engagement is giving way to consideration of far tougher measures, from routing insurgents in a sovereign </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to deciding on far tougher sanctions, or confrontation, to slow Iran's nuclear progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And there are the continuing humanitarian disasters for which Mr. Obama told the Nobel committee ''force can be justified'' to protect civilians. He seemed to be thinking of the Darfur region in Sudan, as well as Somalia, Rwanda's 1994 genocide and perhaps the long-running cases of North Korea's gulags and Myanmar's repression. But in each, the world has not wanted to risk outright military intervention, and few other levers of influence, from peacekeepers to sanctions, have proved effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's evolving approach lacks bumper-sticker simplicity, a quality the White House views as its greatest virtue. It is far more shaded than the 2002 Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive action against emerging threats. Nor does Mr. Obama's approach have the boundaries and well-understood rules of cold-war-style containment, which started with the Truman administration, became the justification for Vietnam and ultimately succeeded, many historians believe, with the fall of the Berlin Wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by reaching back to the concept of ''just war'' at the moment he was accepting a prize for peace, Mr. Obama was signaling that after nearly a year in office, his views about the need to resort to force at times had begun to harden. The key paragraph in Oslo acknowledged the lessons drawn from the philosophies of nonviolence preached by Gandhi (who never won the Nobel Peace Prize) and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (who did, in 1964) and then made a decisive turn. As a head of state who must defend his country, Mr. Obama said, ''I cannot be guided by their examples alone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I face the world as it is,'' he declared, a phrase he later repeated to bolster his bona fides as a realist. ''For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That juxtaposition of Hitler and Al Qaeda makes it clear that Mr. Obama has no doubt that only force will work when it comes to dealing with the group that carried out the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps that explains a statistic that the White House has not advertised: Since Mr. Obama came to office, the Central Intelligence Agency has mounted more Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes into Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, mostly aimed at suspected Qaeda or Taliban havens, than during President George W. Bush's eight years in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, in Mr. Obama's world view, the war against Al Qaeda is the ultimate ''just war'' because it is directly linked to an act of aggression. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Mr. Obama's second year in office, the challenge will be how to prosecute such a war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the sovereign territory of an ally that, so far, has had neither the will nor the ability to take on Al Qaeda's top commanders. During a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, told Pakistani officials that Mr. Obama would not view the border dividing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Afghanistan as a barrier if he was responding to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emanating from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- which occur almost daily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iran is the other looming case. Mr. Obama made the argument in Oslo that his commitment to seeking a world without nuclear weapons -- one of the reasons he was awarded the prize -- would fail unless the world insisted ''that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet inside the White House there is real doubt that the world will stand as one. Russia and China are reluctant to sign on to sanctions against Iran, particularly sanctions that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at its oil exports or gasoline imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama declared that ''those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.'' But he stopped short of answering the hardest question about Iran: If diplomacy fails, would Israel be justified in striking Iran's nuclear facilities, as it has often hinted, because they pose an ''existential threat''? Even in the absence of evidence that Iran was planning an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or would that veer closer to Mr. Bush's justifications in 2003 for toppling Saddam Hussein, a dictator who was not preparing an imminent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of his own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Striking too early risks shades of Mr. Bush's pre-emption doctrine, a return to American unilateralism. Striking too late invites disaster. That conundrum is ''the world as it is.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven months into his presidency, a set of Obama principles, if not quite a doctrine, is beginning to emerge  --  a philosophy  about when to use American military force, when to forsake it and when to threaten its use to back up diplomatic pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday explored what happens when the concept of ''just and unjust wars'' intersects with the realities of commanding the only military that can act as the world's policeman of last resort. Just what does that speech suggest about how Mr. Obama will handle the hardest cases on his desk? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech came at an inflection point in Mr. Obama's presidency  --  a moment when diplomatic engagement is giving way to consideration of far tougher measures. Just a few weeks ago Mr. Obama's emissaries warned the Pakistani government that unless it gets serious about routing Al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban forces operating in its mountains and cities, he will. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is the imminent decision about how to corral the world's powers into truly effective sanctions on Iran  --  with the unspoken reality that if the effort fails, Mr. Obama and his allies may have to choose between living with a nuclear-capable Iran or living with the blowback from any military or covert </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to set back its program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And there are the continuing humanitarian disasters where Mr. Obama told the Nobel committee ''force can be justified'' to protect civilians. He seemed to be thinking of Sudan's Darfur region, Somalia,  Rwanda's 1994 genocide and perhaps the long-running cases of North Korea's gulags and Myanmar's repression. But in each, the world has not wanted to risk outright military intervention, and few other levers of influence, from peacekeepers to sanctions, have proved effective. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's evolving approach -- it may draw from too many different foreign policy philosophies to qualify as a doctrine --  lacks  bumper-sticker simplicity. It is far more shaded than the 2002 Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive action against emerging threats: After the failure to discover unconventional weapons in Iraq, Mr. Bush's theory lost so much credibility that he stopped talking about what constituted an imminent or severe enough threat for America to act alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor does Mr. Obama's approach have the boundaries and well-understood rules of cold-war-style containment, which started with the Truman administration, became the justification for Vietnam and ultimately succeeded, many historians believe, with the fall of the Berlin Wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As one of Mr. Obama's national security strategists put it just after the announcement of the decision to add 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, ''we live in messy times, which don't lend themselves to easy doctrines.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But by reaching back to the concept of ''just war'' at the moment  he was accepting a prize for peace, Mr. Obama was signaling that after nearly a year in office, his views about the need to resort to force at times have begun to harden. It was almost certainly not the speech that the Nobel committee expected to hear, nor the one Mr. Obama himself might have written six years ago. Then, as a state senator, he had used his opposition to the Iraq war to speak for the first time on issues of war and peace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The main paragraph in Oslo acknowledged the lessons drawn from the philosophies of nonviolence preached by Mahatma Gandhi (who never won the Nobel Peace Prize) and Martin Luther King (who did, in 1964) and then made a decisive turn. As a head of state who must defend his country, Mr. Obama said, ''I cannot be guided by their examples alone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I face the world as it is,'' Mr. Obama declared, a phrase he later repeated to bolster his bona fides as a realist. ''For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That juxtaposition of Hitler and Al Qaeda  made it clear that Mr. Obama has no doubt that only force will work when it comes to dealing with the group that carried out the Sept. 11 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps that explains a statistic that the White House has not  advertised: Since Mr. Obama came to office, the Central Intelligence Agency has mounted more Predator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">drone strikes into Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, mostly aimed at suspected Qaeda or Taliban  havens, than during Mr. Bush's eight years in office. (Armed Predators were in short supply during the first years of Mr. Bush's presidency.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, in Mr. Obama's world view, the war against Al Qaeda is the ultimate ''just war,'' because it is directly linked to an act of aggression. Similarly he praised the first President Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq in 1991 for its invasion of Kuwait the previous year, because it ''sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Mr. Obama's second year in office, the hard part of this calculation will be how to prosecute such a war in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  --  the sovereign territory of an ally that, so far, has had neither the will nor the ability to take on Al Qaeda in its own territory. During a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, told Pakistani officials that Mr. Obama would not view the border as a barrier if he was responding to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Al Qaeda or the Taliban emanating from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pakistan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  --  which occur almost daily. Yet on that issue, the president was silent in Oslo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iran is the other looming case. Mr. Obama made the argument in Oslo that his commitment to seeking a world without nuclear weapons  --  one of the reasons he was awarded the prize  --  would fail unless the world insisted ''that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sanctions must exact a real price,'' he said. ''Intransigence must be met with increased pressure  --  and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet inside the White House there is real doubt that the world will stand as one. Russia and China are reluctant to sign on to sanctions against Iran, particularly sanctions that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">strike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at its oil exports or gasoline imports. Mr. Obama declared that ''those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.'' But he stopped short of answering the hardest question about Iran, one he might face in months. In his conception of ''just war,'' would Israel be justified in striking Iran's nuclear facilities, as it has often hinted, because they pose an ''existential threat''? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or would that veer closer to Mr.  Bush's justifications for toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, a dictator who was not preparing an imminent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of his own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Walzer, the author of the classic work ''Just and Unjust Wars,'' published first in 1977 and updated through  decades of subsequent conflicts, large and small, wrote a few years ago that the Iraq invasion's ''cause was not (as in 1991) an actual Iraqi </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a neighboring state or even an imminent threat of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">attack;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor was the cause an actual, on-going massacre.'' Many of the threats Mr. Obama talked about  --  the plotting of terrorists in well-protected mountain redoubts, the gradual development of nuclear weapons capacity, ''genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma''  --  unfold over years. Each has proved resistant to preventive diplomacy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Striking too early risks shades of Mr. Bush's discredited pre-emption doctrine, a return to American unilateralism. Striking too late invites disaster. That conundrum is ''the world as it is.'' </SPAN></P>
